Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the 
importance of system resilience in confronting major crises. 
This paper leverages the systems thinking approach to 
emphasize the interactions and feedback among systems for 
fostering resilience from multiple levels and timing stages. This 
paper also emphasizes the impact of socio-technical systems on 
societal resilience, since it is a crucial aspect of resilience and is 
discussed in terms of its ability to disseminate information, 
policies, and promote system resourcefulness and flexibility. In 
addition, we analyze the interrelationships and interactions 
among systems at multiple levels, including macro-level 
(society), meso-level (community and local network), and 
micro-level (individual and families), to foster resilience from 
different angles. We also review policies that correspond to 
different spatial-temporal resilience stages (preparation, 
disturbance, 
recovery, 
transformation) 
to 
provide 
enlightenment for policymaking from a resilience thinking 
perspective. Our analysis reveals that a system's resilience 
relies on the interconnectedness and feedback mechanism 
among systems, and policy design should aim to minimize 
functionality loss in the shortest time to maintain robustness 
and rapidity in response. Additionally, the dynamic and 
unpredictable nature of the transformation process should be 
taken into account when implementing policies at different 
levels. Our study can serve as a future research path aiming at 
enhancing societal resilience in facing the challenges and 
preparing for potential pandemics in the future.

 INTRODUCTION 
The COVID-19 has triggered a global systemic crisis that 
reveals the vulnerability, fragility and uncertainty of the 
societal system at the beginning of the pandemic. While the 
end of the pandemic may be in sight, its variants will likely 
continue to coexist with society for a long time [1][2]. As we 
continue to study COVID-19, it has become clear the 
pandemic is not just a public health problem, but a social 
problem that requires effort from every aspect of the societal 
system to respond to the crisis. In this paper, we will discuss 
how to deal with COVID-19 and recover societal resilience 
from a systems thinking viewpoint in both the current and 
post-pandemic era. 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
resulting systemic crisis have affected almost everyone 
[3][4]. Given that we cannot avoid all risks, a new subject 
arises: what can be done to minimize disruption and damage, 
and restore social order with adaptivity, diversity, and 
stability? Severe disruptions like these prompt us to consider 
how we handle interruptions, withstand threats, and adapt to 
adverse situations in the future, at different levels. As a 
result, the concept of "resilience" has received considerable 
attention in the context of COVID-19 and the complex 
systems approach. The term "resilience" derives from the 
Latin word meaning "bounce back" [6], and it was initially 
used in ecosystems to enhance stability and sustainability by 
conserving biodiversity [1][7]. 
In recent years, resilience has been well developed and 
adapted to different societal system sectors such as socio-
ecology, socio-economic, socio-technology, and socio-
science [8]. In broad terms, system resilience refers to the 
ability of a complex system to return to pre-existing 
equilibrium better, with redundancy, after experiencing a 
crisis. It involves the capacity of individuals, families, or 
even the whole society to prepare, respond, absorb, adapt, 
and minimize the negative impact of the crisis [9][10]. For 
complex adaptive systems, resilience can be seen as the 
inherent property of the system [2] that represents a process 
by which complex systems absorb negative impacts from 
stress and disruption and improve functionality properly. 
Importantly, system resilience is not a transient state that 
causes deviation in functioning or behavior. Rather, it is a 
process by which a system can cope with disruption and 
adapt from crisis to transformation [11]. By understanding 
resilience in this way, we can better prepare and respond to 
crises like COVID-19, and ultimately, enhance the resilience 
of our societal systems. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 
II, this study employs a systems thinking approach to 
analyze interactions and feedback among systems in 
addressing the COVID-19 pandemic to get a holistic 
understanding of systemic resilience. Section III emphasizes 
the role of socio-technical systems in societal resilience. In 
section IV, we examine interrelationships at macro, meso, 
and micro levels, and explore how these interactions impact 
resilience across different stages and sectors. In section V, 
our research then reviews policies for various spatial-

contributes to current resilience research in complex system 
sectors, aiming to tackle crises effectively. 
II. 
COMPLEXITY OF SYSTEMIC RESILIENCE 
A. Resilience: More Than a Single System Feature 
The complex societal system implies that the world 
changes non-linearly and is composed of massively 
interconnected systems and networks [14]. The continued 
evolution of resilience originates from the interaction and 
interdependency of systems and environments [15][16]. 
Dynamic relationships are challenging to identify [17], 
whereas linearity usually cannot be used to describe 
interconnections and interactions within systems or to reflect 
the emergent properties of the complex societal system [3], 
[4]. Thus, we must re-examine the importance of resilience 
in complex systems, especially given the ongoing impact of 
the 
COVID-19 
and 
its 
variants. 
Overlooking 
the 
interconnectedness of resilience between systems will 
significantly increase the vulnerabilities of a systemic shock 
[5]. 
While enhancing and developing system integration has 
led to closely paired systems that improve efficiency and 
effectiveness 
in 
normal 
conditions 
[18], 
advanced 
technologies applied in continuously evolving systems with 
tight connections may result in negative effects being 
mapped onto other systems and causing a disruption of 
balance and normalcy [19].  Our tendency to target the most 
apparent problems without considering broader implications 
can lead to unforeseen consequences. For instance, the 
implementation of strict policies may overlook the 
complexity and interaction of the global economy and 
transportation, resulting in the creation of new social 
problems that accumulate over time [2]. 
B. Resilience: Facing The Interactions and Collectivity in 
The Dynamic World 
Moreover, even the resilience reflected in a single system 
may manifest in different ways, both within and beyond the 
system [20]. For example, the resilience of the healthcare 
system usually interweaves with the economic system, 
supply chain system, governance system and other related 
systems. A typical phenomenon is that during the early 
period of the pandemic, the healthcare system is not 
functioning properly due to the shortage of supplies, which is 
highly reliant on the supply chain and transportation system. 
At the same time, the supply chain and transportation system 
are highly dependent on the labor force, which increases the 
chance of massive transmission if they go back to work too 
soon, increasing the complexity of policymaking and 
pressure on the healthcare system [21]. System complexity 
can prompt societal development, but it can also cascade 
adverse effects, leading to system failure counterintuitively. 
Thus, it is essential to consider the interconnectedness of 
different systems in developing and implementing resilient 
policies. 
Considering the close intertwined problems from a 
complex systems viewpoint, society can be understood as a 
whole but structured into different systems based on societal 
elements and related factors and subsystems, such as the 
governance system, epidemiological factors, human activity, 
healthcare system, socio-technical system, and infrastructure 
system [4][20][22]. Multi-systems and factors of society are 
involved at various scales, as shown in Figure 1. In such a

Figure 2. A hierarchical schematic representation of systemic resilience 
complex societal system, system resilience is driven by both 
positive and negative outcomes, such as sudden changes or 
crises and the adaptation of new features, which can shape 
the complex system and impact resilience at different sectors 
and levels [15][22]. 
III. 
THE ROLE OF SOCIO-TECHNICAL SYSTEM RESILIENCE 
UNDER COVID-19 
A. Socio-technical System Aligned with the Concept of 
Society 5.0 
The COVID-19 is different from previous global crises 
because it happened after the integration of human-
technology interactions at the organizational or societal level.  
[17]. Therefore, we emphasize the role of the socio-technical 
system in systemic resilience, which indirectly affects the 
virus spread through information dissemination, policy 
implementation, and behavior change. The socio-technical 
system can be identified as the combination of human-
centered systems and technological systems [18]. Currently, 
the socio-technical system can be viewed as a complex 
system formed by the fusion of virtual and physical elements 
and components interacting with subsystems in society such 
as education, transportation, and healthcare system in 
society, affecting people’s daily life and decision-making 
process for stakeholders [10][19].  
The concept of Society 5.0 integrates society, human 
factors, and technology within a broader perspective, 
emphasizing the interrelatedness of functionalities within the 
societal system [19]. With the shift to Society 5.0, the socio-
technical system has become increasingly significant for 
ensuring system resilience, particularly for identifying and 
addressing heterogeneous threats. The socio-technical 
system is embedded within the societal system and interacts 
with multifaceted systems to make flexible and adaptive 
decisions, ensuring cohesion and resilience in fast-changing 
environments. The hyper-connectivity and communicability 
of different systems in the complex societal network allow 
them to be cascaded like nodes in a network, creating 
feedback loops characterized by interdependent and 
communicative systems, which serve as an essential layer to 
support system resilience. 
B. The Impact of Socio-technical System on Systemic 
Resilience 
On the one hand, the maturity of the infrastructure 
system, a result of globalization and urbanization, has 
accelerated the spread of the virus and negatively impacted 
societal resilience due to insufficient preparation and policy 
implementation at the beginning of the pandemic [1]. 
However, advances in socio-technology have also facilitated 
the dissemination of information and policies, changing hu- 
52

man behavior and awareness of the current COVID-19 and 
future crises [19]. The socio-technical system, by involving 
itself in every stage of the resilience process, promotes 
system resourcefulness and flexibility to solve difficulties.  
On the other hand, technology has played a crucial role in 
enhancing resilience at individual and systemic levels by 
enabling innovative risk mitigation methods. For example, 
increased online connectivity reduces physical encounters, 
minimizing transmission risk while maintaining daily 
routines through telemedicine, online education, and remote 
work [1][3]. Although COVID-19 may temporarily hinder 
development 
plans, 
the 
long-term 
outlook 
remains 
optimistic, as the crisis drives the creation of more intelligent 
and resilient societal systems. The socio-technical system 
improves 
risk 
estimation, 
prediction, 
communication 
efficiency, and risk perception abilities, allowing for better 
understanding of interactions and delays within and among 
systems. 
IV. 
IDENTIFICATION OF MULTI-LEVEL RESILIENCE FACE 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
To gain a deeper understanding of system resilience, we 
conduct an integrated multi-level analysis, including macro-, 
meso-, and micro-levels, to visualize the interrelationships 
and interconnectedness among systems when facing major 
disasters, as shown in Figure 2 (developed based on [1][4] 
[15][23]). This collaborative effort is necessary, as the 
actions taken in one system can have an impact on others in a 
complex adaptive system. In this section, we aim to illustrate 
perceived risk, vulnerability, and societal reactions, as well 
as to discuss the interaction and interconnectedness that 
cascade across different levels, based on the principles of 
systems thinking. 
A. Macro-level Resilience 
Macro-level resilience assesses overall system resilience 
while focusing on the complex interconnected factors that 
shape the systems’ ability to adjust and adapt to traumatic 
events. During emergencies, macro-level resilience takes the 
entire society into consideration, performing the function of 
retrieving resources and redundancy to maintain the major 
functionality of the whole society and sustain society's major 
functionalities in the face of current and future shocks [4]. 
Since the macro layer has access to collect and allocate most 
resources including information and entities, strategic 
accumulation retrieves resourcefulness will continually 
nourish the whole system to have redundancy in crisis 
management. The governance system intervenes from the 
top down to guide the meso-level to formulate more flexible 
and appropriate policies and turn people's behavior towards a 
healthier and more resilient direction to recover from 
emergencies. These effects influence the design and 
implementation of future policies aimed at building a 
sufficient buffer for any national emergencies. This feedback 
may be positive or negative due to the various system 
interactions and interdependencies. Therefore, the macro 
layer provides a framework to guide the sustainability and 
resilience of different systems to maximize the well-being of 
the entire society in the midst of an epidemic. 
B. Meso-level Resilience 
The meso-level of the resilience system serves as a vital 
connection between macro and micro levels, representing 
local organizations and communities with some autonomy. 
This level acts as a strong adhesive and moderator between 
society 
and 
individuals 
[24]. 
Policymaking 
and 
implementation can be time-consuming, and macro-level 
restrictions may not immediately restore societal resilience, 
making 
meso-level 
flexibility 
crucial 
for 
policy 
implementation. In response, the meso-level governance 
system can adapt to local conditions, targeting operational 
robustness and agility to improve resilience for future 
pandemic waves. It cannot be overlooked that a single failure 
or debilitation in one system, or a negative interaction 
between systems, can impair systemic resilience from the 
operational level to the individual level [17]. Resilience at 
the micro level may emerge from the bottom-up, affecting 
the ability to absorb and adapt to threats at meso and macro 
levels. 
Detailed 
and 
flexible 
governance 
enables 
communities and organizations to interpret and implement 
policies based on their situation, promoting local resilience 
and ultimately enhancing the entire social system's resilience 
with the socio-technical system's power to deliver 
information and receive feedback. 
C. Micro-level Resilience 
In addition to the collective approach to systemic 
resilience, individual views and perceptions are also crucial 
in navigating the complexities of the world. The importance 
of individual and family-level resilience cannot be ignored as 
they represent the basic and vulnerable units of society [1]. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the 
mental health and well-being of individuals, exposing their 
vulnerability and substantial risk. Extended self-quarantine, 
canceled social events, and social distancing have all 
significantly affected human well-being [24]. During the 
early stages of the outbreak, widespread rumors caused by 
fear of the unknown also had a detrimental effect on mental 
health [16].  
Individual behavior rapidly adapts and interacts with 
changes in the environment and situation based on the 
information and guidance provided by the macro-level and 
meso-level of society. The socio-technical system collects 
reactions from individuals and provides feedback to the 
governance 
system 
for 
policy 
adjustments 
and 
improvements, promoting resilience from every aspect of 
society [19]. Furthermore, individuals may overcome 
disturbances and adapt their behavior to the changing 
environment in the post-pandemic era through the benefits of 
human-centered design. Matured socio-technical systems 
have 
created 
various 
interaction 
mechanisms 
and 
opportunities to cultivate resilience in individuals.

DEEPER THE ANALYSIS: A RESILIENCE MATRIX 
COVID-19 unlike discrete events such as tornadoes or 
earthquakes, has lasted for years with massive and 
multifaceted interactions among systems. It should be 
recognized as a complex process within time constraints to

Figure 3. Resilience and policymaking matrix during COVID-19 pandemic at different stages 
absorb negative impacts and gradually restore functionalities 
with some newly emergent properties to adapt to changes. 
Various policy combinations can affect resilience at different 
levels and degrees, resulting from interactions across 
different scales of social structure and levels of governance 
[15]. An accountable and reliable governance system can 
minimize the impacts of the pandemic. Inspired by the 
classic resilience curve [2]–[4], this study reviews and 
outlines implemented policies for different resilience stages 
(preparation, disturbance, recovery, transformation) across 
macro-, meso- and micro-levels based on current research on 
resilience and governance to respond to disturbances and 
traumatic 
events, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
3 
[3][14][19][20][22][25]. Examining policy implementations 
from both spatial-temporal dimensions can help stakeholders 
govern the uncertainty and dynamics in a complex world. 
The resilience matrix integrates a range of policies across 
domains such as education, transportation, technology, 
demographics, healthcare, and social norms related to 
society, community, and individual resilience change. 
Policymaking at different levels must take into account 
various time stages, not only focusing on immediate policies 
for immediate results, but also considering long-term 
resilience. The system must accumulate enough adaptability 
and robustness to respond to continuous turmoil, and have 
redundancy and resourcefulness to prevent significant 
functionality loss. The constant intertwining of systems 
combined with policymaking also makes the transformation 
process unpredictable. The system may bounce back to the 
pre-disaster stage with the initial equilibrium, or it may 
become more resilient to transformation with higher levels of 
functionality and creativity. However, some systems may fail 
to recover or require a long time to restore the function [2] 
[25]. Thus, in the post-pandemic era, opportunities and crises 
will coexist, and policymakers must balance short-term and 
long-term considerations to promote resilience at all levels.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, this paper highlights the importance of 
system resilience in disaster management and risk response, 
using a systems thinking approach to examine multi-level 
interactions and feedback. By focusing on system 
interdependencies, we can better identify vulnerabilities and 
strengths, informing policy for various spatial-temporal 
resilience stages. Our study aims to promote cross-sectional 
contributions, enhance societal resilience, and minimize 
functionality loss during crises, such as the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
However, our paper does have some limitations, as we 
could not include detailed case studies to better explain our 
findings due to space limitations. For future research, we 
suggest 
exploring 
the 
impact 
of 
different 
policy 
combinations on resilience across various stages through 
evidence-based studies. As the COVID-19 pandemic offers a 
unique opportunity to assess system resilience performance, 
it provides insights for preparing for future crises.
