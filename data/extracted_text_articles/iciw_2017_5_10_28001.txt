Abstract— The adoption of e-commerce by Spanish companies 
has grown considerably in recent years. Nevertheless, it is still 
far from reaching the levels of other European countries, hence 
the interest in knowing the main features of the Spanish 
companies that have adopted e-commerce. We used the data 
from the Spanish Survey on Business Strategies, and we 
considered 13 variables from the Technology-Organization-
Environment (TOE) model. The temporal scope of the study 
covers the period 2001-2013 and includes 1,770 Spanish 
manufacturing firms and 14,029 firm-year observations. The 
results show that the introduction of e-commerce is 
conditioned 
by 
the 
technological, 
organizational 
and 
environmental contexts. The oldest and largest companies are 
more prone to the implementation of e-commerce. These firms 
have more experience, which allows them to cope with the 
uncertainty implied in an innovation process. Consequently, 
policy measures should be aimed at reducing such uncertainty.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Information and communications technology (ICT) has 
strongly changed the relationship between companies and 
their customers. The enormous progress of technology 
together with the rapid growth of the Internet are key drivers 
to the exponential increase of e-commerce. In Spain, e-
commerce sales exceeded 20,000 million Euros in 2015, 
with annual growth rates above 25% [1]. In 2006, only 
8.02% of Spanish companies made online sales, ten years 
later this figure has grown to 20.14% [2]. Nevertheless, these 
figures are still far from those of other European countries, 
where e-commerce is much more popular. 
The unequal diffusion of e-commerce has traditionally 
been explained by environmental, demographic, economic, 
technological, cultural and legal factors [3]. Previous 
literature confirms the impact of culture and other social 
determinants in the implementation of e-commerce [4][5]. 
Therefore, it is necessary for each country to identify the 
factors that help organizations to implement this kind of 
transactions.  
In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect the 
introduction of Business-to-Consumer (B2C) by Spanish 
manufacturing companies. The identification of these factors 
is very useful as a preliminary step to be able to face the 
difficulties inherent in its adoption. 
The following section contains a review of the previous 
literature on the implementation of e-commerce, which 
serves as a support for the formulation of the research 
hypotheses. The third section develops the empirical study 
with the purpose of contrasting the previous hypotheses. The 
sample used is taken from the Business Strategies Survey 
(ESEE) and covers a 13-year period. Section 4 shows the 
results obtained. Finally, Section 5 lays out the main 
conclusions of this study. 
II. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
There are many theoretical frameworks in the literature 
about the diffusion and adoption of innovations. In this 
paper, we focus on the factors that influence the 
implementation of e-commerce by Spanish manufacturing 
companies and we opted for the Technology-Organization-
Environment (TOE) framework, since it pinpoints the 
perspective of the firm. 
Tornatzky and Fleischer [6] developed the TOE 
framework to explain the factors that influence the behavior 
of organizations in the process of adoption and subsequent 
propagation of an innovation [7]. The TOE framework 
assumes that the adoption process within firms is effectively 
established through the right match between firm’s internal 
and external factors [8]. However, the TOE framework does 
not offer a concrete set of factors that affect technology 
adoption, as it provides taxonomies of factors within their 
respective context where the adoption process takes place 
[9][10]. It contemplates three aspects of a firm's context that 
influence the application of technological innovations: the 
technological context, the organizational context and the 
environmental context. 
The TOE framework has been used by several authors to 
identify factors with incidence in e-business implementation 
[11]-[14]. Once the three contexts are reviewed, the 
corresponding hypotheses are formulated. 
A. Technological context 
The technological context focuses on how structure and 
technological practices can influence the e-commerce 
adoption process. It includes relevant technology for the 
company, both external and internal. The external 
technological context is different between countries, but very 
similar within each country. For example, from the 
technological point of view and dealing with e-commerce, 
52

the support of the law, data security and privacy, the ways to 
address cybercrime concern and online business integrating 
capabilities contribute to the expansion of e-commerce [15] 
and they are the same for a geographical environment. This 
is why the present paper is more focused in internal 
technology. In particular, the following factors are 
considered to be relevant: website availability, investment in 
computer equipment, R&D intensity and the existence of 
previous experience in online purchase. 
The availability of a website in the enterprise interested 
in offering e-commerce to the customers constitutes an 
essential issue. In the case of ICT, the development of well-
structured websites leads to an improvement in the visibility 
of the company and in the attraction of new customers. Some 
authors [16] evidence the importance of website quality for 
the success of e-commerce. Hence, the first hypothesis is 
proposed in the following terms: 
H1a: Firms with their own website are more prone to the 
implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
E-commerce implementation requires computer and 
technological resources. For example, bar code systems, 
automatic inventory replenishment systems, electronic funds 
transfer systems, electronic internet sales interfaces or 
integrated back office storage. This is why the availability of 
these resources facilitates the e-commerce implementation 
[17]. Therefore, we formulate the following hypothesis: 
H1b: Firms with greater investment in computer 
equipment are more prone to the implementation of B2C e-
commerce. 
There 
is 
a circular relationship between 
R&D 
investments and profitability. Investment in knowledge and 
in R&D may expand the technological opportunities; the 
increased knowledge endowment in turn enhances the 
profitability of entrepreneurial activity by facilitating 
recognition and exploitation of new business opportunities 
[18] as, for example, e-commerce. Therefore, innovative 
companies have more chances of success in online business. 
Hence, we hypothesize that: 
H1c: Firms with a greater effort in R&D activities are 
more prone to the implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
Trust is a key pillar in e-commerce. Uncertainty is both 
one of the most important inhibitory factors when deciding 
its implementation, and a source of difficulties for companies 
with their e-commerce initiatives [19]. So, it is necessary for 
firms to reduce the uncertainty associated with the 
introduction of e-business. Therefore, previous experience in 
e-commerce activities as a buyer can be a positive factor for 
the B2C implementation. Hence, the following hypothesis is 
formulated: 
H1d: Firms with previous experience in purchasing 
through the internet are more prone to the implementation of 
B2C e-commerce. 
B. Organizational context 
The organizational context includes attributes of the firm 
that can facilitate or limit the adoption of innovations. After 
reviewing the literature, the most relevant factors of the 
organizational context were considered: size, previous 
experience, separation between ownership and control, 
product 
diversification, 
internationalization, 
operating 
margin and foreign capital. 
The size of the enterprise is an explanatory variable 
widely used for several motives. First, the risk of failure is 
greater in small and medium-sized enterprises than in large 
enterprises [20]. Secondly, larger companies are able to 
allocate more resources and capital to face the expenses 
involved in the adoption [21]. Thirdly, larger firms are able 
to reduce the adoption costs through economies of scale [22]. 
Therefore, a number of prior papers evidenced the positive 
relationship between firm size and the adoption of e-
commerce [23][24]. However, other studies do not observe 
such a relationship [25][26]. The reason may be that, unlike 
other ICT applications, e-commerce could not require large 
investments, making it accessible even for small and 
medium-sized enterprises. In the present paper, the 
arguments in favor of the first relationship are considered 
more important, so the following hypothesis is formulated: 
H2a: Big firms are more prone to the implementation of 
B2C e-commerce. 
As time goes by, firms are able to accumulate resources, 
managerial knowledge and the ability to handle uncertainty 
[27]. In addition, mature firms enhance their reputation and 
position in the market [28]. Finally, there is evidence about 
the positive effect of firm age on innovative outcomes [29]. 
Hence, we hypothesize that: 
H2b: Oldest firms are more prone to the implementation 
of B2C e-commerce. 
Another key factor in the e-commerce adoption is the top 
management support. The managers’ commitment has 
positive effects throughout the organization, since it allows 
acquiring greater awareness of the advantages of technology, 
reinforces the links with the infrastructure required for its 
implementation and facilitates the training necessary for the 
use of the technology [30]. Therefore, to the extent that 
management is professionalized, the commitment with the 
implementation of e-commerce could be strengthened. 
Hence, the following hypothesis is formulated: 
H2c: Firms with separation of ownership and control are 
more prone to the implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
Companies that make less diversified products rely on 
economies of scale to minimize their costs. Therefore, they 
seek to sell large volumes of products to a small number of 
customers. On the other hand, firms with a greater 
diversification of products try to reach a large number of 
customers, so e-commerce is considered a very suitable 
strategy for them. Hence, the following hypothesis is 
formulated: 
H2d: Firms with greater product diversification are more 
prone to the implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
Another variable that may influence the e-commerce 
implementation is whether the firm develops its activity in 
international markets or not. The empirical literature on 
technological innovations shows a positive relationship 
between 
exports 
and 
innovation 
[31], 
because 
internationalization implies growth in competitiveness and 
market size. ICT reduce the impact of geographical locations 
and distances [32]. E-commerce offers companies a new way 
of reaching consumers without physical establishments, so it 
53

ICIW 2017 : The Twelfth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

has been recognized as an important facilitator of 
international expansion [33]. Hence, we hypothesize that: 
H2e: The most internationalized firms are more prone to 
the implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
The link between profitability and adoption of new 
technologies has been studied in the literature. Higher-
performing firms are more likely to adopt ICT because of 
their greater availability of resources. For example, some 
authors [34] conclude that high-performing banks adopt 
product and process innovations more regularly than low-
performing banks. For this reason, in the case of e-
commerce, the following hypothesis is formulated: 
H2f: Firms with high profitability are more prone to the 
implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
Most of the reasons cited in the literature support a 
positive relationship between multinational ownership and 
ICT adoption. This is because firms forming part of a group 
are able to reduce the risk involved in the adoption of new 
technologies [35]. The existence of an external network 
plays a substantial role in the adoption process, since 
networking heightens the awareness of the innovation and 
increases the likelihood of its adoption [36]. The literature 
has found empirical evidence to support this positive 
relationship [32]. Therefore, the hypothesis formulated is: 
H2g: Firms with greater presence of foreign capital are 
more prone to the implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
C. Environmental context 
The environmental context is based on the fact that the 
company is surrounded by multiple stakeholders (customers, 
suppliers, competitors, government, financial institutions, 
society and many more), that have decisive influence, among 
other aspects, on the need to innovate, the ability to obtain 
resources for innovation and the ability to make the most of 
them [6]. Regarding ICT implementation, the environment 
within which the firm performs its activities and the pressure 
of the stakeholders play an important role [11][37]. The 
environmental factor has also been called the institutional 
factor [14] or external pressure [38]. The Institutional Theory 
[39] points out the influence of environmental variables in 
companies’ decisions, one of them being whether to 
implement e-commerce. 
In the present paper, one variable regarding the 
environment of the firm is considered; it is customer 
concentration. 
The greater the number of customers, the greater the 
advantages of implementing e-commerce, since the fixed 
costs caused by its implementation could be distributed 
among more users. In addition, online business allows to 
reach a greater number of potential customers. Hence, we 
hypothesize that: 
H3a: Firms with greater number of customers are more 
prone to the implementation of B2C e-commerce. 
Finally, industry in which the firm operates may have an 
important influence on the e-commerce adoption. This 
variable reflects business environment factors, such as 
heterogeneity and uncertainty. Firms in different industries 
have to deal with different types of business environment 
dynamics, which may affect e-commerce adoption [40]. The 
strategic value of e-commerce seems to be different 
depending on the sector. That is to say, it becomes a 
competitive necessity in those industries where competition 
is very aggressive and competitors are making intensive use 
of it [41]. Therefore, in this paper the industry ascription was 
used as a control variable. 
The proposed model is shown graphically in Figure 1.  
III. 
EMPIRICAL STUDY 
To contrast the formulated hypotheses, an empirical 
analysis is carried out on a sample of Spanish manufacturing 
companies. This section exposes the formation of the 
database, the variables used, the main descriptive statistics of 
the sample and the methodology used for hypotheses testing. 
A. Database 
To carry out the empirical study we used the Survey on 
Business 
Strategies 
(Encuesta 
sobre 
Estrategias 
Empresariales - ESEE), elaborated by the Spanish Ministry 
of Science and Technology. This survey is one of the most 
representative databases of Spanish companies, since ESEE 
is a reliable source for information on the strategies of 
Spanish companies. The reference population of the ESEE is 
constituted by the Spanish manufacturing companies with 10 
or more employees. 
In the present study, the period between 2001 and 2013 
was taken as temporal scope. After eliminating the 
companies for which information was not available, we 
formed a database comprising 1,770 companies. 
B. Variables in the analysis 
Taking into account the theoretical development and the 
hypotheses formulation, we considered a number of 
variables for our analysis. These variables are displayed in 
Table I. Moreover, twenty dummy variables were considered 
for the industry in which firm operates.

D. Empirical Methods 
Random effects Logit panel-data estimations were used. 
The STATA 13.1 software package was used. The dependent 
variable is web-b2c, a dichotomous one, which equals 1 if 
the company makes sales to individual customers through 
the Internet and 0 otherwise. The independent variables are 
age, owner_control, sales, margin, con_conc, diversif, 
for_cap, 
invcom, 
ownserver, 
intpurchases, 
rd_sales, 
export_sales, and the dummy variables indicating the sector 
ascription (In order to avoid perfect collinearity we dropped 
the largest sector). 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Table IV contains the results of the panel logit regression 
estimation. We display the coefficients and their standard 
errors, as well as the z statistics and the corresponding p-
values. We also include some additional statistics (Log 
likelihood and the corresponding test, and the ρ test on the 
significance of the panel variance). 
The analysis of the ρ-statistic reveals that the panel-level 
variance is significant. Therefore, the use of a panel data 
approach is justified. Furthermore, the likelihood ratio test 
evidences the joint significance of the set of independent 
variables. With regard to the results for each one of the 
proposed indicators, the following results are obtained: 
• Our data provide evidence to support H1a, H1d, H2a, and 
H2b. This implies that older and larger companies are 
more prone to the implementation of e-commerce. In 
addition, companies that have their own servers to host 
their websites and those who had previous experience in 
making purchases online are also more prone to the 
implementation of e-commerce. 
• The results show that the higher the consumers’ 
concentration, the less the propensity to implement e-
commerce, and thus H3a is confirmed. In addition, the 
companies that invest the most in computer equipment 
are less likely to implement e-commerce.

This is the opposite of what we hypothesized (H1b). As 
reasons for this, it is possible to point out that the 
implementation of this innovation requires, rather than an 
investment in physical equipment, the development of 
software projects, and companies that are forced to 
renew/expand their hardware may no longer have 
available 
resources 
to 
purchase/develop 
software 
products. This is because all these investments usually 
belong to the common chapter of technological 
investments within the company budget. 
• For the other independent variables there seems to be no 
influence.  
The results show the influence of factors belonging to the 
three contexts identified by the TOE framework in the e-
commerce implementation. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Despite the positive effects of the adoption of e-
commerce, a considerable number of Spanish companies 
have not yet implemented it. This situation differs from what 
happens in other European countries, where rates of use of e-
commerce are much higher. This justifies the interest in 
knowing the characteristic factors of the companies that have 
adopted e-commerce. 
The results obtained reveal the positive influence in the 
implementation of e-commerce of two relevant factors, 
which belong to the organizational context of the company: 
size and age. It seems clear that older and larger companies 
are perceived by consumers as more trustworthy and less 
risky, and this leads this kind of firms to implement e-
commerce. Indeed, trust is considered a key factor for the 
success of e-commerce. This perception may move older and 
larger companies to implement e-commerce. 
Two variables from the business technological context 
(whether the company makes purchases through the Internet, 
whether it has its own servers to host its website), are also 
shown as determining factors for the implementation of e-
commerce.  
Finally, as regards the environmental context, the 
evidence obtained supports that the dispersion of customers 
has an influence on the implementation of e-commerce. 
It should be noted that the introduction of e-commerce is 
conditioned by the technological context, the organizational 
context and the environmental context of the company. This 
means that in order to increase the implementation rates, it is 
necessary to act on the three contexts at the same time. The 
results obtained show that the main measure to be taken is to 
reduce the uncertainty that any innovation process entails. 
Because of such uncertainty, the larger and the older (more 
experienced) companies are in better position for the 
implementation. However, the contagion effect that these 
companies exert on the others in any area makes more and 
more companies betting on it. 
Finally, as future lines of research to develop the present 
paper, we propose to analyze the reasons why many 
companies still do not use e-commerce, even though the 
number decreases progressively over time. It should also be 
interesting to determine why some of the factors that were 
proven relevant in prior research conducted at the 
international level (ownership-control separation, margin, 
diversification, foreign capital, R&D intensity and exports) 
are not relevant for the Spanish case.
