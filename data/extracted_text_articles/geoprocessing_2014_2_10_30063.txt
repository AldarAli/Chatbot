Abstract — This work is based on an analysis of the main 
components derived from particular patterns of spatial 
statistical data. The reference models of spatial statistical 
analysis are extracted only from the data of bi-temporal aerial 
photographs. This methodological approach introduces a 
significant improvement in the evaluation of changes in the 
territorial scenery, providing a wider interpretation of the 
problems of the area studied and encouraging a more 
analytical reading of complex environmental phenomena. In 
order to improve reading and analysis of the territorial 
changes it is necessary to compare the same geographical space 
in two different moments that enclose a well-defined period of 
time. 
Keywords – GIS; cartography; spatial data analysis; spatial 
statistical model.

 INTRODUCTION 
The techniques of analysis of multi-temporal remote sensing 
images are currently based on the recognition of the 
diversity of spectral indices of the two images observed. 
This methodology is applied by using software products that 
classify the content of the images. This classification is 
based on the similarity of the local spectral radiance. 
Classes of pixels are classified by evaluating the evolution 
of the state, from beginning to end [1]. The classification is 
made on the basis of spectral responses of the surfaces, 
based on the concept of similarity between pixels. This 
clustering is applied to the pixels of each image. This 
methodology requires the definition of prototypes based on 
a comparison of a minimum set of pixels representative of 
the class. There are basically two different methods for 
automatic classification of digital images [2]: 
 
Supervised Classification: this is used for a 
quantitative analysis of remote sensing images. This 
methodology can be summarized in two phases. The 
first phase provides a definition of the legend 
specifying the set of cover. The second phase 
provides an identification of the spectral signature on 
the ground. These two phases are useful for providing 
information on the software used to carry out the 
classification of the area [3][4]. 
 
Unsupervised Classification: this uses the concept 
that produces similar spectral responses. A specific 
knowledge about the extent, type, and class 
descriptions is not required with these systems. These 
properties are based on observations of clusters 
formed in the spatial features. The main peculiarity is 
that the classes are identified by cluster compact and 
it is easy to distinguish between them. These clusters 
do not require knowledge of the features or of their 
nature. The entire space is split into spectral classes 
according to criteria of proximity or similarity. Only 
after the process of identification of spectral classes is 
finished, will the analyst associate these properties in 
relation to the knowledge of the territory [5]. 
In this paper, we propose a method that belongs to the 
techniques of unsupervised classification. With each cluster, 
in addition to the spectral properties, proximity and 
similarity, there are also recognized: perimeter, area, their 
relationship, their moments of inertia Jx and Jy, etc. Each 
cluster extracted from the digital image is described by its 
radiometric, geometric, and inertial properties, which are 
stored in a database. Applying the principal component 
method [9] to clusters extracted from digital images and 
described by their properties, as mentioned above allows us 
to identify, for each of the new factorial axes, similar classes 
of cluster characterized predominantly by only variables that 
have a high correlation value (factor loadings) between 
variable and factor.  
The clusters, in the new reference by each main 
component, retain the property of having an average equal to 
0 and variance equal to 1. The graphic rendering, for each 
main component of the clusters of positive coordinates, 
allows the segmentation of the original image. This shows 
classes of clusters that often are not detectable in the original 
image; therefore, the comparison between the segments of 
multi-temporal images obtained in this manner is facilitated 
and more readily available. 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we 
illustrate the location of the study area, the material used, the 
organization of the digital data collection and preparation of 
digital data. In Section 3, we describe the method for the 
analysis of the data. In Section 4, we describe the type of 
statistical analysis used. In Section 5, we propose the data 
model used for the analysis, we provide examples in order to

show our proposal. Finally, in Section 6, the discussion and 
conclusion are given. 
II. 
DATA ORGANIZATION 
The area of study is located in the south of Italy, in the 
province of Taranto, and is located in the northern Gulf of 
Taranto within the first basin of the Little Sea within which 
flows the river Galeso.  
The material used for the analysis of this data is in raster 
digital format, with reference to an aerial photo of the 
Military Geographical Institute of 1940. The analyses were 
made available in digital format thanks to the collaboration 
of 
the 
Laboratory 
of 
ancient 
topography 
and 
photogrammetry of the University of Salento. The 
Geoportal's Web Map Service (WMS) of the Campania 
Region, which has kindly allowed us to use the orthophotos 
of the same site obnserved in 2010, as well as a portion of a 
topographic map in scale 1:10.000, used for georeferencing 
of both aerial photos. 
The raster digital format was acquired through a 
photogrammetric scanner; georeferencing [6][7], was then 
used. The system used is the Universal Transverse Mercator 
(UTM) - European Datum 1950 (ED50). 
The georeferencing of the Regional Technical Map 
requires a value of Root Mean Square (RMS); the graphics 
below show the graphical representation error with respect to 
the scale representation (1:10000 scale is 0.2 mm, 2 meters 
in real scale) [6][7].  
This technique allows us to identify homologous points 
in the aerial photo for the georeferencing of the same space, 
without resorting to tools of GPS positioning, in order to 
detect in situ. In this way we obtain a minimum margin of 
error for the measurements of the spatial analysis for the case 
study. 
The recognition of homologous points between technical 
mapping and aerial photo requires an accuracy for the 
identification of the exact location and a good distribution of 
support points; in this scenario, five control points are 
identified, which gave good results for a correct 
georeferencing of the aerial photo. 
The transform algorithm applied to the matrix is of the 
type polynomial affine [6]. 
The recognition of homologous points in the aerial photo 
of 1940 is more difficult, since the change in territory does 
not permit an easy identification of common elements with 
aerial photos of the Military Geographical Institute. 
In this case, we first identify large objects such as the 
geomorphological aspects, then small elements, for example, 
buildings and any other element which allows a good 
distribution of the points of support for the application of the 
georeferencing method. 
The picture of 1940 is not a calibrated aerial photo and 
therefore the picture is distorted and requires an appropriate 
transformation. A transformation involves a mapping of 
locations of points in one image to new locations in another. 
Image Transformations used to align two images may be 
global or local. A global transformation is given by a single 
equation which maps the entire image. Examples are the 
affine, 
projective, 
perspective, 
and 
polynomial 
transformations. Local transformations map the image 
differently depending on the spatial location and are thus 
much more difficult to express succinctly. In the image of 
1940 a local transformation was used [6]. 
The Pixels of the aerial photos positioned in their correct 
geographic space have been a simply of the nearest/neighbor 
interpolation. 
III. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
The two orthophotos from Figure 1 and 2 show the 
Northern arc of the first Sinus of the Mar Piccolo, into which 
flows the river Galeso, dating back to 1940 and 2010, 
respectively.  
An initial examination of comparative urbanization can 
be seen in this frame of 2010, which mainly affected the 
western arc of the first Sinus of the Mar Piccolo. Variations 
seem to be able to detect an industrial plant related to 
“Cantieri Navali”, located north of the Sinus, and then, along 
the course of the river that flows near Galeso, the same 
shipyards that are no longer used. 
Our curiosity extended far beyond a first visual 
comparison of the two images from which you can detect, 
even with the naked eye, the profound changes that occurred 
over a period of seventy years, especially in the first western 
Sinus of the Mar Piccolo.

We, therefore, subjected the two images, in view of their 
automated processing, with a scanning step of 20 microns, 
obtaining their digitization by a mosaic in which each tile 
was represented by its coordinates x, y and by the value of 8 
bits of its gray level. 
For each image, the mosaic thus obtained, we proceeded 
with an automatic extraction of “patch” with the criterion of 
“similarity” between tiles assigned to satisfying the criteria 
of closeness and proximity of the relative levels of gray.  
 “Patch” in ecology means the structural unit of an 
environmental system heterogeneous, identified on the basis 
on the differences that appear within the area itself. 
We have thus converted each image into a set of 
“patches” each of which were calculated fifteen numeric 
attributes related to the geometric properties of the patch 
(perimeter, delta-X and delta-Y, area, etc.) and others to its 
inertial properties ( Jx, Jy, Rx, Ry, etc.). 
From the image of 1940 were extracted 341 patches, 
whereas 438 will be extracted from the image of 2010, about 
a third more of the patches contained in the image of 1940. 
This first result shows how the environment has increased 
the fragmentation of the examined area. 
The two analog images, when converted into two distinct 
sets of patches, each characterized by fifteen attributes, were 
subjected to a factor analysis procedure with the method of 
principal components (Hotelling) [8][9][11]. 
The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a linear 
transformation that transforms the data into a new coordinate 
system; the new set of variables, the principal components, 
are linear functions of the original variables and are 
uncorrelated. The greatest variance by any projection of the 
data comes to lie on the first coordinate, the second greatest 
variance on the second coordinate, and so on. In practice, 
this is achieved by computing the covariance matrix for the 
full data set. Next, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the 
covariance matrix are computed, and sorted according to 
decreasing eigenvalue. One can see that the PCA's bias is not 
always appropriate; features with low variance might 
actually have high predictive relevance; this depends on the 
application [10]. 
Given a set of p observations for each variable of a 
complex of m variables, the principal component analysis is 
proposed to determine new variables linearly related with the 
given variables, but in a lesser number of these latter, so that 
we can represent the variability expressed by the original 
variables. If it is not possible to meet these conditions, it is 
not possible, to represent the variability of the original 
variables with less than m, t and he principal component 
analysis is limited to an acceptable extent represent the 
majority of this variability with less than m variables. The 
problem of the analysis of the components is therefore 
related to the reduction of the number of descriptive 
variables m of p objects, regardless of the ability to identify 
new variables; Such identification must be decided in each 
particular case, generally, without any reference to the 
statistics, and in the field of the phenomena involved in the 
study [12][13]. 
IV. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 The evaluation of the variance between the two aerial 
photos examined is based on the classification of patches 
extracted and subjected to statistical methodology of the 
analysis of the main components (Hotelling). The principal 
component analysis is a multivariate statistical technique that 
explains the variability of a statistical variable in k 
dimensions Z=(Z1,Z2, …, Zk) in terms of k variables 
Y1,Y2,…Yk, linear combinations of the Z j. It has: 
 
 
 
Yi = ∑j bij
 Zj (i=1,2,…,k) 
(1) 
 
where bij are constants to be determined. Yi are called the 
main components of the variable Z and assuming they are 
not related to each other ordered by importance, in the 
explanation of the variability of Z we have:  
 
 
cov(Yi,Yj)=0  (i ≠ j) 
(2) 
 
 
 
V(Y1) ≥ V(Y2) ≥ … ≥V(Yk) 
(3) 
 
where cov is covariance and V is variance. Without loss of 
generality we can assume that the variables Zi are 
standardized, with mean equal to 0 and variance equal to 1, 
so as to eliminate the influence of the origin and the unit of 
measurement data, so that it results the following 
expression: 
 
 
Z j = (X j – μj)/ϭj 
(4) 
 
 
Also, impose the condition that the overall variance of Zj is 
equal to that of Yi, i.e.: 
 
 
 
Σi V(Yi) = Σi V(Zi) = k 
(5) 
  
 
At last, suppose that the vectors 
 
 
 
b i = (bi,1, bi,2,…, bi,k)  
(6) 
 
 
have unit length, i.e., they fulfill the condition: 
 
 
 
Σj b2 ij = 1 (i=1,2,…, k)  
(7) 
 
 
On account of this, the vectors bi that maximize the variance 
of Y1, of Y2, …, to Yk with the constraints (3) and (4), are 
the eigenvectors of the matrix C of the coefficients of 
correlation between the variables Zj, which correspond to

the eigenvalues λ1, λ2,…, λk of C, sorted by non-increasing 
value. We then have: 
 
 
|C - λI | = 0 
(8) 
 
 
b i (C - λi I) = 0 
(9) 
 
where I is the unit matrix. The matrix C is symmetric and 
positive definite for which the solutions λi of the (8) are 
non-negative and such that their sum (trace of the matrix C) 
is equal to k. We then have: 
 
 
 Σi λi = k  (i=1,2,…, k)  
(10) 
  
 
The variance of the i-th component is: 
 
 
 
V(Yi ) = λi 
(11) 
 
 
And the contribution of Yi to the overall variance is: 
 
 
 
Pi = V(Yi ) / k = λi / k 
(12) 
  
V. 
SPATIAL STATISTICAL MODELS 
This procedure allowed us to calculate the correlation 
coefficients between the 15 variables adopted to describe 
each patch, with the aim of drastically reducing the number 
of variables, thereby explaining the overall variability of the 
system with a smaller number of attributes, each of which 
appears to be a linear combination of the attributes of 
departure.

By using the factor analysis of the first array of data - 
about the image of 1940 – there emerged five factors that 
explained 96% of the total variance of the system. Of these 
five factors, the first alone explained 49% of the variance 
while the other four factors explained, neatly, 22%, 13%, 7% 
and 5%. 
Table II reports the values of composition of each factor 
in function of the original variables. The weights of the 
variables were calculated on each factor (factor loadings).  
These weights may also be interpreted as the correlation 
coefficients between variable and factor.

We reduced the size of the area of the patch definition, 
the image of 1940, from 15 to 5, after which we 
reconstructed the images with the new standardized patch 
values greater than average, that is greater than zero - based 
on each major component. These are illustrated in Figure 3, 
Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7.

Similarly, we proceeded to the WMS image taken in 
2010. From this processing four main components (or 
factors) emerged that explained 90% of the overall variance 
of the system of the 438 patch (each described by 15 
variables ), while the first factor explained only 52% of the 
overall variance, the second factor 24%, 8% on the third, and 
the fourth 6%. 
It can take the following list of factors emerged 
according to the percentage of variance explained: 50% = 
excellent, 40% = very good, 30% = good, 20% = sufficient, 
10% = poor, <= 10% by ignore [15][16].

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
Factor analysis applied, as has been described, the first 
two images of the Sinus of the Mar Piccolo, respectively in 
the aerial photo of the Military Geographical Institute that 
dates back to 1940 and the aerial photo of the Web Map 
Service (WMS) in 2010, has enabled us to obtain the 
decomposition of the two analog images into layers that 
describe numerically the evolutionary peculiarities of the 
area examined. When considering only the main components 
characterized by an explanatory contribution to the overall 
variance of the system more than 10%, it can be seen that the 
landscape of the first Sinus of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto has 
suffered fragmentation from 1940 to 2010, a fact that is 
evidenced by an increase in patches extracted from each of 
the images taken between 1940 and 2010. In addition, the 
composition of the loading factors between variables and 
factors remains generally unchanged between 1940 and 
2010, which is meant to signify that there was not a material 
change in the landscape between 1940 and 2010, with the 
exception of the arc, where western coastal residential 
developments grew on significant extensions of territory. It 
is very interesting to note the comparison of the image 
reconstructed with the first principal component orthophoto 
of 1940, (see Figure 3), and the reconstructed image with the 
fourth main component of the image of the Web Map 
Service (WMS) 2010 (see Figure 11). Both of these digital 
images, obtained from the analysis of the main components, 
seem to indicate what was a significant numerical evolution 
of the body of water in the first Sinus of the Mar Piccolo 
between 1940 and 2010. Perhaps it would also be useful to 
search for physical causes of this evolution.
