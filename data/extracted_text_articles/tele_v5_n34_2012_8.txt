Abstract—The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is 
one of the widely used modulation techniques in the present 
broadband wireless technology. The opportunities and 
challenges of this modulation technique are derived from its 
native advantages and disadvantages. One of the main 
problems is the high peak-to-average power ratio of 
transmission signal due to the superposition of many 
subcarriers. In previous works, various hybrid peak-to-
average power ratio reduction techniques were presented. One 
of these techniques was the combination of the standard active 
constellation extension with the sequential tone reservation 
scheme. This paper presents a new hybrid peak-to-average 
power ratio reduction technique, which combines other active 
constellation extension and tone reservation schemes. This is 
the case of already known smart gradient projection and new 
proposed signal compression gradual projection active 
constellation extension and sequential block ordered tone 
reservation scheme respectively. The simulations shown that 
the proposed technique realizes an increased peak-to-average 
power ratio reduction compared to component methods with 
similar parameters.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(OFDM) is one of the most efficient and popular modulation 
techniques used in broadband wireless communication 
systems like Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access (WiMAX), Terrestrial Digital Video Broadcast 
(DVB-T), or wireline systems like Asymmetric Digital 
Subscriber Line (ADSL). One of the main practical issues of 
the OFDM is the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of 
the transmitted signal. This high PAPR occurs because of the 
time-domain superposition of the many data subcarriers 
which compose the OFDM signal. Due to the large number 
of subcarriers, the resulting time-domain signal exhibits 
Rayleigh-like 
characteristics 
and 
large 
time-domain 
amplitude variations. These large signal peaks require the 
high power amplifiers (HPA) to support wide linear dynamic 
range. 
Higher signal level causes non-linear distortions leading 
to an inefficient operation of HPA, causing intermodulation 
products resulting unwanted out-of-band power. In order to 
reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals, many solutions have 
been proposed and analyzed. For an enhanced PAPR 
reduction, hybrid techniques were proposed [1]-[6] as well. 
The efficiency of these methods can be evaluated 
considering their characteristics of non-linearity, amount of 
processing and size of side information needed to be sent to 
receiver.  
The class of linear methods is represented by approaches 
like selective mapping (SLM) [7], Partial Transmit Sequence 
(PTS) [8], and Tone Reservation (TR) [9]. 
The SLM method generates several signal replicas based 
on a set of predefined phase patterns. The algorithm 
performs vector rotations of each subcarrier from the original 
frequency domain OFDM signal. For each obtained signal 
variant, the corresponding PAPR is evaluated. The variant 
with the lowest PAPR is chosen for the transmission. A 
similar approach is applied in case of PTS method, where the 
same rotating phase is applied to a group of subcarriers.  
Both methods provide a variable efficiency of PAPR 
reduction, being dependent by the considered number of 
angles and phase patterns. An important disadvantage of 
these methods is that an extended set of different phase 
patterns leads to an increased computation complexity.  To 
overcome this problem, additional information can be sent to 
the receiver, in order to reduce its required search space. This 
approach presents another disadvantage due to reduced 
payload of each OFDM frame.  
Optimizations of these methods have been proposed in 
several works [10][11]. 
Another PAPR reduction method is TR, which uses a set 
of reserved set of subcarriers (tones) to generate signals with 
lower PAPR level. Besides the advantage of no additional 
distortion, this method also does not need to transmit 
additional information to the receiver. Because not all 
subcarriers are used to transmit useful information, this 
method is considered to lower the data rate of the OFDM-
based systems. 
Since the development of the original TR method, in 
order to reduce the computation complexity and to improve

the performance, several derivate techniques have been 
proposed: selective mapping of partial tones (SMOPT) [12], 
One-Tone One-Peak (OTOP) [13] and one-by-one iteration 
[14]. 
Another optimized variant of this method proposes to 
generate tones for the K largest peaks of the signal. The 
phases of these tones are chosen to be opposite to φj+nπ/2, 
where φj is the phase of the identified peaks, j=1, 2, …, K 
and n=0, 1, 2, 3. The procedure is iterated until convergence 
reaches the expected threshold [9]. 
The class of non-linear methods is represented by 
approaches like active constellation extension (ACE), 
clipping, partial clipping, and signal compression. 
The ACE method change the original OFDM signal by 
modifying amplitude and phase of tones whose base band 
modulation symbol is an outer point of the constellation. 
Those 
outer 
signaling 
points 
of 
the 
conventional 
constellation are dynamically moved toward outside of the 
original constellation in order to obtain signal derivates with 
reduced PAPR level for the transmitter. The domain for 
allowed alternative points is chosen so that the signal 
processing does not reduce the constellation’s minimum-
distance but lowers the PAPR level [15][16]. 
For additional PAPR reduction, some proposed derivate 
methods consider outers points projection onto squares or 
circles around all the QAM constellation points and 
intentional distortion within the allowed bounds. The 
tradeoff between level of the constellation distortion and 
PAPR level is analyzed and optimized as well [17]. 
The clipping method is another well known non-linear 
PAPR reduction technique, where the amplitude of the signal 
is limited to a given threshold. Because interpolation may 
generate peak regrowth, different filtering techniques have 
been proposed. Filtering can also cause peak regrowth, but 
less than the clipping before interpolation [18]. 
Another 
clipping 
technique 
supposes 
that 
only 
subcarriers having the highest phase difference between the 
original signal and its clipped variant will be changed. This 
is the case of the partial clipping (PC) method [19]. 
Other group of nonlinear methods is represented by 
signal companding, originally developed for audio signal 
compression. These methods are implemented as a digital 
nonlinear attenuator, which operates at the transmitter before 
the HPA device.  
Some works proposed µ-law or A-law companding 
functions [20] or exponential companding function [21]. In 
order to reduce the computation complexity, other 
companding method uses transfer functions split in linear 
sub-domains with different coefficients. This is the case of 
the piecewise-scales method [22]. In order to decrease the 
computation complexity without using sub-domains, other 
methods consider polynomial ratio functions [23].   
At the receiver, the inverse function for signal expanding 
is applied. This is implemented as a nonlinear amplifier 
which performs the reverse operation over the time-domain 
signal. Therefore the nonlinearity does not alter the signal 
reconstruction process, but has an important impact over the 
received noise from the communication channel. Therefore 
the BER performance is strongly impacted by the obtained 
noise after the signal expanding block. 
For an optimized balance between PAPR reduction level 
and BER degradation, other methods consider adaptive 
quasi-nonlinear sigmoid transfer functions [6]. 
For additional PAPR reduction, different hybrid 
techniques were proposed as well. Their efficiency depends 
by the characteristics and types of the component methods.  
Combinations of a linear method with a non-linear 
method present better PAPR reduction with moderate 
increase of computation complexity, and average BER 
degradation [2][3]. Also, combination of two linear methods, 
one operating on the data subcarriers and the other one 
operating on the non-data subcarriers, presents improved 
efficiency of PAPR reduction [4].  
An important characteristic of these combinations is that 
their computation complexity depends by the cumulative set 
of parameters describing the total amount of operations 
required by the component methods. 
Additional to previous work [1], the present paper 
considers as ACE derivates, the well known smart gradient 
projection 
(SGP) 
method 
and 
proposes 
the 
signal 
compression based gradual projection (CGP) method. Also 
the present paper, proposes a new TR derivate based on the 
sequential block grouping (SBG) method.   
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second 
section describes the proposed hybrid PAPR reduction 
scheme, when various ACE and TR derivates are applied. In 
the third section is described the clipping method as PAPR 
reduction method of reference. Next, in the forth section, the 
simulation results for various ACE-TR combinations, 
highlighted by the computer simulation, are presented and 
discussed. The PAPR reduction efficiency is evaluated when 
the new gradual projection ACE and the new sequential 
block grouping TR schemes are applied. Based on the 
obtained results, some conclusions are presented in the fifth 
section. 
II. 
THE HYBRID METHOD 
The proposed hybrid PAPR reduction technique is 
obtained by serialization of a gradual projection active 
constellation extension method and sequential tone 
reservation method. 
The main idea for combining the two methods is relying 
on the observation that the cumulative signal processing for 
PAPR reduction will increase the overall performance. 
Furthermore, the idea is based on the fact that each of the 
considered methods is based on a different principle. One 
performs a controlled signal distortion and the other realizes 
different changes of the non-data subcarriers [1]. 
The block diagram of the proposed method is presented 
in Figure 1. The performance of the proposed PAPR 
reduction technique is analyzed with a MATLAB simulator 
as presented in Figure 2. For this purpose, within this 
simulator, the samples from the uniformly distributed 
random generated signal are mapped from binary 
representation to the M-QAM or M-PSK constellation 
points. The obtained complex values are grouped in blocks 
of N elements each, forming the OFDM symbols.

The obtained OFDM frames are applied to the PAPR 
reduction 
blocks. 
This 
signal 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) 
block for the evaluation of the PAPR reduction. Next, the 
resulted signal is applied to the communication channel 
represented by the complex additive white Gaussian noise. 
This channel is composed by two independent random 
Gaussian generated sequences, representing the real and 
imaginary components of the complex additive noise.  
Next, the samples of the noised signal are applied to the 
demodulator block and M-QAM or M-PSK demapper. 
Based on the comparison of the obtained received data 
samples with the initial generated samples, the bit error rate 
(BER) performance is evaluated. 
For a better performance comparison, besides the 
proposed ACE-TR method, additionally the clipping 
method [18] is taken into consideration. The PAPR 
reduction blocks alter the original signal. Due to this fact, 
for evaluation of communication’s performance and 
efficiency, besides the CCDF and BER characteristics, the 
simulator estimates the power spectral density (PSD) for the 
signal obtained after processing for PAPR reduction. 
The expression of the PAPR for a given OFDM signal 
block is given by:

Within the next paragraphs, the considered ACE and TR 
methods are described. 
A. The ACE method 
The ACE method requires both time-domain and 
frequency-domain signal processing. As already mentioned, 
the main idea of this method is to shift the outer 
constellation points toward exterior of original constellation 
generating an alternative representation of the same symbol.  
The allowed domains for these outer points are presented in 
Figure 3, when 16-QAM is used as digital modulation. 
The boundaries of these domains are constrained by the 
constellation’s minimum-distance. The reason for this 
limitation is to prevent a decrease of BER performance at 
the receiver. 
In the previous work [1], the considered ACE method 
was implemented with the projection onto convex sets 
(POCS) scheme, where ACE constraints are applied after 
clipping, according with the algorithm presented in [15]. 
In the preset work, two more ACE derivate methods are 
considered: one is the SGP-ACE and the other one is the 
new CGP-ACE proposed method. These methods perform 
gradual projection, as described in the next paragraphs. 
The SGP-ACE method uses a gradient-projection 
approach, where only a part of the clipping difference is 
applied to the original time-domain signal. At each iteration,

the ACE constraints are applied in order to ensure that only 
allowable extension vectors are changed [15]. 
The implementation of this ACE method requires the 
following steps: 
1) Get an OFDM frame with N subcarriers, represented by 
the frequency-domain signal Xo. 
2) Compute the corresponding time-domain signal x[n], by 
use of IFFT function.

15) Repeat the procedure according with the given number 
of cycles, considering the previously obtained time-domain 
signal as input data for the presented algorithm. 
After some iterations, the PAPR reduction per cycles 
decreases considerably, therefore, optionally, the practical 
implementation of this algorithm can be optimized in order 
to reduce the number of iterations. The break condition is 
given by the value of the approximate balancing parameter. 
This criteria and relate practical aspects are also detailed in 
the original work [15].

Figure 4.  Examples of quasi-nonlinear companding functions.  
The presented algorithm performs a gradual projection 
using a part of the clipping difference at each ACE iteration. 
The clipping delta signal is obtained by imposing each time 
the desired threshold to the time-domain signal. 
The new proposed CGP-ACE method, instead of using a 
part of the clipping difference according with a computed 
ratio at each iteration, applies a progressive signal limitation 
using a given function. Therefore, in this approach, instead 
of fixed clipping to the predefined threshold, a progressive 
signal companding is performed. 
The method may present different derivates according 
with the chosen compression function. However, since no 
additional signal distortion or processing at the receiver is 
desired, the applied compression function must contain a 
linear part for the sub-domain corresponding to the signal 
level under the clipping threshold. 
In order to realize such transfer function, a quasi-
nonlinear compression function of the form proposed in [6] 
must be used. That type of functions contains a transition 
point which defines the border between the linear sub-
domain and the non-linear sub-domain. Some examples are 
represented in Figure 5. 
Based on these aspects, the implementation of this ACE 
method requires the following steps: 
1) Get an OFDM frame with N subcarriers, represented by 
the frequency-domain signal Xo. 
2) Compute the corresponding time-domain signal x[n], by 
use of IFFT function. 
3) Compute the signal's maxima, mean and threshold values 
xmax, xmean, xthr, same as in the previous algorithm, but only 
in the first iteration. 
4) Define the adjustable signal threshold as an increasing 
value within the range of (xmax, xthr). The present work 
considers a linear increasing value of the form:

8) Enforce the ACE constraints, same as in the case of 
previous algorithms.

12) Repeat the procedure according with the given number 
of iterations. The number of cycles can be reduced when the 
maxim value of the ACE delta signal is smaller than a given 
value. 
This new algorithm performs a gradual projection using 
as variable characteristic the signal companding function. 
This function may have different nonlinear characteristics, 
the main condition being to have a transition point where 
the linearity of the function changes. 
The main common operation of all ACE algorithms is the 
application of the ACE constraints on the vectors according 
with the considered extended constellation. 
In order to apply the ACE constraints for the outer points 
of the constellation, their corresponding vectors must be 
changed. Depending on their relative location versus the 
location of the original point and on the allowed extended

domain, the algorithm may change vector’s amplitude or 
phase or both. 
A solution would be to rotate the vector until the outer 
point enters back into corresponding extended domain. 
When this operation is not enough, the vector’s amplitude 
can be increased accordingly. 
In the present work, in order to reduce the computation 
complexity, the ACE constraints are applied by checking 
and changing the Cartesian coordinates separately. The 
present algorithm considers: the constellation’s minimum-
distance dmin, the distance between two adjacent extended 
domains dspa, the coordinate of the original outer point and 
the coordinate of the actual point obtained after clipping. 
When the in-phase or quadrature value is under the 
threshold indicated by the corresponding domain border, the 
difference dext is added to shift the point back into its 
domain. This approach is presented in Figure 5.  
Another variant is represented by the particular case 
where the distance between two adjacent extended domains 
is set to be equal with the constellation’s minimum-distance. 
In this situation, the only allowed shift of the points is 
toward constellation's outer region, no lateral offset being 
permitted. This approach is presented in Figure 6.  
For the case of the M-PSK modulation, the ACE 
constraint is applied using a similar approach. The 
difference is that for the M-PSK case, all constellation 
points can be used to lower the PAPR, and their 
corresponding extended domains are represented by radial 
sectors with the angular size of 
2π/ M
radians.  
With a similar approach, in case of M-PSK modulation, a 
particular variant for ACE constraints can be defined. In this 
model, for all points within constellation, the only allowed 
shift is in the direction given by the original vector, any 
lateral offsets being restricted.  
An important aspect to mention is that the BER 
performance is strongly impacted by the chosen ACE 
constraint model. Therefore, a more restrictive constraints 
set imply a better BER performance.

B. The TR method 
The TR method performs a frequency-domain adaptation 
of a given OFDM frame, in order to achieve a lower PAPR 
level for the corresponding time-domain representation. The 
changes are applied on the set of non-data carriers. The 
method performs an iterative search using different 
combination of complex values from a given set, for the 
considered subcarriers.  
A search for the combination which gives the minimum 
PAPR level would require an exhaustive amount of 
operations, due to checking of whole search space of all 
possible values on all non-data subcarriers. Therefore in 
most of the cases the algorithm is implemented to search for 
a suboptimal solution, within a given subspace. 
In the previous work [1], the considered TR method, 
performs a sequential search according with an one-by-one 
scheme as proposed by [9][14]. The block diagram for this 
method is presented in Figure 7. 
It selects T pilot tones positions from a complete set of Q 
no-data carrier positions and a set of M complex values, 
forming a set of MT possible combinations. 
This search space may lead to an increased amount of 
computation. The chosen tone reservation algorithm 
decreases the computation complexity by attempting a 
reduced search space by trying all M values on the first pilot 
P[0], while the other pilots, P[1],…,P[T-1], have a 
“randomized” or zero initial state. Once an optimal value is 
found, a similar procedure is repeated on the other pilot 
positions. For further computation complexity reduction, the 
time-domain signals equivalent for all pilot tones can be 
computed and stored initially into memory. In this case, 
more operations are done in time-domain, fact which 
determines a decreased number of FFT operations [9]. 
Because the TR method operates on some subcarriers 
from the frequency-domain signal, the displacement of these 
non-data subcarriers may impact the method’s performance.  
Depending by position, the allocation of the reserved 
subcarriers may be symmetrical or lateral occupying the 
lower or higher part of the signal’s spectrum. The

considered variants are presented in Figure 8, Figure 9, and 
Figure 10, respectively. 
The TR method already presented, may provide a small 
PAPR reduction, due to the use of a limited search 
subspace. In order to improve the PAPR reduction, the 
search subspace can be extended by increasing the set of 
possible values for each subcarrier. Such approach may 
provide some PAPR reduction with the cost of considerable 
increased number of operations. Another extension of the 
search subspace consists in the increasing of the number of 
combinations of the considered values. 
In the present work, some new sequential TR derivate 
methods are considered. Within the new proposed SBG-TR 
derivate method, the considered search subspace is extended 
with more combinations of the given set of carriers values. 
For this purpose, the SBG-TR method split the set of non-
data subcarriers in groups according with a given pattern. 
An example of such TR grouping is presented in Figure 11. 
Each of these groups is considered to be a full search 
subspace.

Figure 11.  Grouping of TR subcarriers in blocks. 
The proposed SBG-TR method, performs search of the 
optimal combination of vectors values which presents the 
lowest PAPR within each block, one-by-one. Once the 
vector values for a block are established, they remain fixed, 
the search being continued on the next block of non-data 
subcarriers. 
Based on these aspects, the SBG-TR algorithm can be 
described by the following steps: 
1) Get an OFDM frame with N data subcarriers, Q non-data 
subcarriers, T of them being used within the search 
algorithm. 
2) Consider a set of M possible complex values for each 
vector within the selected T non-data subcarriers. In a 
generalized case, this set may be different for each 
subcarrier. However, for simplicity, in present work it is 
considered to be identical for each of these subcarriers. 
3) Based on a given pattern, group the selected TR 
subcarriers in B blocks, the number of elements within each 
block being K[j], where j=1...B. 
4) Reset all non-data subcarriers to an initial state, 
composed by zero values. 
5) For each of the B blocks, try all MK[j] combinations, the 
one presenting the smallest PAPR level for the equivalent 
time-domain signal representation being stored. 
6) Optionally, the algorithm may be repeated for another 
grouping pattern. 
The algorithm can be generalized, by considering 
different order for the TR blocks. The sequence of the block 
may be ascending, descending, or according with other 
patterns. Another possible extension of the presented 
algorithm may consider non-contiguous blocks. These 
approaches may be used to mix the TR subcarriers from the 
low frequency domain with those from the high frequency 
domain. 
According with the approach used in this method, the 
extension of the search subspace is distributed along 
different parts from the set of TR subcarriers. The size of 
the search subspace extends with the increase of the number 
of subcarriers per block. A grouping pattern with fewer sub-
carriers per block reduces the search subspace accordingly. 
The particular case of one TR subcarrier per block reduces 
this algorithm to the original sequential TR method.

Another approach for applying a distributed extension of 
the search sub-space is to consider a conditioned 
backtracking algorithm. In this case the total number of 
backward steps is limited to a given threshold. The forward 
steps are done when the local gain for PAPR reduction is 
higher than a given threshold, too. The algorithm may be 
applied to entire set of TR subcarriers at once, or can be 
performed on subsets, as in case of the presented algorithm. 
When the TR block follows after the ACE block, as 
Figure 1 indicates, the interfacing of these blocks has to be 
properly adapted. 
Both PAPR reduction blocks have to operate on the same 
signal. Therefore, in order to have same frequency spectrum, 
the non-data subcarriers used within TR block has to be 
available at the ACE block’s input.  
The ACE block performs a nonlinear signal processing, 
which will affect the non-data subcarriers as well. Because 
these subcarriers are not carrying any information, they have 
no ACE constraints as method requires for the constellation 
points of the data subcarriers. From the ACE perspective 
these non-data subcarriers have the optimal value for 
lowering PAPR. 
Contrary, the TR block will change the values of these 
non-data subcarriers in order to search an OFDM alternative 
signal with a decreased PAPR. Because some of these 
subcarriers will provide no improvement from the PAPR 
reduction point of view, the initial value set of the ACE 
block has to be considered. 
In order to make the proper adaptation, the TR 
constellation point set of each non-data subcarrier has to 
include the initial value obtained after previous signal 
processing performed by the ACE block. 
III. 
THE CLIPPING METHOD 
 For analysis of the efficiency of the proposed hybrid 
technique, also a pure nonlinear method has been 
considered. This is the clipping method with frequency-
domain filtering as presented in [18]. The block diagram of 
this method is presented in Figure 12. It consists in a zero 
padding block, an IFFT block, an effective clipping block, 
and a frequency domain block. For a frequency-domain 
input signal represented by a vector Ain with N elements 
[a0,…,aN-1] and an oversampling factor p, the zero padding 
inserts N(p-1) zeros in the middle of this vector, forming the 
new vector Azp. The clipping block limits the amplitude of 
the time-domain signal to a given threshold. The resulted 
signal aclp is then applied to the frequency domain filter 
where the output signal aout is obtained.  
The clipping ratio (CR) applied in this method is defined 
as ratio of the clipping level A to the root-mean-square 
power σ of the unclipped baseband signal, being described 
by the following expression:

The filtering block is composed by an FFT block, another 
zero padding block and an IFFT block. It is designated to 
reduce the out-of-band noise without distorting the in-band 
discrete signal. 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
The MATLAB simulations have been performed for 
base-band signals with N=128 subcarriers using M-QAM 
and M-PSK modulations. The frequency-domain signal is 
extended with additional Q=24 no-data subcarriers. From 
this set, T=12 subcarriers are used for PAPR reduction by 
the TR method. The corresponding constellation consists in 
sets of M=16 points. For the reference clipping method, the 
simulation considers the clipping rate CR having some 
values in the range of 6-14 and the oversampling factor p set 
to 2.  
For the OFDM signal spectrum computation, it was 
considered that the distance between two adjacent 
subcarriers is 0.2 MHz. 
The results presented in this paper are obtained for OFDM 
frames with the repartition of non-data subcarriers as 
previously indicated in Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10, 
with constellations of the pilot search space points identically 
with the constellations of the constellation used for data 
carriers.  
These results consider various combinations of the POCS, 
SGP and CGP ACE methods with the sequential and SBG 
TR method. 
The simulation results show that the proposed scheme 
improves the PAPR reduction in comparison with the use of 
only one of the component methods. The improvement for 
the case of POCS-ACE with sequential TR methods is 
highlighted in this section with three cases.

Figure 21.  BER of OFDM signal before/after clipping. 
In the first case, Figure 13 and Figure 16 indicate the 
PAPR reduction and signal’s frequency spectrum when the 
OFDM frame has the non-data subcarriers configuration as 
presented in Figure 8. 
In Figure 13, it can be observed that the ACE method 
performs a better PAPR reduction while the applied TR 
method obtains a lower PAPR reduction than the clipping at 
a ratio of CR=12. A slight difference can be observed 
between the ACE applied on the initial OFDM frame and 
the extended OFDM frame containing the reserved non-data 
subcarriers. The hybrid ACE-TR provides better PAPR 
reduction since it accumulates the effects from the two 
methods. 
Due to the insertion of the additional non-data subcarriers 
on the both sides of the original spectrum, the obtained 
signal presents an increased bandwidth as indicated in 
Figure 16.  
In the second case, Figure 14 and Figure 17 indicate the 
PAPR reduction and signal’s frequency spectrum for the 
configuration shown in Figure 9.  
Due to a different displacement of the non-data 
subcarriers, the TR method has a different efficiency for the 
PAPR reduction. Even if this method has smaller PAPR 
reduction, with the hybrid method still higher PAPR 
reduction is obtained. Also, this case presents a smaller 
increase of the bandwidth for the resulted OFDM signal than 
the one from the previous one. 
In the third case, similarly, Figure 15 and Figure 18 
indicate the same signal parameters when the non-data 
subcarriers are located as is shown in Figure 10.   
For the PAPR reduction, this case is quite similar with 
the first one. The difference consists on the spectrum of the 
resulted signal, which has a slightly asymmetrical shape. 
Figure 19 shows that the BER performance is slightly 
influenced by the proposed PAPR reduction technique, 
being better than in case of simple clipping.  
For a better evaluation of the performance of the 
proposed method, the PAPR reduction and corresponding 
BER characteristic of the clipping method are presented in 
Figure 20 and Figure 21, respectively. 
The simulations shown that, if smaller values for the 
clipping ratio are considered, the clipping method obtains 
comparable PAPR reduction as the hybrid method do. 
The drawback of this case is that the smaller CR values 
imply an increased signal distortion, and so a worst BER 
performance. 
Therefore the presented simulation results shown that, in 
all these cases, the hybrid ACE-TR method provides better 
PAPR reduction than in case of use of only one component 
method. 
Additionally, 
compared 
with 
clipping, 
the 
combined technique presents no degradation of the BER 
performance.

Similar results are obtained when the hybrid scheme uses 
the SGP ACE and sequential block grouped TR methods. 
The simulation results are presented for the same non-data 
subcarrier displacements as presented before. 
The used SGP ACE method is based on the approaching 
balancing according to relation (11) and is set to use 4 
iterations per OFDM frame. The sequential block grouping 
TR method is configured to use 3 subcarriers per block. 
The PAPR reduction and signal’s frequency spectrum for 
the first case are presented in Figure 22 and Figure 25 
respectively.  
Compared with the previous situation, the ACE presents 
a similar performance like the clipping method. The 
difference is due to a stronger ACE constraint for 
constellation points, as presented in Figure 28. The TR 
schemes also provide a slight different result due 
simultaneous check of more TR subcarriers.

The results for the second case, presented in Figure 23 
and Figure 26 respectively, have the same characteristics. 
Compared with the previous hybrid scheme, in this case the 
ACE and TR performances are different, the PAPR 
reduction efficiency of a method being compensated by the 
other one. 
The results for the third case are presented in Figure 24 
and Figure 27 respectively. The good efficiency of the SBG 
TR method is reflected also in the spectral characteristic, 
where appearance of some non-data subcarriers is 
observable by the wider bandwidth. 
The BER performance corresponding to these cases is 
shown in Figure 30. 
When the ACE constraints become less restrictive, as 
presented in Figure 29, the PAPR reduction efficiency 
increases. The disadvantage in this situation is the higher 
BER degradation as presented in Figure 31.

The simulation results shown that for this relaxed 
constellation constraints, ACE component method provides 
better PAPR reduction efficiency. 
The simulation results for PAPR reduction and spectral 
characteristic for the case with the non-data subcarriers 
displacement of type I, using the SBG ACE method are 
presented in Figure 32 and Figure 35, respectively. In this 
case the ACE method presents a better PAPR reduction 
efficiency compared with the referenced clipping, having a 
slight BER performance degradation. 
Similar simulation results for PAPR reduction and 
spectral characteristic for the case with non-data subcarriers 
displacement of type II are presented in Figure 33 and 
Figure 36, respectively.  
The 
next 
case, 
when 
the 
non-data 
subcarriers 
displacement of type III is used, is presented in Figure 34 
and Figure 37, respectively. 
A specific aspect of these cases is the slightly different 
maximal spectral amplitude. This is caused by the different 
results of the TR method due to the relaxed ACE 
constraints. 
The simulations results consider the new CGP-ACE 
derivate method as well. For this scheme, the simulations 
consider 4 iterations, with a fixed step size of 0.7 for the 
clipping delta signal. 
The corresponding PAPR reduction and signal’s 
frequency spectrum for the considered repartition for the 
non-data subcarrier are presented in the next diagrams as 
followings: Figure 38 and Figure 41 for the type I, Figure 39 
and Figure 42 for the type II and Figure 40 and Figure 43 
for type III, respectively. 
The simulation results show that the CGP-ACE method 
presents similar PAPR reduction performance as the SGP-
ACE method. Due to its different approach, the time-
domain samples have another statistical distribution. The 
corresponding 
frequency-domain 
signal 
changes 
accordingly, therefore a slightly different PAPR reduction 
of the TR method will be obtained. 
Therefore, the presented simulation results show that the 
hybrid method presents a better PAPR reduction also when 
the SGP ACE and CGP ACE are considered. The new SBG 
TR method presents a different performance, which is 
strongly dependent by the used block grouping pattern. 
The BER performance depends by the ACE constraints 
applied on each iteration. 
The computational complexity of the algorithm of the 
hybrid technique is given by the sum of the computational 
complexity of the component methods. The total amount of 
operations depends by the used ACE and TR derivate 
methods. 
In case of POCS method, the ACE block performs one 
IFFT, one clipping, one FFT and one vector shift per 
iteration. For the presented simulations, we have limited the 
number of iterations in the ACE block to one, therefore the 
amount 
of 
operations 
for 
this 
block 
is

.  
In case of the SGP ACE and CGP-ACE, the number of 
operations increases due to the computing of the 
approximate balancing factor and signal companding. 
Therefore the amount of operations for these ACE blocks is 
of

, where C is the number of 
cycles, and B is the number of operations needed to compute 
approximate balancing factor or companded signal. For the 
considered SGP and CGP ACE methods, the additional 
amount of operations B can be approximated to 
4⋅ N
. 
In case of the sequential TR method, the PAPR reduction 
block performs one change for a pilot subcarrier and one 
IFFT per iteration. Considering the applied algorithm and the 
size of the search space, a complete operation requires

 computations.  
In practice, the amount of operations can be reduced if the 
time-domain signal corresponding to each single non-data 
subcarrier is pre-computed and stored in a nonvolatile 
memory. In this case the amount of operations is reduced to

In case of the sequential block grouping TR method, 
where for each block, all possible combinations are 
evaluated, and the total amount of operations increases. 
When the method uses B blocks, the number of carriers per 
block is

is:

Based on these expressions, it can be observed that the 
amount of operations required by the hybrid method is 
bigger than the number of operations required by other 
PAPR reduction techniques and depends by number of data 
subcarriers and the size of the search space used by the TR 
block. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, which represents a development of [1], we 
proposed a new PAPR reduction technique based on the 
combination of different active constellation extension 
methods with different tone reservation methods. 
The paper presents the ACE and TR algorithms used 
within the hybrid technique. The interfacing of the two 
PAPR reduction blocks is also explained.  Besides the well 
known POCS and SGP ACE derivates, the new CGP ACE 
was proposed. Also for the TR technique, the new SBG-TR 
derivate method was proposed. These new PAPR reduction 
methods permit the development of the analysis presented in 
the original work.  
The simulation results, which enhance the results 
reported in original work, show that the hybrid scheme 
realizes higher PAPR reduction for various OFDM frame 
formats. Similar results for PAPR reduction have been 
obtained for the case when TR block precedes the ACE 
block.  
The ACE and TR methods have various derivates, 
bringing different efficiency and performance. The ACE 
method may be implemented using different constellation 
restrictions, obtaining different PAPR reduction levels and 
BER performances. The TR method may use different set of 
values for the non-data subcarriers. Depending on this set, its 
computation complexity and PAPR reduction strength may

significantly vary. In case of the proposed SBG TR method, 
the performance depends by the used block grouping pattern 
and pilot subcarrier displacement, too.   
Compared with other PAPR reduction methods like SLM 
and PTS, the ACE and TR methods presents a variable 
PAPR 
reduction 
efficiency 
depending 
by 
selected 
parameters. In many cases their PAPR reduction gain 
decreases after several iterations. 
Therefore the SLM and PTS methods may present 
increased PAPR reduction, but have the disadvantage of an 
increased amount of computation complexity due to 
expended search space. 
In future work, we will consider different ACE 
constraints and TR schemes with different numbers and 
various sets of values for the non-data carriers.
