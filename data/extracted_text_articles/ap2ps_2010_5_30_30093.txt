Abstract—Peer-to-Peer multicast deﬁned for overlay net-
works, has been taking an advantage over IP Multicast
during recent years. It derives from the fact that the overlay
architecture for P2P streaming provides potential scalability
and easy deployment of new protocols independent of the
network layer solutions at relatively low costs. In this paper,
we focus on modelling and optimization of multiple trees for
ﬂow assignment in P2P multicast systems. The optimization
covers multicast ﬂow arrangement on multiple paths in order
to minimize the overall streaming cost. Due to quality of
service requirements in such kind of systems, we apply a
basic hop-constrained spanning tree and capacitated spanning
tree problems and we deﬁne level-constrained multiple trees
problem with bandwidth capacity constraints for multicast ﬂow
assignment in overlay system. We propose and compare two
Mixed Integer Programming formulations for the problem. In
addition, we examine multicast ﬂows in relation to various
fragmentation of the content.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multicast network technique delivers information to a
group of destinations simultaneously. Over the years, a lot of
research, development, and testing efforts have been devoted
to multicast support [1][3][12][17][18][21][22][23]. Multi-
casting implemented by network-aware approaches using
Internet Protocol (IP-Multicast) is afﬂicted with problems
derived form scalability, addressing scheme management,
ﬂow or congestion control but in contrast, features of overlay
architecture provides potential scalability or ease of deploy-
ment new, network-layer-independent protocols at relatively
low costs. Overlay network strategy expands end-system
multicast [4][11][16] and using overlay based systems has
become an increasingly popular approach for multicast and
streaming, where participating peers actively contribute their
upload bandwidth capacities to serve other peers in the same
streaming session by forwarding their available content.
Overlay multicast ﬂows are realized as multiple unicast ﬂows
at level of a network layer.
In this paper, we consider an overlay P2P system and
ﬂow assignment problem for multicast application based
on multiple delivery trees. We assume constant bit rate of
the multicast stream, which can be divided into separate
fractional ﬂows. Due to the quality of service require-
ments for mutlicast trees structure we employ the hop
constrained spanning tree problem [5] and we formulate
level-constrained multiple trees problem. The main goal
of the problem is to minimize the total cost of delivery
trees without considering issues related to dynamics of P2P
systems and individual algorithm’s tree creation. Cost can be
treated as a distance between pair of overlay nodes and can
refer to delay, physical ﬂow delivery expenses and network
maintenance or cross-ISP’s payments and depends on bit rate
of transferred stream. To solve the problem in optimal way,
we formulate two different mixed integer models. First one,
based on directed multicommodity ﬂow and second, derived
from level-based formulation.
Although the model based on directed multicommodity
ﬂows (DMFM) [7][14] has been applied in past works on
hop constrained trees for single tree creation, the last one is
in general novel. Level-based formulation (LTM) for creat-
ing trees was used in our previous works [19][20] but in this
paper we improve its ﬁrst version and apply it for the level-
constrained multiple trees ﬂow problem. These formulations
provide with ofﬂine optimization, which can be used to ﬁnd
lower bound of other solution approaches or for constructing
initial topology. Moreover some P2P multicasting systems
are generally static (e.g., data distribution in CDN), and
results of ofﬂine optimization can be applied in such systems
to improve the system performance.
Furthermore we compare and contrast these models in
quantitative and time-consumption meaning. To compare the
performance and effectiveness of the formulations in terms
of the execution time we apply the models in Gurobi Opti-
mizer [10]. Our results show that the models can be more
efﬁcient and can enable solving instances in shorter time for
different cases. We also employ the models for examining
in various ISP (Internet Service Provider) topologies the
effect of the tree depth (hop limit) and multicast stream
fragmentation on the optimal delivery cost.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section II we deﬁne Level-Constrained Multiple Trees
Problem and in Section III we formulate it as a inte-
ger optimization problem. In Section IV, we compare and
contrast basic features of the models and present time-
consuming evaluation of building and solving models with
Gurobi Optimizer [10]. Investigations on the impact of
stream fragmentation on the total cost are covered in Section
V. Section VI concludes the paper and presents ideas for
future work.

II. LEVEL-CONSTRAINED MULTIPLE TREES PROBLEM
In this paper we consider an overlay multicast session
with single source and multiple participating receivers. We
assume that, in the overlay system all nodes except of the
root node are receivers. The general objective is to stream
the content as multicast session, which is divided into T
delivery spanning trees representing fractional ﬂows.
For live media applications, a minimized delays or end-to-
end latency at each receiver are signiﬁcant to guarantee the
high liveness and quality of service of the streaming media.
On the other hand multicast system features should include
reliability, availability or even ease of creation of delivery
trees. One of the concept for designing of network-based
systems with overall quality of service constraints is the hop-
constrained minimum spanning tree problem (HMST) [5][6],
which is deﬁned as follows: Given a graph G = (N, E) with
node set N and edge set E as well as a cost ce associated
with each edge e of E and a natural number H, we wish
to ﬁnd a spanning tree t ∈ G with minimum total cost and
such that the unique path from a speciﬁed root node, node r,
to any other node has no more than H edges (hops). Service
quality can refer to availability and reliability, redundancy
at network layer, quality or ease of creation and managing
of the tree.
In accordance to ﬂow problems more useful is arc-based
(directed edges) formulation of the HMST. The directed
formulation replaces every edge e = {i, j} in the graph by
the two arcs (i, j) and (j, i) and associates to each of these
two arcs the cost of the original edge. Analytically, costs can
be deﬁned in asymmetric way, that is, cost of arc cij can vary
from cji. Let A denote set of directed arcs in the directed
model. Notice also that - according to overlay network
structure - we practically consider a complete directed graph.
We assume that there is a bi-directed edge between any pair
of overlay nodes except of the root node. In case of the
root node r we ”remove” directed arcs to the root from any
other node, edge e = {i, r} is only replaced by one single
arc (r, i).
Second, every peer is connected to the overlay network
with link, which has a limited upload and download capacity,
hence peer’s number of all children in all fractional trees is
constrained. Speaking in more precise way, the limitation of
child nodes for peer depends on number of fractional trees
and their streaming rates. The assumptions stated for single
tree can be expressed as the capacitated minimum spanning
tree (CMST) [15]. In this paper we extend this capacity
constraint to multicast system with multiple trees.
The
Level-Constrained
Multiple
Trees
Problem
(LCMT)
The main aim of the problem is to construct an overlay
multicast topology and assign ﬂows on multiple trees, which
are limited with maximum hops. We consider stream S of
constant bit rate and deﬁne constant number of fractional
ﬂows as T with fractional streaming rates st for each tree
t where S = P
t st. This concept can be easily deployed
in real systems with existing codecs, i.e., we can steer or
manage the number of packets or frames as a bit rate in each
tree t. Upload capacity (ui) and download capacity (di) refer
to peer’s i available upstream and downstream bandwidth,
respectively.
Note that, the LCMT contains as particular cases (the
case with T = 1, H = N − 1) a degree constrained
spanning tree or capacitated minimum spanning tree, which
are NP-Complete problems [15] or (the case with T = 1,
SN <= ui) a NP-Hard version of the hop-constrained
minimum spanning tree [6].
III. MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING FORMULATIONS
The general formulation derives from the well discussed,
based on the multicommodity ﬂow model [7][14], which was
successfully implemented for the HMST problem. Several
previously known and developed formulations for the HMST
(single tree) were mainly derived from the multicommodity
ﬂow model and were used for problems with limited sizes
of either hops or arcs [5][6] or for optimization at network-
aware level [2][8][13].
A. Directed Multicommodity Flow Model (DMFM)
The general multicommodity ﬂow model, denoted DMFM
or MCF, uses two sets of binary variables. Variables xijt
indicate whether the spanning tree for fractional ﬂow t
contains the arc (i, j) and additional set of directed ﬂow
variables fijkt specify if the unique path from the root node
r to node k traverses the arc (i, j) in tree t.
In the following IP formulation we consider an overlay
system, which can be represented as a complete directed
sub-graph, which consists of N\{r} nodes and in addition
node r with arcs to any i. Hence (i, j) ∈ A ≡ (i, j) :
i ∈ N; j ∈ N\{i, r}. Further notation replaces set N by
indexing scheme 1, ..., N.

The main goal of the problem (1) is to ﬁnd T level-
constrained spanning trees, which minimizes the total cost of
all ﬂows in the system. Formula (2) refers to the completion
constraint and assures each node except of the root node has
exactly one parent node in each tree t. Constraint (3) derives
from the ﬂow conservation concept and guarantees that the
solution of fractional ﬂow t is a directed spanning tree rooted
at node r. Constraints (4) state that no more than H arcs are
in the path from the root node r to any other node k in tree
t. Limitation of downloads in the systems is constrained by
formula (5). By analogy, we introduce the upload capacity
constraint, which must be satisﬁed with regards to physical
outgoing bandwidth and available capacity of any node i.
To bound ﬂow variable f and tree variable x, constraints
(7) are introduced. These constraints satisfy that every arc
(i, j), which transports ﬂow to any node k in tree t fijkt = 1
exists in tree xijt = 1 simultaneously. Equivalently, if arc
(i, j) is not belonging to the tree t, xijt = 0, there cannot
be any ﬂow fijkt = 0.
B. Level-based Tree Model (LTM)
To model the multicast trees, the LTM exploits a single
set of binary variables xijlt, which equal to 1 if the spanning
tree t contains the arc (i, j) and node i is located at level l.
We assume that the root r of each tree t is located at the ﬁrst
level (l = 1). All children of the root are located at level
2, etc. The proposed notation enables us to set the value of
L as a limit on the maximal depth of the tree. The LTM is
based on a precedence relation between two adjacent nodes
and is deﬁned by analogy to hop-constrained walk [5] or
Steiner Tree Problem in a Layered Graph [9].

The objective function (8) minimizes the spanning trees
cost and includes two elements: cost of ﬂows from any
i ̸= r and arcs, which are starting in the root r. Constraints

(P
i̸={j,r}

l>1 xijlt = 1). Node j ̸= r has exactly one and
only one parent node situated at exactly one level in each
tree t. To clarify upload capacity limitations we introduce
(10) and (11) for outgoing streams from root and any other
node, respectively. Download capacity constraints include
all receiving nodes j (without the root r) and limit the sum
of incoming ﬂows in all trees. Due to the fact, that every
parent node is situated at exactly one level in each tree t thus
to avoid loops, the multiple tree variables xijlt are created
under constraints (13). In this case, every node i can be a
parent of any node j at level l + 1 (xij(l+1)t = 1) if and if
only i’s parent node k is located at level l (P
k̸=i xkilt = 1).
IV. MODELS COMPARISON
Figure 1 presents an example of single, fractional delivery
tree t. The ﬂow view refers to the set of ﬂow variables in
the DMFM formulation. In Tab. I binary variables x equal
to 1 are shown. For the DMFM and the LTM there is only
such straightforward representation of the tree from example
in Fig. 1
The main advantage of the LTM over directed multi-
commodity ﬂow formulation is that we can limit models’
sizes (number of variables and constraints) according to the
selected hop limit. Table II presents sizes of the models.
Variables of the DMFM are xijt, fijkt; and the LTM
are xijlt. Note that the maximum usable value for L is
L = N −1 (in extreme case, the tree is a path bounded with
N−1 levels for locating parents). In regard to this reason, the
number of DMFM’s variables exceed variables of the LTM
by at least 2N 2 −2N for each fractional tree t. ’Constr.’ in
Tab. II refers to the number of formulation’s constraints in
relation to network sizes and represents constraints of (2)-(7)
for the DMFM, (9)-(13) for the LTM.
The computational results were obtained on a PC, Intel
Core2 Duo, 2.13 GHz, 4GB RAM, Windows 7 Professional.
We used the C++ libraries of Gurobi 2.0.2 with default
parameters to obtain the optimal integer solutions of the
models tested. We ﬁrst compare executable build time of

the models. It refers to time, which is needed for dynamic
creation of variables and merging all constraints of the
problem. Fig. 2 presents average time required for building
the models. Average building time of LTM with its upper
bound of L = N − 1 is comparable to DMFM but for any
value L less than N − 1 the LTM is expected to be built
faster in contrast to the DMFM, which need, in general, the
same number of operations irrespective of the hop limit.
A. Experimentation on Networks
We propose to select the arcs’ costs to represent various
topologies at level of inter-ISP connections. Fig. 3 shows
hypothetical scenarios with different topologies at cross-ISP
level. The root node is always in ISP 1 and remaining nodes
are distributed among available providers in proportional
way. To model these topologies we deﬁne cost tables with
the following simple algorithm: if any pair of peers belong
to the same ISP the cost between them is randomly chosen
from 3 to 10. If the shortest path (referred as the number
of inter-ISP hops) between peers equals to 1, the cost is set
from 20 to 40. Distance of 2 ISP-hops introduces cost in the
range of 50-90. We assume symmetric costs (cij = cji) for
all instances but note that costs do not satisfy irregularity
of the triangle. In the remaining simulations we assume all
peers have the same capacity parameters 512kbps for upload
and 1024kbps for download, streaming rate of the session
is S = 252 kbps and streaming rate of each fractional
tree st is derived from the proportional division S into T
trees, i.e., if only one tree T = 1 is used for the ﬂow

allocation its streaming rate s1 = 252kbps, if T = 3 then
s1 = s2 = s3 = 84kbps. We chose S = 252kbps in regards
to provide fractional ﬂows with rational values. Note that,
for T = 5, st = 50.4kbps, which is still rational number
expressed in bps.
Problem’s solving times presented in Figs. 4 and 5 were
obtained for set of 50 instances with 20 nodes and T = 1
for topologies of S1 and S2 respectively. Results shown
there indicate that, the LTM is in general better than DMFM
especially in cases of strongly limited number of levels.
Average solving time by DMFM and can be approximately
treated as constant. Note that time required for solving MIP
problems depends not only on the problem size but also
on values of input parameters (e.g., costs or root location)
and the execution time relation presented in this paper refer
to rather overall rough comparison without delving into
solver implementation and operating system performance.
Moreover, results shown in Fig. 7 presents that, for the much
more complicated instances it is worth using DMFM with
regards to solve problem in shorter time. This can suggest a
general high stability of the DMFM in contrast to the LTM
in computational time meaning.
Finally, all of the presented models can be applied for de-
termining the number of required trees for fractional ﬂows,
for which total cost of ﬂows assignment can be minimized.
Fig. 8 presents optimization costs in relation to number of
trees and allowed levels. Note that, the solution is infeasible
in cases of hop limit H = 1, which means that, the root node
is parent of all nodes in all trees and in case H = 2 and
T = 1. The overall conclusion, illustrated in these ﬁgures,
can be stated as follows: the ﬂow delivery cost for multicast
system based on multiple trees can be decreased if more
trees with more allowed hops are employed, nevertheless,
the most critical impact on delivery cost has limitation of
levels.

V. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK
In this paper, we deﬁned the level-constrained multi-
ple trees problem for multicast streaming purposes. We
assumed that the multicast streaming session is divided
into separate fractional ﬂows, which spread in the overlay
network on multiple spanning trees. These spanning trees
are additionally created under the depth (hop, level) con-
straint. We proposed two mixed integer formulations for
the problem and compared as well as contrasted quantita-
tive and time consuming performance of them. The LTM
applies a precedence relation between two adjacent nodes,
eliminate recording paths to receiving peers and create the
spanning tree as short as possible, what requires less number

of variables and constraints. Experimentation results with
Gurobi Optimizer show that the LTM can improve solving
the problem in computational time, especially for either
limited hops number or small difference between arcs’ costs.
However, generally most ’deterministic’ and predictable
results in computational time meaning are provided with
DMFM formulation (using Gurobi). Moreover, we showed
how to manipulate the table cost for simulating various
structures of inter-ISP connections and the next step is to
analyse more complicated ISP-based topologies with various
root locations, different distribution of peers and numerous
streaming rates for different tree. Finally, results presented
in the paper indicate that, it is worth dividing media stream
into separate fractional streams and constructing trees with
level limitation greater than 4 provides with relatively short
trees without extortionate expenses. Further work includes
examination of various overlay networks with much more
heterogeneous nodes (i.e., upload and download capacities),
more complicated inter-ISP topologies and investigations on
different streaming rates of fractional ﬂows. With regards
to solve the problem for instances of larger sizes, we
plan to design and implement heuristics and metaheuristic
algorithms.
