Abstract—This paper deals with the perturbation induced by
the gauge pressure alongside a combustion chamber. This
perturbation is modeled by acoustic pressure, measured at the
end of the combustor. These vibration modes are obtained
experimentally using Fourier Analysis. The analytic model of
Pressure Distribution Equation (PDE) on can combustor is
based on a wave equation. This paper describes the procedure
that was carried out to obtain the temperature of a column of
hot air inside a simple combustor. The Rijke tube was used
with
the
aim
of
laying
the
foundations
of
a
future
thermoacoustic phenomenon analysis. The contribution of this
work
is
spatial
interpretation
of
pressure
waves
and
displacement in a chamber during thermoacoustic phenomena.

INTRODUCTION
The main indicator for acoustics phenomena is the
excessive heat released that generates pressure oscillations in
the combustion chamber. That relationship between heat and
sound was discovered by Rayleigh [1] and formulated by
Merkli [2]. Thermoacoustic instabilities can cause several
problems in the fuel system such as efficiency degradation,
premature wear of its components and even its catastrophic
failure [3]. This phenomenon, in combination with high
pressures and temperatures (including the incorrect fuel-air
mixing process), produces highly polluting particles, such as
NOx [4].
Nowadays, the state of the art related to thermoacoustic
phenomena affecting gas turbines performance, has been
mainly focused on some techniques as well as swirling flows
[5] and [6]. Swirling flows provide aerodynamic stability to
the combustion process by producing regions of recirculating
flows that reduce the flame length and increase the residence
time of the reactants in the flame zone [6]. Experimental
analysis from combustion test rig using different kinds of
injectors, constrictors, air-fuel mixes have been performed to
find the best technique for combustion system [7]. Also,
another analysis included premixed fluid and Helmholtz
resonator [8].
The gas turbine combustion modelling and simulations
and the acoustic phenomenon implies the necessity of
implementing a control algorithm. The basic gas turbine
model equations [9] are important for analysis, design and
simulation of a control system especially for Combined
Cycle Power Plants (CCPP) [10] and [11]. Focusing on
acoustics, new passive and active control techniques for such
instabilities have been studied and developed [12] as well as
techniques of Adaptive Sliding Phasor Averaged Control
(ASPAC: adapted the phase of the valve-commanded fuel
flow variations) [13] and Multiscale extended Kalman
(MSEK:
predict
the
time-delayed
states).
These
are
promising techniques to reduce the energy consumption
produced by pressure oscillations [14], but more research is
required in this field.
The acoustic model proposed in this work has been
planned to be the first part of a control algorithm to diminish
the effect of the thermoacoustic phenomena into the can-
combustor chamber. This research is carried out in CIDESI
Queretaro,
for
the
National
Laboratory
for
Cooling
Technologies Research (LaNITeF).
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents the analytical model of pressure oscillation trough
air columns. Section III presents a Rijke tube experiment.
Fourier analysis is required to find the fundamental mode.
Speed of sound and properties of the medium, such as
density, are required to determine the parameter values of
PDE. Section IV describes the results and validation of the
model. Conclusions are presented in Section V. Section VI is
related to future work.

ANALYTICAL MODEL OF PRESSURE OSCILLATION
Direct
transformation
between
thermal
energy
and
acoustic energy is called thermoacoustic phenomenon. Three
conditions are required for this transformation to occur: (1)
the medium must be a compressible fluid; (2) a temperature

a) Displacement of air
b) Pressure variation in the air
gradient must exist, and (3) the control volume must be
contained by a physical border (chamber).
The wave equation is a linear second-order partial
differential equation which describes the propagation of
oscillations. The goal of this section is to establish a wave
equation formulation in air column when thermoacoustic
phenomena appear.

Equation (4) describes the distribution of pressures with
no boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are given
by the pressure nodes appearing inside an open tube on both
sides.
Figure 1. Pressure and displacement for the air in the columns.
B.
Pipe open at both ends
A tube open at both ends provides a physical border from
air column. At the open ends, the reflection that occurs is a
function of the extension of the tube and the opening,
compared to the wavelength that propagates through the
tube. The inside of the tube is too narrow, and it is not
possible to dissipate all the energy in the open end. This is
because the phenomenon of reflection takes place. The
reflection causes nodes and antinodes of pressure and
displacement, see Figure 1.
Displacement nodes are associated with motion of air
molecules, or modal modes. Otherwise, each end of the
column must be a pressure node because the atmosphere
cannot allow significant pressure change [16]. Also, (3)
shows the relationship between pressure and motion of the
air.

pressure distribution of a gas contained in a cylindrical

RIJKE TUBE EXPERIMENT
Thermoacoustics
is
concerned
on
the
interactions
between heat (thermos) and pressure oscillations in gases
(acoustics). A “Rijke Tube”, named after its inventor, is a
fundamental
tool
for
studying
the
thermoacoustic
phenomenon. Rijke's tube turns heat into sound by creating a
self-amplifying standing wave. This open cylinder resonator
contains a metallic copper mesh positioned about one-fifth of
the way up the tube. When the screen is heated in a burner
flame and then moved to one side of the flame, it will
produce a strong tone at its resonant frequency for several
seconds.
An experiment was carried out using the Rijke tube [11]
which shows the presence of a thermoacoustic phenomenon,
as depicted in Figure 2. A steel pipe of 0.6 m long and a
diameter of 0.04445 m (1 ¾ in) and thickness 0.00121 m (18
gauge) was used, as illustrated in Figure 1.
xm
is the
distance (0.12m) where a metallic mesh was placed.

Figure 2. Data adquisition for Rijke tube experiment.
Rijke tube turns heat into sound by creating a self-
amplifying standing wave. The heat source was provided by
a gas thorn. The gas thorn adds energy to the system until the
metallic mesh temperature rises to 600 °C. Then, the heat
source is removed and the thermoacoustic phenomenon
appears. It happens when the position of the pipe is vertical.

Fourier analysis
Time
domain
is

physical
signals
of
information with respect to time. It is beneficial when
observing
data
such
as
temperature.
However,
some
applications require analyzing the frequency components of
signals, such as pressure oscillation of the air.
Figure 3.Signal analysis of acoustic pressure.
The acoustic pressure was measured using a microphone
during the Rijke tube experiment. The same performance as
in [17] was present. Time domain acoustic signal does not
allow to see much information for analysis. A Fourier
analysis was required. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an
algorithm that samples a signal over a time (or space) period
and divides it into its frequency components. FFT helps to
find the fundamental frequency of the produced air column
resonance.
The sampling frequency for the thermoacoustic test was
44100 samples per second. Fast Fourier Transform was
applied with a resolution of 15 bits. Frequency resolution
was about 1.34 Hz, which means that every 743 ms the
algorithm takes a package sample to analyze.
Time-Frequency Signal Analysis Acoustic pressure was
measured using a microphone. The signal for amplitude vs
time is shown in Figure 3. The first modal mode occurs at
301 Hz with an amplitude of 0.1941 Pa.
B.
Speed of sound of the air
The speed of sound is only affected by changes in the
medium (density, humidity, temperature, etc.). For our case
study, the element that changed significantly was the
temperature.
On the other hand, the geometry of the combustor
determines related terms like frequency and wavelength. The
symbol  is the length of the wave, that is, the space that the
wave travels in a cycle. Figure 4 illustrates a reflection wave
on pipe open ends. As both the output wave (green) and the
reflected wave (red) only perform half a cycle inside the
tube, the tube length is half the wavelength.
Consider just the motion of perturbation without the
properties of the medium. The fundamental frequency is
inversely proportional to the length of the tube.

Figure 4. First vibration mode in air column.
In an ideal tube, the wavelength of the sound produced is
directly proportional to the length of the tube. A tube which
is open at one end and closed at the other produces sound
with a wavelength equal to four times the length of the tube.
In acoustics, end correction is a short distance applied or
added to the actual length of a resonance pipe, to calculate
the precise resonance frequency of the pipe. The pitch of a

Temperature of the air
Temperature is a physical quantity produced by motion
of the molecules, which gives a perception of hot and cold.
Temperature is associated with friction. Molecular friction is
associated with pressure and density in the air. The ideal gas
law is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases
under many conditions, although it has several limitations.
The most frequently form of a state equation is given in
(9).

The acoustic wave velocity, c, depends on the material
properties. Speed of sound is proportional to bulk modulus
and inversely proportional to density of the air as dictated in
(1).

Equation (11) was defined using nominal values of air.
The density of a substance is its mass per unit volume.
The density can be changed by changing either the pressure
or the temperature. Increasing the temperature generally
decreases the density.
There are table properties of the air which have the
density of the air in terms of temperature.

Pressure distribution along the can combustor is shown in

chambers with similar geometries.

The result of the gradient of air temperature, within a
finite volume and under conditions of natural convection,
was the manifestation of the thermoacoustic phenomenon.
The phenomena presence was used to validate the PDE
model for the pressure oscillation inside the Rijke tube.
Advanced FFT Spectrum Analyzer was used to verify in
real-time how the signal has grown. This is depicted in
Figure 6.

quality is directly proportional to the temperature of the
medium. The melting temperature of the metal gauze
oscillates around 600 °C at t=0 so convectively transferred
the thermal energy and change the properties of the medium.
The homologated temperature of the column was 78 ° C.
It was found experimentally that the speed of sound has
been affected by the temperature change in the medium that
propagates the disturbance, which was 379 m / s. Following
the relationship in (1), we have the fundamental frequency of
the gaseous fluid contained in a cylindrical geometry.

combustor chamber, as well for this study in case of the
Rijke tube.
The PDE model for the dynamic behavior of the pressure
oscillation into a Rijke tube synthesized in this work was
validated by predicting the first mode frequency of the air
column pressure inside.
For thermoacoustic refrigeration, it is very important to
know fluid dynamics and thermal behavior due to pressure
oscillation.

FUTURE WORK
The PDE model synthetized for the pressure distribution
dynamics inside the chamber complemented in (11) to know
the temperature behavior in the same volume, will be the
basis of a control algorithm to regulate the thermal energy in
the chamber surface to avoid or mitigate the effect of
thermoacoustics.
