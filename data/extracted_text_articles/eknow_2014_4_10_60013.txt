Abstract—The question is the understandability and usability 
of a method to develop a knowledge system. A method could be 
the most pertinent, but it might not have a guideline to allow 
its appliance. CICM (Comprehensive Intellectual Capital 
Model) is an algorithmic guide to develop a knowledge system. 
To make it more pertinent, we compared it to GERAM 
(Generalized 
Enterprise 
Reference 
Architecture 
and 
Methodology) requirements, knowing that GERAM is an ISO 
standard (ISO 15704) of engineering of enterprise. We 
deducted strengths and weaknesses of CICM. We proposed 
ACICM Model which is an improved CICM Model, 
contributing to its change, to become closer and for some 
criteria to go beyond to the requirements of GERAM. ACICM 
is more convivial and pragmatic, so more chosen by designers 
of knowledge management systems. Based on weaknesses of 
the method of performance scorecard SKANDIA, we proposed 
an adaptation by enrichment of its set of indicators to be more 
suitable to developing a knowledge management scorecard, to 
give (ASKANDIA).  A hybridization of ACICM, ASKANDIA 
and business intelligence leaded to propose SKACICM 
method. We applied SKACICM on a cement company to 
develop 
e-knowledge 
management 
system 
ameliorating 
performance by a rate of 26%.

 INTRODUCTION 
The emerging field of knowledge management addresses 
the broad processes of locating, organizing, transferring and 
more efficiently using information and expertise within an 
organization. New market forces and infrastructure changes 
have prompted an interest in knowledge management.  
Knowledge management is the name of a concept in 
which an enterprise consciously and comprehensively 
gathers, organizes, shares, and analyzes its knowledge in 
terms of resources, documents, and people skills. The 
benefits of knowledge management are focused on 
improving decision making, reducing cost of employee 
training, and increasing versatility of the workforce. The 
aim is to collect explicit and tacit knowledge to develop an 
e-knowledge management system to ameliorate the 
performance of manufacturing system. First, a succinct 
literature review of the most recent works in knowledge 
management. We tried making an easy usable method 
(method with clear guidelines) more pertinent. We 
improved existing methods using proposed matamodels to 
propose a new method; we used to develop a knowledge 
management system. Finally, we discussed the contributions 
of the new system. 
II. 
RECENT WORKS IN KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
The main objective of Mehralian [5] is to develop and 
prioritize the most important indicators of intellectual 
capital in knowledge-based industries. The highest ratios are 
particularly positive work environment, the ratio of 
investment in R&D (research and development) and the 
number of R&D projects in the structural capital, while 
considering the relational capital. In his work, Lin [6] 
implies that, in addition to the direction of the market using 
innovative practices, the high-tech industry should focus 
more on market knowledge and knowledge management to 
customers. In contrary, we focused on capitalization of 
existing knowledge in the company especially the 
externalization of the tacit ones from the minds of company 
experts to share them and to improve tangible and intangible 
efficiency of the company. Khalid et al. [12] found that 
technology reshapes human behavior and it is the key of 
implementing knowledge management. In our proposed 
method, cultural change is necessary to ensure the success 
of implementing knowledge management. CommonKADS 
is a method we applied in thermal power plant [13] to 
externalize tacit knowledge, it presented insufficiency in its 
modeling language and the absence of implementing tool. 
We applied SKANDIA in cylinder manufacture [14], to 
develop a dashboard for human resources of cylinder 
manufacture. The indicators of SKANDIA were insufficient 
to cover all managerial aspects of the manufacture. 
Therefore, we adapted SKANDIA, adding a set of important 
indicators.

GERAM (GENERALIZED ENTERPRISE REFERENCE 
ARCHITECTURE AND METHODOLOGY) 
GERAM has been developed by the IFAC/IFIP3 task 
force [8]. formed at the IFAC World Congress in 1990. It is 
a framework for the unification of various methods of 
several domains to support enterprise engineering and 
integration. 
It 
comprises 
methods 
from 
industrial 
engineering, control engineering, and information systems. 
It represents a framework rather than a modeling method 
comprising process models and modeling languages. The 
GERAM components describe requirements concerning

reference architecture, modeling language, process model, 
tools, and enterprise models. We proposed an original 
metamodel (Fig. 1) defining the role and goals of GERAM.  
A metamodel is the analysis, construction and 
development of the frames, rules, constraints, models and 
theories applicable and useful for modeling a predefined 
class of problems. As its name implies, this concept applies 
the notions of meta and modeling. 
IV. 
CICM MODEL 
The CICM model was developed by Al-Ali [9] to 
provide a comprehensive framework for the management of 
intellectual capital regardless of its function in the business 
cycle, and whether it is a resource, a process or a product. 
The CICM model is based on the idea that creating value 
from intellectual capital follows the same business process 
or cycle like other tangible resources and assets. It provides 
a framework that  enables management  to understand the 
relationship between the  various disciplines and approaches 
that pertain to intellectual capital management, understand 
the various practices and services that developed under the 
banner of intellectual capital management and know where 
each of these practices fit under the three stages (knowledge 
management, innovation management and intellectual 
property management). Based on its weakenesses deduced 
from its comparison to GERAM requirements, we 
ameliorated it to give ACICM model. To perform this 
comparison of GERAM and CICM, metamodels are 
proposed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. This comparison consists to 
check whether CICM model satisfies GERAM requirements 
V. 
AMELIORATION OF CICM MODEL AGAINST GERAM 
REQUIREMENTS  
In Table 1, the ameliorations of CICM model are 
proposed, based on confrontation of metamodels of 
GERAM requirements and CICM model. The relation 
between the metamodels is wheather the CICM metamodel 
is included in the GERAM one.

We proposed a new concept which is a master plan for 
knowledge management with a timeline and eventual 
costs and value added to the enterprise. This plan 
should be prepared before applying the Ameliorated 
CICM.

We proposed a fifth new view; the knowledge view 
and create diagrams for it. 
VI. 
ADAPTATION OF SKANDIA (ASKANDIA) 
Skandia Navigator is an early model to analyze 
intangible assets, pioneered by Edvinsson [11] at Skandia 
enterprise. It comprises a holistic view of performance and 
goal achievement with respect to intangibles. It’s built of 5 
focus areas or perspectives, each capturing different areas of 
interest: financial focus, customer focus, human focus, 
process focus and renewal and development focus. Fig. 3 
shows globally, the adaptation of SKANDIA to be a 
quantitative 
method 
of 
controlling 
performance 
by 
enrichment of its book performance with new set of 
performance indicators to be up to date and to be more 
convivial to world business. In process 2 of SKANDIA, we 
proposed to use value explorer. For the third stage of 
intellectual capital management, which is intellectual 
property stage, we proposed a suitable method; intellectual 
asset valuation. 
 
Figure 3.  Proposed metamodel of ASKANDIA 
VII. HYBRIDIZATION OF ACICM, ASKANDIA AND 
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE TO GIVE SKACICM 
Fig. 5 shows the principle of the hybridization proposed 
of two ameliorated methods, ASKANDIA and ACICM, 
described in the precedent sections, that consists in the use 
of ACICM to develop the three stages of a system of 
knowledge 
management 
(knowledge 
management, 
innovation 
management 
and 
intellectual 
property 
management), 
and 
performance 
evaluation 
using 
ASKANDIA. A system of business intelligence was 
integrated to our developed system to allow to the company 
to be all the time competitive and resistant to environment 
change. Fig. 4, from the left to the right, explains the

stage. It’s constituted by seven processes; formulation of 
knowledge-based vision, cultural audit and transformations 
to knowledge audit, which an important step is consisting to 
mapping knowledge resources, mapping internal and  
external knowledge flows. Next, it consists to find strategies 
to fill gaps of knowledge, defining communities of practice 
and best practices. Finally, implementation of the 
knowledge base on information technology architecture 
after its design.

VIII. DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND 
INNOVATION SYSTEM USING THE PROPOSED METHOD; 
SKACICM 
The stages of SKACICM method was applied in cement 
company SCIMAT to develop a flexible tool to gather, 
share knowledge between the members of the communities 
of practice. Fig. 6 is an extract from database scheme; it 
shows a part of complexity of the structure of information 
and knowledge needed for the knowledge management. 
 
Figure 6.  Extract from database scheme 
Five communities of practice were created; maintenance, 
human resources, SCIMAT community which is the sum of 
all 
communities 
of 
the 
company. 
Two 
extended 
communities were created; SCIMAT with its partners, 
SCIMAT with University. Further, a special community will 
be created, namely, SCIMAT with its competitors. 
Difficulties are expected when creating this community 
because of the nature of the relationship between them, and 
the conflict of their interests. 
 
Figure 7.   Functionalities of developed knowledge management system  
Among the functionalities of Knowledge management 
system (Fig. 7); learning module, where the members of 
concerned community can consult knowledge books. We 
proposed knowledge books, in maintenance and human 
resources, containing the explicit knowledge and the tacit 
knowledge externalized from experts of the company via 
brainstorming, brainwritings, questionnaires and interviews.  
The module “Electronic Document Management” allows 
the findings of electronic archived documents, plans; this 
makes it easy the research of documents without going to 
document center to retrieve documents wasting in 
sometimes hours.  The module “business intelligence” 
allows the managements of new events, alerts and surveys 
keep company up to date. The module “collaboration and 
innovation” allows a communication, sharing of knowledge 
and ameliorates the creativity of the members of 
community. The novelties are proposed by a member of 
community, reviewed by a panel of experts and published if 
the new idea is accepted. The published idea should be 
applied by the other members of community and voted. If 
the vote gives more than 60% of acceptation, it becomes 
good practice and if it gives more than 75%, it becomes best 
practice. Then, we add the practice to the catalog of good 
and best practices (Fig. 8), and so on. This approach will 
improve innovation and bring wealth to the company.

RETURN OF EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPPED KNOWLEDGE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
A.  Return of experience of professionals, extra studied 
company SCIMAT 
A 
satisfaction 
questionnaire 
was 
used 
for 
the 
professionals extra the company SCIMAT; 72% of users are 
satisfied by the functionalities of the developed system. 51% 
of them consider that it is directly usable by other 
manufacturing system without arrangements. Modules to 
improve according to the questionnaire are the skill 
management and the electronic management of documents. 
B.  Return of experience at the studied company  SCIMAT 
At SCIMAT, 83% of users are satisfied by completeness 
of the developed system. 61% of them consider that it is 
directly usable by other manufacturing systems without 
arrangements. Module to improve according to the 
questionnaire is the security of the system, which we should 
strengthen. The users of company are more satisfied because 
of their participation and validation during the development 
of the system of e-knowledge management.

CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITS 
The analysis performed in this paper has shown that the 
metamodels are helpful to designer to refer to need easily. 
This comes from the readability of the metamodels. 
Furthermore, the ontologies and glossaries are which we 
expect to develop for ACICM. It could not satisfy the all 
requirements of GERAM because ACICM model is an 
enterprise engineering methodology which is only a 
component of GERAM and not a complete Enterprise 
architecture and methodology, certain requirements couldn’t 
be analyzed in this work. A detailed analysis will be done 
based on detailed metamodels, in further work. All of these 
stages processes and steps seem long to apply, in contrary; 
they are very useful for the understandability of SKACICM.  
Contributions 
of 
the 
developped 
knowledge 
management  system are summarised in: 
 It provides the ability to manage its knowledge, ideas 
and personal skills. 
 Stored knowledge is a competitive advantage that 
improves performance in terms of quality and 
profitability. 
It 
allows 
company 
improvement 
performance of 26.82% after its operationalization. 
 A business intelligence system allows internal and 
external audit to prepare company for contingencies. 
 
For supporting the change, and accompany the 
developed system, we recommand to the company: 
 Integrating the competency-based approach because it 
encourages the training according the new needs. 
 Recruitment of a knowledge engineer. 
 Set the new recruits lining with experts. 
 Appeal to retirees if necessary to train new 
employees 
 Encourage reflective practitioners because they are 
experts of the future. 
As perspectives of our work, we foresee apply 
SKACICM in more industrial systems to argue its strengths, 
and at the studied company we foresee: 
 Make the extension to other departments. 
 Integrate existing expert systems. 
 Improve the generator polls for automatic statistical 
interpretation. 
 Quantification of intellectual capital for concrete 
gratification. 
The developed knowledge management is still to 
complete by the other communities of the company, create 
their knowledge books and practices’ catalogs.
