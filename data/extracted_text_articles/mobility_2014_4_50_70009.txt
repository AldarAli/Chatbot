Abstract— The article addresses media accessibility for 
all citizens in the connected TV environment. HbbTV 
(Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV) is an European 
standard 
increasingly 
adopted 
by 
European 
broadcasters. One of the challenges in the coming years 
will be the delivery of multi-platform audiovisual 
content (anytime, anywhere, any device) and making 
this content accessible for all. The elderly and people 
with various disabilities rely on subtitles, audio 
description or sign language. Customizing accessibility 
services through options for personal preferences is only 
one example of future possibilities. This essay highlights 
accessibility issues in the connected TV and smart phone 
environment. It gives insights on the genesis and future 
modules of the European project Hbb4All (Hybrid 
Broadband Broadcasting for All), which started in 
December 2013 for a 3-years-period. It addresses a wide 
range of interactivity, interoperability and personalized 
accessibility features based on the HbbTV(hybrid 
broadcast-broadband) concept and will be user trial 
oriented. Given the recent start of the project, first 
results are expected after a one-year-running-time up 
from 2015. 
 
Keywords-interoperability; accessibility; connectivity; 
multi-platform devices; market take-up. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Is Michel Hazanavicius’ silent black and white film The 
Artist, against the current, at the time of stereoscopic 3D, 
UHD 4K and interactivity? This French film is brimming 
with inventiveness and finds a wonderful support in black 
and white. 
Blancanieves is a 2012 Spanish-French black and white 
silent fantasy drama master film written and directed by 
Pablo Berger [1]. Based on the fairy tale “Snow White” by 
the Brothers Grimm, the story sets a romantic vision of 
1920s Andalusia and is a love letter to European silent 
cinema. 
Neither The Artist nor Blancanieves was specially 
invented for the deaf. And yet, those concerned by some 
form of deafness are very sensitive and may consider the 
film as an advantage. Thus, there have been comments about 
the film as "being deaf, I finally saw my first French film in 
the cinema and I laughed to read on the lips of the actors. I 
can already tell you that they do not jabber anything and 
respect the dialogues. For once I understand better than a 
hearing person ^ ^” [2].  Blancacieves has been audio-
described in the French language by author Paul Memmi for 
blind people. His creation is also a standalone oeuvre, to 
which one can listen to without watching the film. 
Inventiveness and creativity, when associated with 
intelligence and talent, even against the current, can add 
value to the greatest number. The same applies for 
accessibility: first addressing people with disabilities, it is a 
process facilitator that brings ease of use for all, thus 
significant (mass) market developments. 
Connected TV and the second screen allow new user 
experiences with personalized user centric content delivery. 
In terms of accessibility, user studies reported in the EU 
project DTV4ALL [3] that a solution with the interpreter in a 
small window is not optimal, as the picture-in-picture does 
not contain enough detail. Other solutions were preferred, 
and today the average TV screen is becoming bigger [4] 
allowing new user experiences. One of the major challenges 
of the coming years will be the multi-platform delivery of 
audio-visual content (anytime, anywhere, any device) [5], be 
it a broadcast or a (future) Internet IPTV service. Hybrid 
delivery platforms such as connected TVs and two screen 
solutions will be ubiquitous.  
In the following, this article describes the relevance of 
the project with regard to mobility, gives an idea about the 
connected market environment, where accessibility services 
may be deployed, focuses in the following part on HbbTV 
and second screens (understood mobile devices), a section 
that explains the 4 projected pilots considering needs for 
people with disabilities. As the project started only some 
months ago, it concludes with expected results. 
II. 
RELEVEANCE WITH REGARD TO MOBILITY 
Since access to information was officially declared by the 
United Nations a Human Right in 2003, legislation, policy 
and regulations have been introduced and standards were 
drafted to assure einclusion. The legal framework of the 
European Commission is the “European i2010 initiative on 
e-Inclusion – to be part of the information society” (2007); 
this called on the ICT industry to work to help disabled 
people access digital TV and electronic communications 
products. It adopted the Audiovisual Media Services

Directive in 2010 [6]. A toolkit was set up for the 
Transposition of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 
into National European Member States Law in 2008 [7].  
Further initiatives fostered einclusion like the Web 
accessibility Initiative [8] and the possibility for hearing 
impaired and blind to access movies in theatres [9]. The 
roadmap to the European Disability Act [10] is a legislative 
initiative to improve accessibility of goods and services 
within the European internal market, and studies report on 
various projects and initiatives [11].  However, “content” 
processes - from conception, production, translation, 
exchange and archiving to distribution and use - are still 
complex procedures, both technologically and commercially. 
All access services, be they for the elderly or for people with 
disabilities, are language dependent. To turn the accessibility 
vision into reality, the active participation of multiple 
stakeholders is required in the value chain. This is the 
objective of HBB4ALL project [12], that builds on HbbTV, 
as the major European standard, for converged services and 
looks at both the production and service sides. 
The project is co-funded by the European Commission 
under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework (CIP) 
[13] and let by 12 partners from several complementary 
fields: universities, TV channels/broadcasters, research 
institutes, and SMEs (small and medium sized companies) 
[14]. 
This young major European project started in December 
2013 for a 3 years period. It addresses technical, research, 
societal and social issues. It is not R&D (Research and 
Development) financed as such, but fosters market take-up 
of innovations. For example the partners define common 
technical components through different existing applications 
and products to create new services. Furthermore the project 
intends to accelerate the “go-to-market” in building on 
(existing) applications ready to come to the market. 
Therefore, technical adjustments need to be done within the 
connected TV and mobile devices environment, for example 
synchronization. The project partners intend to reach market 
take-off through large scaled user tests in at least 3 European 
countries. 
This project is dealing with connected TV, which means 
interactivity coming on TV, mobile devices using TV 
services and accessibility (for people with impairments like 
non seeing or non/hard hearing people). The second screen 
(mobile and tablets) will be used for accessibility services. 
The project addresses all those screens within the connected 
environment, because the heterogeneity allows creating 
meaningful new applications. Technical working groups 
among the partners have been set up. No public project 
information is yet available on technical issues, and first 
results are expected beginning 2015.  
The following highlights some market considerations, 
technical prerequisites, and focuses on accessibility with the 
HBB4ALL all project, integrating mobility use.  
III. 
CONNECTED MARKET ENVIRONMENT 
EDF (European Disability Forum) [15] counts 80 million 
people with disabilities in Europe, Age Platform AGE 
Platform Europe [16] refers to 100 million ageing people 
throughout Europe. They describe themselves as “European 
network of around 167 organisations of and for people aged 
50+ which aims to voice and promote the interests of the 30 
million senior citizens in the European Union and to raise 
awareness on the issues that concern them most.”  As a mix, 
this represents an estimated 40%+ of the European 
population. These given figures alone represent already mass 
market potentials, only within the field of concerned users.  
Beyond the fact of producing “personalized services for 
all”, originally invented for specific populations, it is all 
about moving from classic accessibility mechanisms to 
personalised media systems that allow to make life and 
access easier for all users. Tablets or touchscreen devices 
expressly show new ways for innovative interactive TV 
content handling, especially with input from the content 
industries. 
Such social innovation topics are discussed for example 
among players from the value chain within the French 
public-private Media4D Think Tank initiative [17]. Media4D 
is a public-private brand initiative from Holken Consultants 
and co-funded by the French State (Direccte), the cities 
agglomeration Plaine Commune (North Paris Region) and 
private partners, among which France Televisions, group La 
Poste, Icade (real estate group), SMEs, user associations and 
creative people. Members of the Think Tank are working to 
set-up a very first multi-device (4 screens) and multi-
accessible (audio-description, subtitling, sign language) user 
experience in different public places in Northern Paris 
territories.  User tests, cross sectorial awareness creation, 
deployment of accessibility applications and services are 
major objectives of the envisaged experiences.  
In the meantime, the Media4D Think Tank is the place to 
get access to concrete examples, discuss the state of the art in 
terms of accessibility in the audiovisual and digital content 
world: R&D, content, audiences’ needs, but also financing 
and funding for content providers as well as potential new 
business models are among the topics.  Creative people who 
include accessibility from the scratch within their content 
production process, story telling or scenario writing will 
probably create very original œuvres and therefore also 
interest larger audiences.  
Imagine a huge film success winning an Oscar – which 
does not exist yet - especially conceived for attention to 
accessibility, that the filmmaker would have included 
directly into the content production process. This Oscar 
would go around the world, inform implicitly and explicitly 
all people, public and professional audiences, about 
accessibility 
and 
e-inclusion. 
Once 
“evangelized”, 
coincidentally market shares for connected TV sets and 
applications 
for 
mobile 
platforms 
would 
increase 
immediately, and time to market for innovative research 
projects on accessibility would be consequently reduced.  
With this thought, Media4D put together researchers and 
content providers, TV channels and digital equipment 
providers, regulators and legislators … to start discussions 
and exchange between stakeholders in the value chain with 
the goal to find ways to boost or create corresponding 
meaningful markets for universal accessibility on the 
different existing devices/screens (cinema, TV, PC and

mobile devices). With this background, the social innovation 
platform integrated the Hbb4All project in bringing social 
innovation strengths to supports dissemination activities for 
the HBB4ALL project, which deals with connected TV 
accessibility, thus interactive service access using among 
others mobiles devices. 
This approach will complement technical skills and user 
trials, as outlined in the following parts. 
IV. 
HBBTV SECOND SCREENS FOR ALL – INCLUDING 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
In November 2012, ETSI published version 1.2.1 of the 
HbbTV specification to include progressive streaming 
(MPEG-DASH) 
and 
some 
DRM 
(Digital 
Right 
Management) support [18].  
A Connected (or Smart) TV set is not necessarily apt for 
truly hybrid interactive viewing experiences. Most often it is 
merely a multi-purpose device that just allows the viewing of 
broadcast television content or using separated and limited 
add-on functionalities through the Internet connection on the 
same screen. 
For the truly hybrid services as offered by HbbTV, an 
“engine” is required that links the broadcast content (offered 
via satellite, terrestrial over-the-air and CATV or IPTV 
networks) and the Internet content (provided by any IP 
connection be it via DSL, CATV, or via mobile broadband 
networks). HbbTV provides such an engine that is activated 
via appropriate signaling within the broadcast transport 
stream. HbbTV is also being used as technology platform for 
portals from network operators, manufacturers and even for 
independent TV Apps, thus benefitting the entire eco-system. 
In principle, HbbTV can be used to provide any access 
service required: EPG, video on demand, enhanced text 
services. For the consumption of television, connected TV 
represents a prime means to help the elderly and people with 
disabilities (but also minorities) to improve their access to 
the TV content. Access services such as sign language, 
subtitles, audio description, clean audio, etc., can be made 
available via the IP link and can be displayed on either the 
main screen (or main loudspeakers, respectively) or on a 
second screen. The services can be made adjustable to the 
individual needs of the users. Especially, the second screen 
allows such tailoring as this is a personal device. The second 
screen application was primarily developed within the EC 
project FI-CONNECT [19]. The technical challenge (not yet 
standardised) is to time-synchronize the displaying of the 
broadcast and the IP delivered content. The EC project 
HBB-NEXT [20] is working on a solution that could be part 
of the HbbTV 2.0 specifications. 
These specifications are, are among others, the basis to 
develop user applications and large scale tests within the 
HBB4ALL project prefiguring future deployments.   
V. 
ACCESSIBILITY TO DIGITAL SOCIETY WITH HBB4ALL 
 
The European HBB4ALL (Hybrid Broadcast Broadband 
for All) project addresses media accessibility in the 
connected TV, namely the new HbbTV (Hybrid Broadcast 
Broadband) environment. One of the challenges for the 
coming years will be the delivery of multi-platform 
audiovisual content (anytime, anywhere, any device), it will 
be a program or Internet service. Platforms’ hybrid delivery 
as connected TVs and solutions to two screens allows a cost 
effective and convenient delivery access for those who need 
those services. The elderly and people with various 
disabilities rely on subtitles, audio description, improving 
dialogue or sign interpretation. Customizing personal 
preferences will be possible within predetermined limits.  
The Hbb4All project aims at: 
• 
Advancing 
solutions 
to 
future 
accessibility 
problems, when HbbTV becomes widespread in 
Europe; 
• 
Understanding interoperability in a multiplatform 
and multi-language communication to test easy 
solutions for media accessibility; 
• 
Benchmarking quality of access services from a 
user-centric approach, and promoting accessibility 
as an added value for education and social 
inclusion; 
• 
Becoming a major platform/player in the e-
Inclusion economy currently taking place, fostering 
the future market take-up of exiting innovations in 
conceiving 
universal 
accessibility 
tools 
and 
concepts to satisfy the diverse interests of all 
societal groups.  
How to watch TV content in PC, tablets, smart phones 
and TVs with an array of communication solutions, such as 
subtitling, audio description, clean audio, and many 
customizable features? Multiple European languages, large 
and small, sign language, and language situation – 
monolingual, bilingual - will be taken into consideration and 
also the three translation modes: dubbing, subtitling and 
voice-over.  
For this purpose, the project will test access services in 
various pilot implementations (from the definition to the 
operational phase) and gather implicit and explicit user 
feedback to assess the acceptance and the achievable quality 
of service in the various delivery scenarios (broadcasting, 
hybrid, full IP). Four interlinked sub-pilots will be 
implemented in the HBB4ALL project:

A. Pilot-A: Multi-platform subtitle workflow chain 
 
Figure 2.  Subtitling effects 
Pilot A deals with Multi-Platform Subtitle Services. 
Across Europe, broadcasters are working to provide subtitles 
on multiple platforms for individuals who are deaf and hard-
of-hearing, or do not have sufficient language skills to 
understand the content without textual support either in the 
original or foreign languages. The main challenge is to 
provide subtitles tailored to the specific needs of the end-
users in terms of channels, platforms and consumption 
requirements. This requires a well-conceived production and 
distribution strategy that allows for the exchange of subtitles 
and their automatic re-purposing producing quality and 
impact-driven access services for multiple platforms. 
B. Pilot-B: Alternative audio production and distribution 
Pilot B deals with alternative audio production and 
distribution. Given EU citizen mobility, TV content is not 
only seen by nationals, but also by large communities living 
away from home. There is also a need to broadcast same 
content in different languages synchronically (e.g., Swiss TV 
or Brussels TV), but the content is not the same across 
languages.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Extra Audio Workflow Scheme 
C. Pilot-C: Automatic UI (User Interface) adaptation – 
accessible Smart TV applications 
Pilot C looks at automatic User Interaction (UI) 
adaptation, and smart TV applications. During the last years 
digital TV as a media platform has increasingly turned from 
a simple receiver and presenter of broadcast signals to an 
interactive and personalised media terminal with access to 
traditional broadcast as well as web-based services.  
The accessibility features of such a service will make use 
of the UI adaptation framework that was developed within 
the European project GUIDE (Gentle user interfaces for 
elderly people) [21].  
 
 
Figure 4.  Example UI adaptation framework 
D. Pilot-D: Sign-language translation service 
The last pilot is related to sign language translation. 
Visual signing for audiovisual media such as film and 
television was shown for the first time in1929 as a means to 
make such content accessible to individuals whose mother 
tongue is a sign language and not an oral language. Users of 
sign language are often born deaf. In many European 
countries, there are constitutional and legal provisions to 
assure the provision of sign language for such citizens who, 
in numerical terms, account for less than 1% of the 
population.  
 
 
Figure 5.  Signing in Belgium – RTBF 
 
Figure 6.  Signing in Portugal - RTP1 
Broadcasters dependent on advertising express concerns 
that an obligation to offer signing would lead to a noticeable 
reduction in advertising revenue, since audiences dislike 
“screen contamination” with the interpreter. Offering closed 
signing (where the viewer can choose to see or not to see the 
interpreter) requires much more bandwidth than closed

subtitles or audio description. Signing is important not only 
for mainstream programming and TV programming 
specifically for the signing communities in Europe and 
elsewhere but also emergency alerts on TV. 
On this basis, HBB4ALL is elaborating pertinent 
guidelines, 
guides 
of 
good 
practice, 
metrics, 
and 
recommendations. It will initiate campaigns to promote the 
project results and thus raise awareness not only on the 
necessity of access services but also on the technical 
solutions available. For that purpose, and to transform 
accessibility vision into reality, Hbb4All targets all relevant 
stakeholders of the value chain. 
VI. 
EXPECTED RESULTS 
Being an ETSI standard, HbbTV is currently linked with 
the DVB TV system family but can, in principle, be used in 
conjunction with any digital TV service in the world. DVB 
is widely used throughout all continents. Sooner or later, all 
countries in the world will have completed their analogue-
to-digital switch-over. As a consequence, the results of 
HBB4ALL will be of worldwide relevance and will, 
through standardisation bodies such as the ITU and ISO, 
also be publicised on a world-wide level. Given the impact 
in close fields such as eHealth and eEducation for example, 
the results from this project will have important results and 
direct impact. On its basis, HBB4ALL is elaborating 
pertinent guidelines, guides of good practice, metrics, and 
recommendations and will initiate campaigns to promote the 
project results, and thus raise awareness not only on the 
necessity of access and interaction services but also on the 
technical solutions available with interoperability. For that 
purpose, all relevant stakeholders, from content providers to 
user associations, will be addressed. The overall objective of 
HBB4ALL is to become a major platform/player in the e-
Inclusion economy currently taking place, fostering the 
future market take-up of exiting innovations in conceiving 
universal accessibility tools and concepts to satisfy the 
diverse interests of all societal groups.
