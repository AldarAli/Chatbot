Abstract—In this paper, we describe simultaneous localization
and communication methods using acoustic signals transmitted
simultaneously from multiple speakers. In the case where short-
time and narrow-band acoustic signals are used, the interference
of signals could cause a systematic error of localization and com-
munication depending on the modulation value. To reduce this
systematic error, a noninterference region was constituted in the
received signal, and localization and demodulation were processed
using this region. Through simulation and real-environment
experiments, it was conﬁrmed that the proposed method can
reduce the systematic error.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and smart
glasses are widely used nowadays. Complementing these is the
location data of mobile devices, which are employed in various
services. Outside a building, mobile devices can precisely
locate themselves via the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS). However, inside a building, the GNSS could make
large errors due to shielding. To circumvent this, alternative
methods for indoor environments have been widely researched
[1].
In this paper, we describe the indoor localization method
using acoustic signals. Acoustic signals simultaneously trans-
mitted by speakers installed in an indoor environment are
captured by a microphone. The location of the microphone is
estimated by using the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of
these signals. As a microphone is embedded in mobile devices,
this system can localize mobile devices without any additional
hardware.
With regard to localization performance, the precision
of localization mainly depends on the transmitted signal. In
general, the wider the bandwidth of the signal, the more
precise is the TDoA estimation. However, from the viewpoint
of scalability, it is desirable to have as narrow a bandwidth
as possible. Similarly, the longer the length of the signal, the
more precise is the TDoA estimation due to the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). However, from the viewpoint of the update rate, it
is desirable that the length of the signal be as short as possible.
Herein, if signals for localization can contain some in-
formation, it simultaneously enables acoustic communication.
Therefore, acoustic signals can be used more efﬁciently and
could expand the range of applications. For indoor acoustic
communication, some methods have been proposed [2][3]. As
errors due to multipath propagation occur, using Differential
Phase-Shift Keying (DPSK) is desirable as it can cancel these
errors. However, if short-time and narrow-band acoustic sig-
nals are used, the communication performance deteriorates due
to interference between the signals transmitted simultaneously
by different speakers. In addition, when the acoustic signals
are modulated, the estimated TDoA have systematic errors
depending on the modulated values.
In this paper, we propose simultaneous localization and
communication methods that can reduce the above systematic
error using short-time and narrow-band signals. In the received
signal of our proposed method, there is a region where each
signal is orthogonal to each other. As the TDoA estimation and
demodulation are processed using this region, our proposed
method reduces the systematic error due to interference.
To concisely discuss the inﬂuence of signal interference
on localization and communication, we evaluated the azimuth
estimation performance by the TDoA of two speakers as one-
dimensional localization.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section II shows the details of the issues dealt with herein and
the related research. Section III describes the proposed method.
In Section IV, comparative evaluations of the conventional and
proposed methods, performed under simulation and real envi-
ronments are discussed. Section V presents the experimental
results and discussions. Conclusions are provided in Section

RELATED WORK
Herein, we describe the problem while performing azimuth
estimation using two speakers and communication by DPSK
simultaneously using short-time and narrow-band signals. To
describe these processes of transmitting and receiving acoustic
signals, we use the chirp signals as an example. The i-th signals
simultaneously transmitted from the left and right speakers are

where ϕR
i
and ϕL
i are DPSK modulation values and α12 =
(f2 − f1)/T, α34 = (f4 − f3)/T. We call these signals a
symbol. The received signal can be expressed as
ri(t) = aRsi
R(t − tR) + aLsi
L(t − tL)
(3)
where tR and tL represent the reception times of the
left and right signals of the speaker. The analytic signals

ci

 could
not match the true reception time, and some error occurs in
the estimated value of the reception time. As the phases of
each term in (6) depend on ϕR
i
and ϕL
i in (1) and (2), the
error in reception time could change depending on the DPSK
modulation value. To calculate TDoA, a similar process is
applied to estimate the reception time of speaker L’s signal tL;
subsequently, an error of the same type occurs in tL estimation.
When the following the Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) signals are used instead of chirp signals,
the above systematic error would occur. This is because si
R(t)
and si
L(t) are not orthogonal except where the microphone is
located at the same distance from the speakers R and L.

In (8), (9), ψR
K and ψL
k are the initial phases that determine
the waveform of the OFDM signal.
The second term in (6) that represents interference de-
creases as the length and bandwidth of the signal increase.
Therefore, in conventional methods, such as chirp signal-based
[4][5], OFDM-based [6][7][8], and CDMA-based methods
[9][10][11][12], and random signal methods [13][14], inter-
ference was avoided by setting the length and bandwidth of
signals to sufﬁciently large values.
In this paper, we propose a method that can reduce the
above systematic errors with short-time and narrow-band sig-
nals. Our proposed method is an extension of the localization
method FDM-PAM [15][16][17] to enable simultaneous com-
munication.

PROPOSED METHOD
In this section, we propose simultaneous localization and
communication methods that can reduce the systematic error
using short-time and narrow-band signals.
A. Transmission Signal
In our proposed method, the speakers R and L transmit the
following signals simultaneously,
si
R(t) =

sin(2πf1t + ϕR
i ) + sin(2πf2t + ϕR
i + π)
0 ≤ t ≤ T

otherwise
(10)

L(t) =

sin(2πf3t + ϕL
i ) + sin(2πf4t + ϕL
i + π)
0 ≤ t ≤ T
0
otherwise
(11)
where frequency fn is set to fn = f1 + ((n − 1)/(T/2)).
B. TDoA Estimation and Demodulation
The process of TDoA estimation for the i-th symbol is
described below. The signals transmitted from the left and right
speakers are received by the microphone as follows:
ri(t) = aRsi
R(t − tR) + aLsi
L(t − tL)

Figure 1 indicates an illustration of received signal. Here,
suppose the absolute value of TDoA |∆t| = |tL − tR| is less
than T/4. From the deﬁnition of fn and the appendix, if the
signal of length T/2 is cut out of the overlapped region of the
received signal (Figure 1), sine waves that compose the cut-
out signal are mutually orthogonal. As shown in Figure 1, the
signal of length T/2 is obtained by cutting out a region from
t′
L+(T/4) to t′
L+(3T/4) or from t′
R +(T/4) to t′
R +(3T/4).
In the following, tmax is the reference time of cutting out. To
avoid the error due to the inﬂuence of (17), (18), tmax is set to
t′
R or t′
L as follows. |ci
R(t′
R)| is larger than or equal to |ci
L(t′
L)|,
tmax is set to t′
R. If |ci
R(t′
R)| is less than |ci
L(t′
L)|, tmax is set
to t′
L. In this section, we take tmax = t′
R as an example. The
same is obviously true for the case of t′
max = tL.
The cut-out signal ri
c(t) is represented as follows:
ri
c(t) = aR sin(2πf1(t + tmax + T
4 ) + ϕR
i )
+ aR sin(2πf2(t + tmax + T
4 ) + ϕR
i )
+ aL sin(2πf3(t + tmax + T
4 + ∆t) + ϕL
i )
+ aL sin(2πf4(t + tmax + T
4 + ∆t) + ϕL
i )
(19)
where ri
c(t) = 0 for t < 0, t > T/2. To obtain the phase
value of each sine wave of (19), the inner product of ri
c(t)
and complex sine wave is calculated as follows:
ci
n =

ri
c(t) exp(−j2πfnt)dt
(20)

(21)
ci

(22)
ci

i ))
(23)
ci
4 = aLT
4j exp(j(2πf4(tmax + T
4 + ∆t) + ϕL
i )).
(24)
The phase values of jci
1, jci
2, jci
3, jci
4 can be calculated as
follows:
ϕi
1 = 2πf1(tmax + T
4 ) + ϕR

(25)
ϕi
2 = 2πf2(tmax + T
4 ) + ϕR

(26)
ϕi

4 + ∆t) + ϕL
i
(27)
ϕi
4 = 2πf4(tmax + T
4 + ∆t) + ϕL
i
(28)
The phase differences of each speaker’s signal are
ϕi
2 − ϕi
1 = 2π(f2 − f1)(tmax + T

T/2(tmax + T
4 + ∆t).
(30)
from the deﬁnition of fn. Therefore, TDoA ∆t can be
calculated as follows:

In (29) and (30), the modulation values ϕR
i
and ϕL
i
are
canceled out. Therefore, our proposed method can obtain
TDoA without systematic error due to modulation values.
In our proposed method, signals are demodulated by using
phase difference between successive symbols [18]. As the
reference time of demodulation, we utilized the ﬁrst symbol’s
tmax.
C. Azimuth Estimation
In this section, we describe the process of converting
TDoA ∆t to azimuth. The relation between TDoA ∆t and
the locations of speakers and a microphone is as follows:
c∆t =
q
(xL − x)T (xL − x) −
q
(xR − x)T (xR − x)
(32)
where xR, xL, x denote the 2D locations of the speakers R,
L, and the microphone. c denotes the speed of sound.
Equation (32) indicates a hyperbola. The hyperbola asymp-
totically approaches a straight line passing through the origin.
Figure 7. Experimental environment.
Hence, the azimuth can be calculated using this straight line.
Figure 2 shows the hyperbola of TDoA and its asymptote. In
Figure 2 the length of baseline is set to 24 cm. In this paper,
the front direction of the speakers is set to 0 degree and the
right direction is set to positive, as shown in Figure 3. The
azimuth θ can be calculated by using TDoA ∆t as follows:
θ = tan−1(
c∆t
√
B2 − c2∆t2 )
(33)
where B is the length of the baseline.

EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we conduct simulation and real-environment
experiments.
A. Simulation Experiments
1) Experimental Setting: To evaluate the inﬂuence of inter-
ference and modulation, we conduct the following simulation
experiment. Chirp signals and OFDM signals are used for
comparison with our proposed method. The chirp signals are
given by (1) and (2), and its parameters are f1 = 2.5 kHz,
f2 = 4.5 kHz, f3 = 4.5 kHz, f4 = 6.5 kHz, and T = 2 ms.
The OFDM signals are given by (8), (9), and its parameters

ψR
1 = ψL
1 = 0, ψR
2 = ψL
2 = π and T = 2 ms. To evaluate
the validity of these method as a comparator, we compare the
frequency spectrum of these method. In Figure 4, although
the frequency spectrum of each method does not match, the
bandwidths are almost the same. Thus, the chirp and OFDM
signals are considered to be appropriate as a comparator. We
call the localization with these signals as the chirp method
and OFDM method, respectively. The reception times of these
methods are estimated by the matched ﬁlter. The parameters of
the proposed method are f1 = 3 kHz, f2 = 4 kHz, f3 = 5 kHz,
f4 = 6 kHz, and T = 2 ms. To avoid the effects of aliasing, the
sampling rate was set to 960 kHz. Figure 3 shows the location
of the speakers and a microphone. The microphone’s locations
were 9 points, which correspond to the azimuths of -40 degrees
to 40 degrees in steps of 10 degrees shown in Figure 3. In this
simulation, the amplitudes of the received signals were set to
the same value for all locations. The number of symbol values
of ϕR
i and ϕL
i was set to 4. To cover all combinations of ϕR
i
and ϕL
i , the values of symbol sequence were set as shown in
Table I.
2) Results: Figure 5 shows the azimuth estimation error
and demodulation error of DPSK for each location. Figures
5a and 5d show that a systematic error occurs in the chirp
method due to interference between the signals transmitted by
speakers R and L at all locations. Figures 5b and 5e show
that a systematic error occurs in the OFDM method due to
interference without the location where the azimuth θ equals 0
degree. This is because TDoA is zero at θ = 0 degree. Figures
5c and 5f shows that our proposed method has no systematic
error due to interference at all locations.
B. Real Environmental Experiments
1) Experimental Settings: To conﬁrm the effectiveness of
our proposed method, we conducted experiments in a real
environment. The signals and locations of the speakers and
a microphone are the same as in the simulation experiments.
In the real-environment experiments, the symbol sequence
having the encoded values in Table I were measured 15 times
at each location. Therefore, the number of localizations was
15 × 16 = 240 and the number of demodulation values was
15 × 15 = 225. The transmission interval of symbols was set
to 100 ms.
The conﬁguration of the measurement system is shown
in Figure 6. For the transmission system, we used a tablet
PC (Microsoft Surface Go) as a signal generator, an am-
pliﬁer (Fostex AP20d), and speakers (Fostex PT20K). For
the receiving system, we used a microphone (Audiotechnica
AT9904), an ampliﬁer (Audiotechnica AT-MA2), and a laptop
(Mouse Computer m-Book P500X2-M2S10) as the recorder.
The sampling rate was set to 48 kHz. Figure 7 shows the
experimental environment.

2) Results: Figure 8 shows the azimuth estimation and
demodulation error of each location. With regard to azimuth
estimation, our proposed method shows the best estimation
performance from Figures 8a, 8b, and 8c. The standard devia-
tion of azimuth estimation by the chirp, OFDM, and proposed
methods were within 7.36, 3.93, and 1.15 degrees, respectively.
As for DPSK, the demodulation performance of each method
were similar in Figures 8d, 8e, and 8f. The standard deviation
of demodulation by the chirp, OFDM, and proposed methods
were within 3.73, 2.27, and, 2.95 degrees, respectively.

DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the cause for systematic and
random errors in real-environment experiments.
A. Systematic error of azimuth estimation
According to Figures 5 and 8, there are clear differences
between simulation and real-environment experiments, and the
received noises are not enough to explain these differences.
In this section, we discuss the causes for this mismatch. In
our proposed method, although systematic errors depending on
the modulation value do not occur, there are some systematic
errors at each location. We consider that these errors are caused
by multipath signals reﬂected from the walls or ceilings in the
room as there is no law on the relation between systematic
errors and locations.
According to the conventional methods, in addition to the
multipath signals, the amplitude of the received signal that
depends on the location could be one of the reasons. Therefore,
we conducted simulations that consider the received amplitude
of real-environment experiments. Figure 9 shows the results
of these simulations of the chirp method. These ﬁgures show
that the systematic errors change in response to the received
amplitude. Thus, in the conventional methods, the received
amplitude is a factor in the difference of the systematic error
between simulation and real-environment experiments.
B. Random error of demodulation
In this section, we discuss the reason why the standard
deviation of the proposed method tends to be larger than the
OFDM method, as shown in Section IV. Figure 10 shows
the error of each symbol for the 16-symbol sequence (Table
I) repeated 15 times at the received location with maximum
standard deviation. Although the errors of the chirp method
in Figure 10a contains periodic systematic errors and random
errors, its random error is smaller than that of the proposed
method (Figure 10b) as the signal length used in the OFDM
method is twice as long as in our proposed method. Therefore,
our proposed method has a disadvantage in terms of SNR, and
its performance might be worse than conventional methods
when systematic errors are small.
VI.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed highly precise localization
and communication methods using short-time and narrow-
band acoustic signals. The simulation and real-environment
experiments showed that our proposed method could reduce
systematic errors compared to the conventional methods as
interference between the acoustic signals could be avoided.
