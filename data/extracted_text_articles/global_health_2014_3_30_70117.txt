Abstract–In the area of medical information collection, 
transportation, presentation, and analysis there are a lot of 
standards. Many of them contradict each other. Mobile devices 
are a new domain of medical equipment. To enable their 
communication with different hospital information systems, 
standards have to be implemented. Standards selection and 
implementation is a hard process. The aim of this paper is to 
present the available standards concerning medical data 
exchange and how to transfer these standards and their 
applicability to the current mobile devices and remote 
applications oriented to medical and health care. A solution 
oriented to archetype data representation is presented, as a 
way to solve some information presentation problems. 
Keywords-telemedicine; medical standards; conformance; 
electronic health record. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The increasing use of mobile and individual healthcare 
devices is one of the major tendencies in out-of-hospital care. 
Many vendors provide extensive sets of those devices. 
Unfortunately, most of them cannot work outside their 
servers and service software. Transition of health data 
between hospitals, healthcare providers and health insurance 
companies is still very limited. Some of these limitations are 
defined by law restrictions, but many result from data format 
differences and general incompatibilities. The only way to 
solve these incompatibilities is to follow available standards 
and to maintain all new devices to be compatible with those 
standards. Common use and exchange of information 
between different actors in the healthcare process, in 
particular in clinical diagnostics process, is only possible if 
all partners adopt a common format, content, structure and 
meaning of exchanged messages. 
This article targets some ideas and standards for their 
implementation in the area of health informatics and the 
correspondence between them and new generations of 
personal mobile healthcare devices. 
This present paper is structured as follows: Section II 
presents the health care data exchange process and 
appropriate to it communication standards; Section III 
presents the archtypes as conceptual structures and their 
place in the medical data presentation process;  Section IV 
briefly presents the design steps for mobile device software 
outlined in the archetype concept; Section V concludes the 
paper.   
II. 
HEALTH DATA EXCHANGE AND COMMUNICATION 
STANDARDS 
Exchange and interaction between the different actors 
can be discussed in terms of infrastructure or the application 
side. 
A. Infrastructure level 
This level corresponds to the interchange formats related 
to communication and transport protocols used from layer 1 
(physical ) to layer 6 (representative) of the OSI (Open 
System Interconnection) model [20] of the ISO (International 
Standard Organization). At this level, there are defined 
channels of communication (network connections, satellite 
communications, telephone systems, etc.). 
B. Application level 
This level corresponds to the content of the message, and 
it is divided into the layers of the syntax, semantics and 
pragmatic. According to the OSI model, that corresponds to 
the layer 7 (application layer). 
Syntax layer describes the rules presenting how various 
phrases, 
signs 
and 
other 
may 
be 
combined 
into 
corresponding 
messages 
containing 
data 
or 
control 
information. These rules define the shape, consistency and 
physical representation of the messages. 
Semantic layer (content layer) describes the content of 
the message and it requires an agreement on how to interpret 
the data unambiguously. An external system of terms 
representing medical concepts can explain   the meaning. 
Many health organizations describe the data using their own 
conventions. As a result, in the process of data exchange, the 
receiving system cannot understand these codes if it does not 
have appropriate classification catalogue. Data exchange 
between many organizations is practically impossible. That 
is why standardized clinical nomenclatures are widely 
applied 
(clinical 
vocabularies, 
controlled 
medical 
terminology, etc.). A standardised clinical vocabulary 
provides a means of accurately, clearly, and reliably 
communicating medical information.   
Context (pragmatic) layer describes the information 
and knowledge about the environment (context) where the 
message is generated. Together with semantic, the pragmatic 
level describes some of the content of the message.  
At higher levels, it is much more difficult to achieve a 
common understanding of the content of the message 
elements.

Hereafter, we present the major existing and evolving 
standards in the field of medical informatics. The 
presentation is made from the lowest to higher levels of 
application level, i.e., the level of syntax to pragmatic level. 
By “standard”, we understand collection of specifications 
adopted by a standards organization or group. In the last two 
decades, many organizations have proposed standards for 
data exchange, but unfortunately most of them are defined at 
the level of syntax only. 
A. Syntax layer standards 
These are generic standards, such as ASN.1 (Abstract 
Syntax Notation One) [21], EDIFACT (Electronic Data 
Interchange for Administration Commerce and Transport) 
[22], XML (Extensible Mark-up language) that are 
independent of the field of application. Specific to the field 
of health are standards of the HL7 organization (Health 
Level 7) 
[23], 
the 
DICOM 
(Digital 
Image 
and 
Communications in Medicine) [9] of the American College 
of 
Radiology 
(ACR) 
and 
the 
National 
Electrical 
Manufacturers Association (NEMA), representing a standard 
for the formatting, processing and storage of digital images 
and its associated data and the standard IEEE 1073 - MIB 
(Medical Information Bus). MIB is applicable to the 
exchange of data between devices located in intensive care, 
critical care and operating rooms (such as monitors, infusion 
pumps, ventilation devices). However, the DICOM was 
published back in 1993; so the standard precedes the 
development of the web technologies like XML and web 
services and uses binary en-coding for the graphical 
information. To overcome this problem, two additional 
supplementary standards were developed - Web Access to 
DICOM Persistent Objects (WADO) [10] and DICOM 
Structured Reporting (SR) [24]. 
Work on the specialization of the generic standards, such 
as XML, to answer service specific requirements of health 
applications, has started in the past few years. 
B. Semantic layer standards 
The following standards can be assigned to this level: 
LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers, Names and Codes) 
[25], GALEN (Generalized Architecture for Languages, 
Encyclopaedias and Nomenclatures in medicine) [26], 
GRAIL Language (GALEN Representation And Integration 
Language) 
[26] 
and 
the 
multi-axial 
Systematized 
Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms SNOMED – CT 
[27]. The KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format) [28] is 
language for knowledge exchange and is characterized by 
declarative semantics, i.e., the meaning is straightforward 
and well defined. 
C. Pragmatic layer standards 
The list of these standards is presented by the model of 
the European Committee for Standardization (CEN, French: 
Comité Européen de Normalisation) - European Healthcare 
Record Architecture (EHCRA). In 2004, the ISO Technical 
Committee 215 published the specification TS 18308 – 
Requirements for an Electronic Health Record Architecture. 
It is extended with ISO/TR 20514 published 2005. This 
report introduces the generic definition of the Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) – a repository of information regarding 
the health status of a subject of care, in computer processable 
form. Most of the novel developments like CEN EN 13606 
and OpenEHR are based on this technical specification. 
III. 
ARCHETYPES AS CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES 
When attempting  to “plug-and-play” a new device from 
some vendor in an existing health network, the most 
important is the pragmatic layer.  
The GEHR (Good European Health Record) initiative 
started at the beginning of the 90-s as European Union 
project. Currently, this initiative is maintained by an 
international online, non-profit organization, called the 
OpenEHR Foundation [29]. 
The most noteworthy concept of this initiative is a 
knowledge-based model, also known as the archetype 
modelling technique. It facilitates, on one hand, the 
specification of a generic clinical record structure, and on the 
other hand the specific semantic definitions of clinical 
contents. This model utilizes a dual-level methodology to 
define the EHR structure. More specifically, the first level is 
used to define a small, but constant in time, Reference Object 
Model (ROM) for an EHR, which typically contains only a 
few generic, concepts/classes (e.g., role, act, entity, 
participation, observation, etc.). In addition, at this level (the 
level of the ROM), additional methods on how to organize 
and 
group 
clinical 
information, 
capture 
contextual 
information, query and update the health record, and use of 
versioning to safely manage clinical information from a 
medico-legal point of view, are specified [4]. The second 
level is used to define constraining rules and mechanisms 
called archetypes. The archetypes role is to specify the 
common data structures, which have been created in the first 
level.  
The OpenEHR initiative defines a formal language called 
ADL (Archetype Definition Language). The main purpose of 
this language is to describe the three main parts of each 
archetype: descriptive data, constraints and ontological 
definitions [7]. The descriptive data usually contains a 
unique identifier for the archetype; machine readable code, 
which describes the clinical concepts modelled by this 
archetype; different metadata, like version, author etc. The 
constraining rules describe the core of the archetype, define 
the possible constraints of a valid structure and also describe 
the contents of the component models for EHR. The 
ontological part defines controlled vocabulary, which can be 
used in specific parts in the archetype instance. Archetypes 
are chunks of declarative medical knowledge that are 
designed to capture maximally expressive and internationally 
reusable clinical information units. They encode knowledge 
about clinical observations, evaluations, actions and 
instructions regardless the context, in a coherent and holistic 
manner. Archetypes are based on conceptual structures of 
medical knowledge. Medical ontologies conceptualise 
domain objects, actions and relationships among them; the 
archetypes, representing the blueprints of defined medical 
domains, are focused on capturing clinical information about 
the patient.

GLOBAL HEALTH 2014 : The Third International Conference on Global Health Challenges

Analysing the important types of information in the 
health care process, we select the Clinical Investigator 
Record Ontology, where the observations (evidences) and 
opinions (inferences) are different categories (see Figure 1). 
This taxonomy provides the categories in the Entry classes of 
the openEHR reference model [31]. 
In 2008, the archetype approach to structuring patient-
related records became ISO standard 13606-2:2008, as a 
specification of the information architecture required for 
interoperable communications between systems and services 
dealing with EHR data [14]. This way, ISO 13606-2:2008 
defines how to organise hierarchically the EHR content, how 
to define the individual data items and their aggregations, 
what types of values or measurement units are appropriate, 
and so on. Archetypes are viewed as a serialized 
representation, an exchange format for communicating 
individual archetypes between archetype libraries.  
All this work makes archetypes as a platform for 
integration in future mobile device connectable to extended 
hospital or other health care networks. 
IV. 
DESIGN STEPS OF SOFTWARE FOR MOBILE 
APPLICATIONS CONFORMING TO ARCHETYPE CONCEPT 
To design a new mobile device which can be “plug-and-
play”-ed the following steps are recommended (technical 
design is excluded):  
 
Definition of minimum clinical data set - the main goal 
of this step is to prepare appropriate data set for clinical 
data measurements. This involves the definition of the 
measurements to be performed. A specialized data set 
of clinical markers for patient’s status description has to 
be provided. 
 
Data standardization - the goal of this step is to prepare 
presentation of all registered markers and measurement 
results as clinical archetypes according CEN EN ISO 
13606 standard. The possibility to integrate the 
obtained measurement and analysis results to available 
EHR has to be proposed. 
 
Design 
of 
infrastructure 
level 
communication 
depending on the exact communication environment. 
This number of steps looks simple, but they offer several 
possibilities 
to 
design 
devices 
with 
standardised 
interconnection interface. As an example, the archetype for 
blood pressure introduced in [19] will be discussed. 
Minimal data set consists of the following elements:  
 
Blood pressure (BP) 
systolic BP 
diastolic BP 
mean arterial BP 
pulse BP 
 
State/ Position 
 
Standing 
 
Sitting 
 
Reclining 
 
Lying 
 
Lying with the tilt on the left 
 
Other - cuff size, location of measurement, method, 
mean arterial pressure formula, diastolic endpoint, etc. 
Based on this data, we can obtain an extended archetype 
as presented in Figure 2.  
The presented in Figure 2 archetype gives a basis for 
software development and extended presentation of obtained 
patient’s data and environment of its obtaining for electronic 
health records and its transfer to hospital information system.  
We did a preliminary software design, based on the 
proposed archetype. Simple implementation on a single-
board-computer based on ARM processor is done, as well. 
The implementation is only for design validation. The design 
and testing environment includes a program generator for 
embedded devices and semi-natural simulator [30][31], 
which were used to build the software and to simulated 
operating environment. No real sensors, actuators and similar 
were installed. The module operated in a simulated space, 
connected to an external computer. This computer ran a 
simplified model of the blood-pressure measurement device 
physical hardware and communicated via physical signals to 
the embedded computer. Some of simulations were very 
simplified and only imitated some behaviour. This did not 
degraded the validation process because its target was the 
archetype software representation not the real device control 
and precise measurements. According to some previous 
work [32] and prototype of a Hospital Information System 
(HIS), implemented under Bulgarian National Science Fund 
Do02-113, some data transfer has been realized. All

activities were only test and validate the idea to use 
archetypes as software design paradigm for unified medical 
data transfer form mobile medical device to HIS.  
It does not have any medical validity and only proves the 
possibility to implement the presented formal technology on 
a physical devise. 
Some lessons from this implementation are that software 
design has to be very precise and to follow the archetype 
design 
without 
variants 
and 
“adaptations”. 
The 
communication increases because more data are transferred. 
Data composition in the mobile device and its parsing in the 
HIS are simple. Here is one of the most useful elements of 
this design. Data can be recognized without some specific 
extra 
information 
because 
the 
archetype 
model 
is 
implemented both in the HIS and the mobile device. Every 
mobile device conforming this this archetype can exchange 
data to the HIS. Of course, the protocol can be unified also, 
but we discussed this in the previous sections. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a general overview about the 
available standards for medical information interchange and 
their usability for system-to-system and device-to-system 
connection. We discussed about availability of standard 
elements in clinical descriptions. It is evident that the 
conceptual structures, designed to capture patient-related 
clinical information in order to ensure its systematic 
representation, need a long period of development, 
standardisation and wide adoption in order to provide 
interoperability. First step in this direction is the presented 
way to generate a formal archetype and after that – to 
transfer it on a specific hardware, implementing all needed 
data acquisition and communication actions. Technically, 
this is not a problem. Today the problem is to achieve a 
common understanding of the exchanged content   between 
systems and not a used data transfer technique. The proposed 
new type of thinking in terms of archetypes and conceptual 
structures solves many problems in this area and reduces 
standards contradictions.
