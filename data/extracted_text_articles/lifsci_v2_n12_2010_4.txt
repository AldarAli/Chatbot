overwhelming and required to be readdressed. Mostly these terms
are overlapping. Definitions of triad of telediagnosis, different
ways of communication (real and virtual) and medical robots
(Roboscope and Roboop) are given. There is increase demand of
teleclinics or telehospitals to absorb these terms to avoid

telemedicine and discuss new concept of Virtually Presentable or
Virtual Presentia (VIP) and Virtually Accessible or Virtual
Absentia (VIA) Specialist Hospitals leading to Absolute Virtual
Hospitals. Classification of virtual hospitals, identification of
available resources (computers), manpower (virtual specialists)
and modes of communication (absent or present) will lay down
foundation of new aspects for telediagnosis as well as medical

INTRODUCTION
A new concept of Virtual Specialist Hospital is promising
and required to promote field of telemedicine, medical
education and confidence of patients [1-3]. Telemedicine
may be as simple as two health professionals discussing a
case over the telephone or as complex as using ICT
(Information and Communication Technology) to conduct a
real-time teleconsultation or telerounding between medical
specialists in two different countries. In telemedicine typical
scenario, two doctors are involved with the patient i.e., a
local attending doctor and a remote tele-doctor who is
engaged to do variety of services ranging from tele-
consultation to tele-surgery, as well as tele-diagnosis where
a doctor diagnoses a sickness [4]. Local attending doctors
mostly are medical officers or nurses. Remote tele-doctors
are specialists from different disciplines of medicine with in
the boundaries of any country but across the borders
generally both are specialists to exchange their views. Care
at a distance (in absentia care) is evolved from an old times
practice
of sending prescription through postal letters to
current modern telemedicine by using information and
communication technology. Use of whistle, smoke signals,
drum beating, loud speakers and two-ways radio powered
by dynamo of bicycle to warn about diseases from a
distance are established facts [5]. Telemedicine tends to be
taken for granted in developed countries but lacking in
developing
and
underdeveloped
countries
because
of
shortage of facilities and awareness. Even critics are there to
declare
it
responsible
for
overburdening
of
already
overburdened doctors in urban areas. Proponents are over-
enthusiastic and happy even with only one e-Health
specialist in countries like Rwanda [6]. Interrupted and slow
internet services with availability of one computer will not
stop them from declaring their clinics as tele-clinics. A
comparative study is available regarding urban and rural
doctors indicating good physicians’ perception of usefulness
of telemedicine in both groups and is positively related to
their intention to adopt this technology [7]. Telemedicine
improves the delivery of healthcare to rural and under-
served communities as well as reduces the sense of
professional isolation often reported by practitioners in these
types of communities [8].Telemedicine is a helpful tool to
reach people whose voices are not being heard as much us
as the peoples in the main cities. Patients from rural areas
are in great need of health services without the need of
traveling long distances and in a much shorter time, that
could mean a matter of life or death [9].
Its role in urban
and rural areas is well established fact but commonly
focused on rural areas due to lack of proper hospital
facilities. Urbanization is directly related to development of
infra-structure including hospitals therefore, its significance
in
cities
is
comparatively
less
than
remote
areas.
Telemedicine
may be
considered
as
branch
of rural
medicine. It may turn out to be the cheapest, as well as the
fastest, way to bridge the rural–urban health divide [10]. Its
role in disastrous situation like Tsunami may be more
helpful [11-12] Telemedicine is not well placed speciality,
because it is equally shared by electronic and software
engineers and medical doctors.
It is also considered as
branch of engineering in which, knowledge and skills are
developed and applied to define and solve problems in
biology and medicine [13]. In fact, it is a marriage of
convenience
between
medicine
and
information
and
communication technology. Telemedicine system consists
of a personal computer with customized medical software

connected to a few medical diagnostic instruments (ECG,
X-ray machine or X-rays scanner) [14]. Through this
computer, digitized versions of patients' medical images and
diagnostic details (such as X-ray images and blood test
reports) are dispatched to specialist doctors through the
satellite-based communication link. Retrieved information’s
are analyzed by specialist to reach on diagnosis and
therapeutics. The entire system is relatively user-friendly.
Dr Devi Shetty an Indian cardiac surgeon with special
interest in telemedicine said “99% of non surgical patients
are not required to be touched by physicians. Therefore, no
need to be there too in terms of disease management and can
be managed by telemedicine [10].Another study conducted
by Iftikhar and Muralindran suggest that more than 75%
acute cases of orthopaedic can be diagnosed by Otorob
(orthopaedic
robot)
through
telerounding
or
teleconsultation[2-3]. On the other side a tele-doctor is
sentenced to 9-months in jail after prescribing Prozac to a
teen who later committed suicide in Colorado [15]. When it
comes to diagnosing and treating new problems, a physical
examination
and
face-to-face
meeting
is
imperative
especially when you are un-known to the patient [16]. Once
you remove the hotel component from the hospital, you
erase 60% of the cost [17]. Therefore, telemedicine is a
better alternative to remove hotel component from medical
field
to
make
it
cost
effective.
Remote
presence,
telepresence, distant presence and virtual presence are being
used in literature interchangeably [18]. Virtual reality is
often used when "actual reality" is expensive to create,
dangerous to inhabit, or simply does not exist. Thomas B.
Sheridan is one of the first scholars to investigate the
concept of presence and let alone a theory of telepresence or
virtual presence [19]. The RP2W (Remote Presence 2-Way)
is a one of the remote presence robot which, allows
professionals
in
different
geographical
locations
to
teleconference and establish a remote presence via a mobile
robot [20]. With novel applications of mobile robots in the
field of medicine, new terminologies are emerging rapidly
too. Telepresence or Remote Presence (RP) is the ability to
project yourself to another location (without leaving your
current location) and to move, see, hear and talk as though
you were actually there [21]. Virtual means the quality of
affecting something without actually being that something
[22]. In prevailing situation when most of the studies in the
field of Telerobotics and Telemedicine are designed by non-
doctors, confusions, overlapping and multiple notions for
same option are possible. Telerounding [23], telereferral
[24], teleconsultation [25], and telediagnosis [26-27] are
being
used
synonymously
too.
Teleconsultation
and
telerounding are considered as more effective and efficient
by ensuring diagnostic information is gained in advance
[28]. Researchers are working without concentrating on
model of real hospitals. Presently, there are no concepts of
Tele, Remote or Virtual Presence Hospital in literature in
their true spirit on the basis of absent presence concept
given in this paper.

Similarly it is not possible to know whether study is based
on virtual synchronous presence (telerounding in wards and
teleconsultation
in
clinics)
or
asynchronous
presence
(telereferral) without going in details of study design.
Definitions of triad of telediagnosis are given in Table I and
can be further clarified
by following description. In
telerounding mobile robot is controlled by remote physician
and drove to the bed of a patient by him for real time (hard
or soft) communication depending upon speed of internet.
But teleconsultation is being used here for real time tele-
examination of patient in clinic. In “Telediagnosis” as
practiced
by SICOT
(international
society dealing
in
orthopaedic and trauma) patient data is collected from 29
countries interlinked to each other [26]. Later experts review
the patient data and give their expert opinions regarding
diagnosis and management. Data is reviewed by experts
depending on their availability and later suggestions are
stored for members to enhance their professional expertise.
It is better to use tele-referral rather than telediagnosis in
this
situation.
Target
of
tele-referral,
consultation
or
rounding is to reach on telediagnosis by different means.
Telediagnosis is defined as “Determination of the nature of
a disease at a site remote from the patient on the basis of
transmitted tele-monitoring data or closed-circuit television
consultation” [27]. This definition of telediagnosis is mainly
emphasizing on telereferral by using transmitted data and
teleconsultation
but
tele-rounding
is
not
being
fully
corporated. The term absent presence describes individuals
who use information and communication technologies
(ICT’s), while in the physical presence of others, who may
or may not be engaged in the same [29]. This can be
explained by usage of laptop in a parks or social gatherings.
This scenario explained physical presence in the park but his
involvement in virtual word. Virtual presence and absence
are proper words to explain these situations respectively. It
is our common experience while chatting suddenly someone
has to logout because of certain work or disruption in
connection. Person who is waiting for him is Virtually
Present (VP) or Complete Virtual Presence and other is said
to be Virtually Absent Presence (VAP) or Partial Virtual
Presence. Therefore, it seems meaningful to mention which,
organization, hospital, department, facility, doctor and staff
is virtually absent or present to avail facilities and giving
full benefits to ailing humanity. Here we are using these
terms in different context. If internet connection lines are
disturbed, then we signed in and out alternatively. In other
words
we
are
jumping
from
real
to
virtual
world
alternatively. During this time we are not serving any

purpose for virtual or real worlds. It is better to name it as
Virtual Absent Presence or Partial Virtual Absence. In case
of Virtual Absence or Complete Virtual Absence, although
person is not sitting on internet at all but retrieves data when
required. But in reverse situation, i.e., virtual presence,
person is lively enjoying with internet in real time.
Sometimes, it is part of our duty to sit on computer and
reply immediately by internet when required i.e., on-call
duty. Although we are not using internet in this situation but
with a click of mouse, it is possible to enter in virtual world
as a part of duty. This we can label as Virtual Present
Absence (VPA). Practically VPA user is just away from
click of mouse, i.e., equivalent to Virtual Present (VP).
These both (VP and VPA) are grouped under VIP (Virtually
Presentable or Presentia). Similarly VA and VAP are
grouped
as
VIA
(Virtually
Accessible
or
Absentia).
Additionally, we aimed to review literature related to
terminologies of telemedicine and to fit them on a hospital
model. Re-definition of tele-referral to distinguish it from
tele-consultation and
tele-rounding
will enhance
more
understanding of these terms for their applications in
telemedicine. We commonly send the data of patient only
(tele-referral) and wait for physician to reply depending
upon his or her convenience (asynchronous). But in reverse
situation, remote doctor not only receives data from hospital
lively but can see his remote patient too. If the patient is in
clinic, we termed it as teleconsultation but in case of ward
patient, it becomes telerounding, location of the doctor does
not matter except his distant presence. Tele-consultation for
out-door and tele-rounding for indoor ward’s patients are
better choices respectively. Data (patient medical record) is
available in the clinic or hospital and accessible to physician
easily during video-conferencing (synchronous) to reach on
final
diagnosis
(telediagnosis)
with
the
help
of
investigations (tele-echocardiography, ECG, X-rays, blood
reports and others, etc.).
Similarly in our medical practice, doctors used 2 common
words, non-interventional (X-rays, ultrasound, etc) and
interventional
procedures
(intravenous
cannulation,
endoscopy, etc.). Therefore, it is better to use Roboscope for
non-interventional and Roboop (“op” from operation) for
interventional medical robots to understand their rule.
Active (first) and passive (second) on-call terms are
commonly used in hospitals. First or active on-call doctor
suppose to stay at duty location and whereas, second or
passive on-call doctor can stay outside hospital. Passive on-
call doctor will replace or give him support if and when
required. Virtually Present Absence (VPA) is equivalent to
passive on-call doctor in real practice. If a doctor just
receives data of a patient, analyzes it, and sends it back after
review, is not actively involved in virtual word and
considered
as
Virtually
Absent
Presence
(VAP).
We
targeted at following aims and objectives for this study

To search commonly used
medical terminologies
in field of telemedicine and review of literature.

To
differentiate
between
Teleconsultation,
Telerounding, Telereferral, and Telediagnosis.

To rationalize new terms like VIP/VIA Specialist
Hospital, Roboscope and Roboop

To define different ways of virtual communication
and their application to new concept of virtual hospitals.

To rationalize possible role of Virtual Hospitals in
web based medical education.

To prepare algorithm by following web designs of
ten state level hospitals to accommodate different terms
related to telemedicine .
We explored three different search engines (Yahoo, MSN,
and Goggle) during May 2009, to know frequencies of
different terms, e.g., tele-medicine, tele-presence, tele-
rounding, tele-diagnosis, teleclinics and tele-doctors, etc.
IEEE Xplore [30-33] was taken as professional web
explorer to search work on telemedicine. IEEE Xplore was
selected as a search engine because of
its proven
contribution for enginers, who are valuable researchers in
the field of telemedicine. Review of literature and personnel
experience of main author leads us to define new concept of
VIP or VIA Hospitals and other terms. Web designs of 10
state level hospitals were taken as a role model to define
these terminologies and to prepare algorithm for our virtual
hospital. Literature is not available regarding any effort to
prepare
such
classification
and
algorithm
for
virtual
hospitals. Currently our project is onging under title of
SAKIT
(Sikuati
And
Kota
Kinabalu
Informatics
&
Teleclinic). Sikuati (village of district of Kudat, Sabah) and
Kota Kinabalu (capital of
state of Sabah)are representing
rural
and urban areas of Malaysia. SAKIT is Malay
equivalent of pain, representing ailing humanity.
Review of literature is
followed by aims and objectives
and methodology in Section I . Proposal, discussion and
conclusion, consitute Sections II to IV. Discussion section
emphasis on clarification and
rationalization of our new
terminologies in the field of telemedicine. Possible future
pivotal role of virtual hospitals for the field of medical
education is given too. This concept article will provide
basic foundation to researchers for catagorization and
standradization of tele or virtual hospitals.

PROPOSAL
A.
Frequencies of Terminologies
Telehospitals
enteries
are
less
than
teleclinics
but
telehealth centre is more frequent than both of telehospital
and teleclinic.Telenurse and teledoctor is equally famous in
health sector, representing active participation from both
professionals (Table II).Telehealth centres are more in
numbers, even by sum of both telehospitals and teleclinics.
There were about 2263 search entries on telemedicine and
413 on telepresence out of 2,061,238 online documents on
IEEE Xplore digital library [33]. Numbers of search varies
by same terminologies in different ways, like telemedicine,
44

tele medicine (spaced) or tele-medicine (dashed), especially
numbers become very high if tele and medicine are written
with spacing and should be avoided. One way of writing
should be practiced for scientific terms. Most of work in
field of medicine is data processing, i.e., telereferral
according to our perception but all the search engines
showed
little
literature
on
it.
Although
telerounding,
teleclinics and other terms are present in IEEE Xplore but
only telediagnosis, telepresence and telemedicine can be
searched by its engine therefore, search criteria should be
revised. Other terms either cannot be explored or their
frequency on search engine is negligible. Yahoo, MSN and
Google search engines are giving higher numbers of search
entries but relevance is limited and non-scientific terms
appeared more than scientific e.g., beautician are using
teleclinic term quite often. Doctors, nurses and paramedical
staff are three actors around patient in a hospital (Figure 2)
and search entrees related to them are more than the
hospitals, where they are working (Table II). If we summed
up all terminologies searched by four engines, telemedicine
(90.13%), telepresence (7.69%) and tele-health centers
(1.18%) represent about 98%. Other remaining terms are
less than 2% and none of them is more than one percent.
Therefore, their percentages are not given in Table II. Our
data suggests that only telemedicine and telepresence are
acceptable but others terms are not well recognized yet.
Even telemedicine is still not established speciality in well
known medical institutes. Its fate lies between medical and
engineering
faculties
because
of
multidisciplinary
involvement.
B.
.New Concept of Virtual Hospitals or Teleclinics
We tried to define six ways of communication in
telemedicine based on literature, clinical experience of 18
years of main author in the field of medicine, day to day
observations while video-conferencing and comparing six
ways of communication in real life (Table III). Simply
virtual presence and absence are divided into absolute,
complete and partial sub-divisions like that of real, making
it 6 in numbers. These terms laid down the foundation of
our concept of VIP and VIA Specialist Hospitals. Figures
1and 3, represent the pathway to telediagnosis by referral,
consultation or rounding. It also explains our concept of
Virtual Hospital through synchronous and asynchronous
ways of communication.
1)
Types of Absolute virtuality
a) Absolute Virtual Presence
It is possible in near future when “Simulated Virtual
Doctors”
would
advise
theirs
patients
by
automated
software programs and Virtual Mr. Bob may work like Real
Mr. Bob [22]. Katherine Hayles described a new idea of
simulation in her book titled “How we became post-
human”. According to her, “In future human simulation and
its corporeal existence may look similar” [34]. This
philosophy may open new chapter in telemedicine by
Absolute Virtual Present Hospitals (AVIP Hospitals). How

far away we are from this era is difficult to predict or
impossible to achieve. But desires and dreams are endless to
reach on destination of absolute virtual presence hospitals.
b) Absolute Virtual Absence
It is applicable to remote areas of the world where, ICT’S
facilities are not available yet [35]. A unique way of
communication is documented in spiritual religious books
especially QURAN [36] where Prophets can talk to the God
(Allah) and even communication between remotely present
Holy Peoples (Prophets and Their Friend) is documented
without any mediating ICT’s. These Holy Peoples may have
strong auditory and visual God given brain cortices to
perceive such signals which, common peoples could not.
This type of communication is not possible to fit on real or
virtual criteria’s. It is for the researchers to decide, how they
take it? Currently we are unable to define AVIA Hospitals
because
of
ambiguous
definition
of
AVIA
way
of
communication (Figures 1and 3). In Table III and Figure 1
our six types of communication leading to concept of virtual
hospital are given. But AVIA terminology should be re-
defined to make it practical for hospitals. In future neuro-
signals enhancement may be possible by exploration of new
techniques to improve brain activities especially for visual

and
auditory
function.
In
this
situation,
weak
communicating signals may be intercepted by strong
auditory and visual cortices of brain. In certain diseases,
human beings perceive visual and auditory hallucinations
that are non-existing. These may be because of more
enhancements of respective brain cortices. Once these
methods will be well established transmission of auditory
and visual images may be transmitted and perceived without
any intervening ICT facilities. There is another established
fact that positive feed back to brain leads to establishment of
neural interconnections to enhance brain abilities. This is
possible area of research in future to make our dream of
Absolute
Virtual
Absence
Hospital
true.
Although
theoretically these things look promising but how many
decades or centuries are required to reach on this destination
is not known. If it becomes true reality then people at
distances can talk to each other with out any mediator like
Mobile technology, P.C’s or Laptops and even doctors can
give consultation to their patients from distances.
2)
Analysis of Some Current Virtual Hospitals
There is no unified structure available regarding types of
teleclinics/hospitals in literature. It is difficult to know types
of services available in such clinics due to misnomer or
confusing terminologies. From skin care clinics to well
establish telehospitals are misleading e.g., skin care is
domain of beauticians whereas telehospitals are dealt by
medical doctors and telediagnosis is phenomenon to reach
on diagnosis in a teleclinic/hospital [37-38]. Different
services factors in terms of internet speed, static/dynamic
way of communication, GP/Specialist consultation, active or
passive on call (availability of doctor with in or out side
hospital)
are
the
issues
to
be
considered
to
design
telehospitals. Therefore, we will analyze few available
teleclinic on the basis of our new concept of virtual hospital
and above factors for better understanding. Results are
summarized in Table IV.
a) SICOT Telediagnosis [26]
Telediagnosis [26] is store and forward type of teleclinic
where doctors (GP’s/Specialist) report clinical issues to
remote doctors, by emails. Data is reviewed, diagnosis are
made and available for further referencing. Telediagnosis is
a misnomer in a sense that it reflect outcome of any clinical
issue but not explain the types of services in terms of static
or dynamic modes etc. This project is linking 29 European
countries. Therefore, it represents our Virtual Absentia
Hospital (VIA).
b) Virgin Airlines Telemedicine [39]
The Virgin airline has just announced a deal with Remote
Diagnostic Technologies (RDT) that will result in each of
Virgin's
planes
being
outfitted
with
the
Tempus
telemedicine system which, contains blood pressure and
pulse monitors along with an integrated video cam, and
transmits data down to medical personnel via the on-board
telephone system. This system is based on dynamic video
teleconsultation.

Six types of virtual communication
c) IHS Telehealth System [40]
It provides a comprehensive health service delivery system
for approximately 1.9 million out of 3.3 million American
Indians and Alaska Natives. It comprises of approximately
2,600
nurses,
930
physicians,
390
engineers,
500
pharmacists, 300 dentists, and 170 sanitarians. This provides
both dynamic as well as static tele-services along with home
care. Its focus is on clinical, educational including public
telehealth program too. It represents our Comprehensia
Virtual Hospital (VIC). It is not possible to compare
Rwanda e-health system where only one tele-specialist is
available with such a huge system [6]. Therefore, it is
irrational too compare both systems under same category
although both are dynamic in nature. It is reasonably good
to put later type of hospital under Virtual Absentia Hospital
due to shortage of specialists there. It is self-explanatory to
declare any hospital as virtual presence hospital dynamic
mode of communication, infrastructure, internet speed as
well as human resources must be enough to handle the
patients. In summary, if dynamic hospitals lack sufficient
staff or facilities should be considered as Virtual Absentia
Hospital.
C.
Triad of Telediagnosis
Doctors are responsible for diagnosis of different diseases
through 3 different ways of communication. We labeled
them as Triad of Telediagnosis i.e., Teleconsultation,
Telerounding and Telereferral. Theirs definitions are given
in Table I. First two are grouped under dynamic and third is
considered as static type of communication. Most of the
projects having dynamic type also have static component
too but it is better to be considered as Hybrid or Combined
variety. We tried to isolate different telemedicine projects
on this basis in Table IV and pathway to tele-diagnosis is
given in Figure 3.

Types of Medical Robots
Medical robots are classified in different ways and one
classification is given below [41].
1)
Robot to assist doctors (physicians and surgeons)
These are helpful for surgery, exploration, diagnosis and
therapy.
a) Surgical robots
These
are
commonly
used
in
orthopaedics,
neurosurgery and general surgery etc.
b) Non-surgical robots
These
are
popular
in
tele-echocardiography,
tele-
ultrasonography and tele X-rays etc.
2)
Robots to assist peoples
a) Assistive robotics
Robots and machines that improve the quality of life of
disabled and elderly people, mainly by increasing personal

independence
e.g.,
orthopaedic
devices
(exoskeletons),
robotics aids, smart living spaces and personal assistants.
b) Rehabilitative robotics
These are robotics mechatronic tools for clinical therapy in
neuro-motor rehabilitation and training etc. These are
temporarily used therapeutic tools. Our concept of division
of robot for doctors is based on their direct interference to
the patient i.e., interventional and non interventional. It is
justified below along with definitions in Tables VI and VII.
E.
Roboscope and Roboop (Medical Robots)
It is based on two types of procedures in the hospitals, i.e.,
interventional (endoscopy, arthroscopy, angioplasty and
venous
or
arterial
catheterization
etc.)
and
non-
interventional
(echocardiography,
ultrasonography,
CT
Scans and MRI etc.). Field of medical telerobotics is also
following the same tract, i.e., interventional (Telesurgery
[42], Doc at a Distance for tele-operations [43]) and non-
interventional
(RP-7
or
RoboDoc
[21],
and
Tele-
Echography [44]). Therefore, it is better to use Roboop and
Roboscope respectively (Figure 4 and Tables VI and VII).
This way ultimate user, i.e., health professionals also can
explains to their patients that this robot has no business in
direct management of the patient in case of Roboscope.
Therefore, robot is an assistant but not the replacement or
master of a doctor. In Table VII different medical robot are
divided into 2 groups depending upon their applications
e.g., Otorob with Docmata is robot only meant for
telerounding or teleconsultation but da Vinci is an operating
robot
and
directly
involved
in
surgery
by
hands-on
technique. Therefore, these are considered as interventional
robot.
F.
Algorithm for Virtual Hospitals Web
Our work related to design a web algorithm for Virtual
Hospital is in progress so that different terminologies (Table
V) can be adjusted on a standard protocol. Our target is to
evaluate web sites of 10 different state level hospitals to
design a model for Virtual Hospitals. Due to work in
progress, wider applications and lengthy web designing
process, it is not possible to cover this objective in this
paper. We are progressively moving towards it and will
present our results in its second part soon. It is an empty
field of telemedicine and will open a new era for researchers
and web designers to establish novel websites.

III.
DISCUSSION
A.
Telemedicine Terminologies
If we look at Table II and V, it is self evident that
telemedicine is a branch of medicine and repetition of “tele”
is not appealing. Therefore, it is better to bold the 1st letter
of terminology rather putting “tele” every time, e.g.,
Referral for tele-referral and Clinic for tele-clinic. Another
option is encircling of the first alphabet of the word but this
way typing options are limited. Encircled letters are only
available for R and C on a key board like ®eferral or
©linic. Other options can be explored like usage of Italic
words. With invention of mobile robots telerounding [45-
50] is getting popularity in literature as compared to
telereferral although, most of the work in telemedince is
data processing, i.e., tele-referral. But term telereferral itself
is not famous in literature (Table II). In surgical wards
telerounding is of two types, i.e., pre and post operative tele-
rounding. Pre-operative telerounding is mainly concerned
for diagnosis and planning for surgical procedures but post-
operative telerounding [51] is concerned with patient care
after surgery. In medical wards initially it is concerned with
diagnosis
by
history,
physical
examination
and
investigations like pre-operative telerounding but its later
part is more focused on the management. Any patient seen
in clinic is commonly considered as consultation. In real
practice medical record is available near bed side of patient
but in clinics, staff nurse provides medical record to the
doctor for further management. Therefore for tele-rounding
and tele-consultation both data availability and patient
presence are pre-requisite. But for referral cases, referring
doctor sends a written or verbal requisition to another doctor
to see his patient. Appointment for consultation depends
upon availability of doctor and severity of disease. Same is
the case with Tele-Referral. Once tele-referred case is seen
by any doctor should be termed as teleconsultation.
B.
Virtual hospitals
In most of the studies tele-medicine is helpful for the
mankind [52-53] but opponents are also there. Maurice
Mars at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in the South
African
coastal
city
of
Durban
said,
"We
may
be
transferring the problem (of diagnosis and care) from one
overburdened doctor to another overburdened doctor by
telemedicine"
[54].
Therefore,
specialists
with
minor
physical ailments for virtual hospitals can be considered as
an alternative. This way we will not overburden the already
overburdened doctors by using relatively inactive doctors
from
medical
community.
Catharine
Omaswa
of
the
Ugandan National eHealth Committee noted that her
country might only have a modern ICT infrastructure by
2025 but Rwanda’s only e-Health Specialist, Richard
Gakuba is happy with telemedicine in his country [54]. VIP
OR VIA Hospital should be the specialist hospitals.
It is
pointless to establish virtual hospitals without specialist
support because patient may not be satisfied by remotely
present medical officers. It is better to name them as VIA
rather VIP Hospital if shortage of specialist is there to avoid
misleading to the patients. Similarly, where internet services
are of poor qualities should be categorizes as VIA hospital.
The Philippine health care system is crippled by shortage of
doctors and telehealth centres are seen as a tool to bridge
this gap [55]. Pakistan, Bangladesh and Tunisia are on the
tract of telemedicine too [56-58]. Virgin’s Airline is starting
telemedicine system in their planes [59]. Even telemedicine
has opened the doors in battle fields [60]. Communication
may be mediated (telephonic call) or unmediated (face to
face). Technology (ICT’s) mediated communication is of
two types asynchronous (fax, beeper, voicemail, e-mail, or
an electronic discussion group) or synchronous (telephone
call, videoconference, or electronic chat room) [22]. All
these possibilities can be explored from country to country
for telemedicine application too.
1)
VIP (Virtual Presentia) Hospitals
Virtual Presence (VP) is better term for real-time activity,
e.g., tele-consultation or tele-rounding. The on-call doctor,
who is off-line but available to his remotely present patient
with a click of mouse, is considered as Virtually Present
Absence (VPA). He will serve the same role as passive on-
call doctor in real practice, therefore should be considered
as same functional unit, i.e., VIP.
2)
VIA (Virtual Absentia) Hospitals
Virtual Absence (VA) or Virtual Absent Presence (VAP)
are responsible for delayed responses, e.g., tele-referral and
better to be discussed in another functional unit, i.e., VIA
Hospital.
Good patient health care system is targeted to
reach on Telediagnosis either by VIP or VIA mode of
communications followed by treatment. The treatment is
either given by the locally available staff or sending support
at patient’s own location or calling patient to real hospital
depending upon circumstances under the guidance of tele-
doctor. With better understanding of these terms we can
categorize different set-up available in the world, e.g.,
Remote Diagnostic Technologies based on telerounding and
teleconsultation
[61]
is
VIP
Hospital
and
SICOT
Telediagnosis project is VIA Hospital based on virtual
Absence. This VIP or VIA Hospitals will allow client
(patient and their families) to know about facilities available
in hospital pre-hand. Establishment of VIP Hospitals in true
spirit will become important like VIP peoples too in future.
But in VIA Hospitals, patients have to wait for their data
analysis
first
(tele-referral)
to
consult
their
doctors
(teleconsultation).
In
other
way,
patient
wills
get
telediagnosis via data analysis by static or slower path.
Therefore, VIA Hospital is preferable term. IHS Telehealth
System in U.S.A. divided their clinical services menu as
Real-time (mental health, cardiology and rheumatology
etc.), Store and Forwarded (cardiology, dermatology and
radiology etc.), and Home Care (heart failure and diabetes
care) [62]. Its first two terms are comparable to our VIP or
VIA Hospitals and third term mimics home care like real
practice. Therefore, this systems is combination of all three
49
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 2 no 1 & 2, year 2010, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

VIP, VIA and Real Home care services. In literature, remote
presence is used for real things and virtual presence for
simulation. Similarly dynamic (synchronous) and static
(asynchronous)
terms
are
used
for
off
and
online
transmission respectively. In this study we used virtual and
remote presence interchangeably. In addition to off and
online, we also considered the some issues of slow internet
and disturbed line to make it more meaningful. Similarly,
shortage of specialists and inadequate internet facilities were
considered
equivalent
to
offline
transmission.
These
changes will build the confidence of ultimate user (patient
and their families) regarding available facilities in Virtual
Hospital. Clients (patients) will be in a position to choose
VIP or VIA Hospitals depending upon their requirements. If
urgent attention is required then VIP Hospital will be better
option compared to VIA Hospital. These two broader
categories of virtual hospital will also prevent community
from cheating (labeling of telehospital by availability of
only one computer or one doctor) by further legislation and
standardization. In our opinion cell, mobile and hand phones
are different names for same product and function. But this
paper focused on the matter because same name is being
utilized for different modalities or vice a versa. For example
in Africa tele-hospital having one computer or one specialist
and in USA having 100’s of specialists are being placed
under same category of telehospital or clinic. Therefore,
these should to be standardized for proper understanding.
Role of Virtual Hospital in Medical Education: Developing
countries are trying to establish educational hubs because of
high
expenses
in
developed
countries
[63].
Medical
education is one way to attract overseas students; even USA
is trying to attract foreign students [64]. Medical schools
and universities are increasing in numbers but proportionate
increase
in
the
hospital
number
is
not
there.
This
disproportion is jeopardizing the quality of education [65].
Our concept of VIP Hospital can be extended to non-
teaching hospital to use them for teaching purpose to
overcome the shortage of hospitals. Similarly VIA Hospitals
can be utilized for examination (MCQ’S, MEQ’S and
OSCE) and continuous medical education, i.e., CME’S.
Simulated dynamic (virtual) and hybrid dynamic (virtual
plus real) transmission is commonly used for tele-education
and real dynamic (remote) and off-line (static) transmission
is for tele-diagnosis. Similarly this new concept of virtual
hospital will help us to define utilization of absent and
present services in its true spirit for medical education too.
Absent services will be used only for information purposes
while present services will be better option for live real time
teaching and demonstrations.
C.
Roboscope and Roboop
Similarly term Roboscope for non interventional robot will
enhance confidence in patients because of familiarity of
word “scope” as well as their minimal interference. Their
approval from health authorities will be easy compared to
interventional robots (Roboop). Safety issues in Roboop
will be questioned in more detail by relevant health
authorities before their approval compared to Roboscope.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Telemedicine and telepresence are growing fast in their
popularity
in
the
field
of
medicine
but
medical
terminologies are misleading for tele-experts especially
telerounding, teleconsultation, telereferral and telediagnosis.
Therefore, should be used cautiously, otherwise conflicting
situation may arise. VIP and VIA Hospitals are promising
terms and required to promote field of telemedicine, medical
education and confidence of patients. Although virtual or
remote presence terms are commonly used but still wider
applications are possible after its proper understanding.
Roboscope and Roboop are new terms to differentiate
between
non-interventional
and
interventional
medical
robots. Work is in the progress for model website for virtual
hospitals and relevant results will be presented later.
