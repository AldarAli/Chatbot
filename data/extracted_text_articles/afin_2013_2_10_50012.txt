Abstract—Data trafﬁc in mobile networks are rapidly grow-
ing because of the diffusion of smartphones and rich applica-
tions. It is effective to cache contents data in networks to reduce
trafﬁc load. Breadcrumbs was proposed to discover cached
contents efﬁciently. Each router records trace information of
content download, which is called Breadcrumbs, and redirects
request messages along the Breadcrumbs trail. Furthermore,
several extensions of Breadcrumbs, e.g., Active BC, Hop-aware
BC, MSCR, BC Scoping, have been proposed. In this paper, we
evaluate mutual effects among those extensions when they are
working in the networks at the same time. Evalution results
revealed that combination of ABC and MSCR has the synergic
effects regarding improvement of cache hit ratio.

I. INTRODUCTION
Because of the diffusion of broadband access and smart-
phones, it becomes ordinary to consume rich contents such
as video through the networks. According to the Cisco’s
report [1], a smartphone generates 24 times more trafﬁc
than a non-smartphone. It also reports that trafﬁc in mobile
networks will grow 6.3EB per month by 2015. It estimates
that video trafﬁc will account for 66% of total trafﬁc.
Following the expansion of contents distribution and M2M
(machine to machine) communication, the number and sort
of contents in the networks will be enormous. In order
to avoid congestion of network due to contents ﬂood, it
is effective to cache popular contents in the network [2].
Paul et al. proposed Cache and Forward architecture [3],
which the contents are cached by routers in the networks.
Furthermore, the concept of Data Centric Networking are
proposed [4][5]. It is convenient for users to be able to
get desired contents without knowing their locations but
with using content IDs. For the cache networks, because
of the complication to manage all the locations of cached
contents, it is desirable to route request messages to the
nearest caching node with content IDs through the networks.
Breadcrumbs [6] is proposed to efﬁciently discover cached
contents in the cache networks. With Breadcrumbs, each
router guides request messages to the cached contents with
in-network guide information called Breadcrumbs (BC). In
order to solve various drawbacks of Breadcrumbs, several
extensions are proposed, e.g., Active BC (ABC) [7], Hop-
aware BC (HBC) [8], BC Scoping [9] and Mapping Server
with Cache-location Resolution (MSCR) [10]. Because these
extensions are not exclusive each other, they can be used
together. When using some of them together, a certain
synergy or conﬂict will be supposed. In this paper, mutual
effects among several extentions are evaluted with the proto-
type system implementing Breadcrumbs and its extensions.
Evalution results revealed that combination of ABC and
MSCR has good synergic effect regarding the cache hit ratio.
It is also observed that some extensions can compensate
loss of performance each other. The remainder of this paper
is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy explains the
basic scheme of Breadcrumbs. Section III explains several
extensions of Breadcrumbs. Section IV shows environments
and assumptions for the evaluation. In Section V, evaluation
results are discussed regarding performance metrics and
network trafﬁc. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.
II. CACHE DISCOVERY WITH BREADCRUMBS
Breadcrumbs is used in the cache networks comprising
cache-capable routers. Routers can cache the forwarded
contents and record the trail information called Breadcrumbs
along the download path. And they can guide messages to
request contents (query) along the BC trail to the cached
contents. Cached contents are replaced based on the Least
Recently Used (LRU) policy when cache storage in a router
is exhausted. A BC entry includes following 5 information.
It is assumed that each content has global unique ID.
• Content ID
• ID of node from which the content arrived (Upstream
Node)
• ID of node to which the content was forwarded (Down-
stream Node)
• Most recent time the content passed through the node
(Download Time)
• Most recent time the content was requested at the node
(Request Time)
Fig.1 shows an example of the cache network. The
network consists of a contents server S1, three routers
R1˜R3 and two user nodes U1˜U2. The basic bahavior of
35

Breadcrums is explained with Fig.1. First, user U1 requests
content X. The query message sent by U1 reaches S1 via
R2 and R1 (dotted arrow in Fig.1 (a)). The contents server
S1 replies the data of content X to U1 via R1 and R2 (solid
arrow in Fig.1 (a)). While forwarding the content X, router
R1 and R2 cache the data and record the direction of the
download in BC. Upstream and Downstream nodes of BC
entries in R1 and R2 are (S1, R2), (R1, U1) respectively. A
router also records Download time and Request time in BC
entry.
Suppose that user U2 requests same content after R1
deleted it from cache storage. When the query sent by U2
reaches R1, R1 redirects the query to R2 because R1 has
no cache but the valid BC entry for the content X (dotted
arrow in Fig.1 (b-1) and (b-2)). BC entry becomes valid
only if the Download time is within Tf or the Request time
is within Tq. If the recorded time exceed such thresholds,
BC entry expires. When the query reaches R2, the cache
of content X in R2 is hit. Then R2 starts sending the
data to U2. There are two options for download path
to the requesting node. One is DFS (Download Follows
Query), which forwards the contents along the reverse path
of the query(solid arrow in Fig.1 (b-1)). Another one is
DFSP (Download Follows Shortest Path), which forwards
the contents through the shortest path from the contents
holder to the requesting node(solid arrow in Fig.1 (b-2)).
When the content is downloaded from R2 to U2, R1 and
R2 overwrite their BC entries and R3 creates new BC entry.
Upstream and Downstream node of BC entries in R2, R1
and R3 become (R1,R1), (R2,R3), (R1,U2) in DFQ case,
and (R1,R3), (S1,R2), (R2,U2) in DFSP case respectively.
If no caches exist along the BC trail, the query is forwarded
to S1 (dotted arrow in Fig.1 (c)). When R1 receives the
query from R2, R1 can recognize that no cache exists in the
direction of R2 anymore. Therefore R1 deletes the BC entry
for content X. While the content is downloaded from S1 to
U2 (solid arrow in Fig.1 (c)), R1 creates BC entry (S1,R3)
and R3 creates BC entry (R1,U2). R1 and R3 also create
cache of the content X.
III. EXTENSIONS OF BREADCRUMBS
A. Active Breadcrumbs
Active Breadcrumbs (ABC) is the extension of Bread-
crumbs proposed in [7]. With Breadcrumbs, routers always
overwrite BC entries to the newest direction of download.
Therefore if a content is downloaded from a node having
the cache, BC entries in its adjacent routers are overwritten
to the direction of download users. For example in Fig.2,
after User1 downloads a content from Server and User2
downloads it from User1, BC trail is formed like short
arrows in Fig.2. Therefore the query sent by User3 travels
a long trail along the dotted line. Even if the query passes
close to the server and User1 which have desired content, it
is redirected toward the further node User2. The objective

of ABC is to avoid such ineffective redirection of queries.
In addition, ABC can draw queries travling near the nodes
which have the contents cache even if no adjacent routers
have BC entries. As a result, ABC can improve cache hit
ratio and reduce the load of contents server. In Fig.2, suppose
that User1 distributes ABC to the adjacent router, the query
from User3 is guided to User1. So User3 can download
contents from User1. If User1 removed the contents from
its cache storage, it also invalidates ABC for the removed
contents. The range of distribution of ABC can be adaptively
determined in terms of contents popularity, load of the node
and so on.

Hierarchy of ASes
B. Hop-aware Breadcrumbs
Hop-aware Breadcrumbs (HBC) is proposed in [8]. As
same objective as ABC, HBC avoids redirection of queries
near the server to further node. HBC aims to decrease delay
of contents discovery. HBC extends BC entry to have the
download node in addition to the downstream node of BC
trail. A router compares hop count to the contents server
and that to download node. If contents server is closer than
the download node, the router ignores BC information and
forwards the query to the server direction.
C. BC Scoping
BC Scoping is proposed in [9]. BC Scoping assumes a
hierarchical structure of the network as shown in Fig.3. The
Internet consists of a large number of Autonomous Systems
(AS). ASes have vertical relations called Tier. Lower Tier
ASes have transit links to connect upper Tier ASes. When
lower ASes send or receive trafﬁc through the transit links,
they need to pay to upper ASes according to the amount of
trafﬁc. Transit cost per Mbyte in US was predicted $2.34
in 2012 [11]. Therefore it will be possible that lower ASes
reduce their transit cost with utilizing contents cache in their
own networks. In addition, when users can download desired
contents within the belonging AS, users have beneﬁts such
as faster download and so on. Since original BC doesn’t
take hierarchy of the network into consideration, queries
will be guided toward the different ASes via transit links.
BC Scoping permits only routers which belong to the same
ASes as the download user to create BC entries. This scheme
restricts inter-AS redirection of queries and increases cache
hit ratio within the same AS.
D. MSCR
Mapping Server with Cache-location Resolution (MSCR)
is proposed in [10]. With Breadcrumbs, it is necessary for
requesting users to know the location of contents server prior
to sending a query. MSCR assumes Mapping Server (MS)
which can provide server locations correspond to the content
IDs. Users who want some contents inquire contents server
information to MS. With MSCR, MS also keeps Prospective
Cache Location (PCL) in addition to the server locations.
PCL includes location of users who recently inquired the
server location, in other words, locations where desired
contents are potentially cached. When other user inquires
server location of the contents to MS, MS replies PCL
which is the closest to the user, too. The user puts the PCL
information to the query message. When a router receives
the query with PCL, the router forwards the query not toward
the contents server but toward the location where the PCL
indicates. If no caches exist on the way to the location, PCL
information is removed from the query message and the
query is forwarded toward the contents server. As a result,
since the users can get the contents from closer location,
network trafﬁc can be reduced. For the prototype used in
the evaluation, MS selects best PCL as the following priority
order.
1) PCL having the same domain which the requesting
user belongs to.
2) PCL having the location address which is longest-
matched with requesting user’s address.
3) PCL registered most recently.
E. Priority among extensions
Our prototype implemented above mentioned four exten-
sions based on Breadcrumbs. Because the four extensions
can be used simultaneously, routers may have several options
for query forwarding. Following is the order of priority for
routers to forward queries.
1) ABC: If there exists ABC, the query is forwarded by
ABC.
2) HBC: If valid HBC exists AND contents server is
closer than download node in HBC, query is forwarded
toward the server. If server is not closer, the query is
forwarded to the downstream node of HBC.
3) MSCR: If PCL exists in the query, the query is
forwarded toward the location indicated by PCL.
4) Otherwise the query is forwarded toward the contents
server.
IV. EVALUATION ENVIRONMENT
Breadcrumb-based contents distribution system was de-
veloped on Linux with C language. The system implements
basic Breadcrumbs and four extensions, i.e., ABC, HBC,
BC Scoping and MSCR. The structure of the system is
shown in Fig.4. Every router, user node and contents server
runs the contents distribution module. The system also has
a mapping server which provides location (i.e., IP address)
of cotents servers to users. All modules are implemented
as user level processes. All messages among processes are
deﬁned in XML.
In this evaluation, the performance metrics and network
trafﬁc were measured when plural extensions work at the
same time. 14 patterns in which more than one extensions
are used were compared with basic BC case. Measured

Evaluation Topology
metrics are cache hit ratio, query hop count, download hop
count, number of cache miss and average cache lifetime.
A topology used for the evaluation is shown in Fig.5. The
network consists of one contents server (CS), which has the
role of both mapping server and contents server, one core
router (CR), two border routers (BR1˜2) and four user nodes
(UN1˜4). There are three Autonomous Systems (AS) in the
network. It is assumed that AS1 is upper AS and AS2 and
AS3 are lower ASes. Two topologies with and without a
peer link between AS2 and AS3 were evaluated. All network
interfaces equiped in the nodes are FastEther (100Mbps).
Only routers can forward queries with BC. User nodes do
not create any BC entries. However user nodes can distribute
ABC when contents in its cache are hit. The range of ABC
distribution depends on the hit count of cached contents.
Because hit count is higher, the content is supposed to be
more popular. The pair of (Cache Hit Count, ABC TTL)
are set (1,1), (5,2), (10,3) in this evaluation. Contents data
are downloaded along the shortest path. Every router and

Total number of contents is 1000 and size of a content is
100Kbytes. The popularity of kth content p(k) is calculated
in eq.(1) as followed in Zipf distribution. In this experiment,

All user nodes send one query per second. Requested
contents are chosen with probability in proportional to p(k).
Becasue one trial lasts 1000 seconds, the number of total
reqeusts from all user nodes is 4000. Three trials were
performed and results are averaged. Parameters conﬁgured
for the evaluation are shown in Table I.
V. EVALUATION RESULTS
A. Performance of Contents Distribution
The results in the case using only basic BC are shown in
Table II. The results between topologies with and without
peer link have no big differences. Cache hit ratio is slightly
better than 36%. Query hop count is about 3.5, a little longer
than the hop count from user node to content server (3
hops). However, download hop count is around 2.2, shorter
than 3. It means that users can get the contents from closer
cache. Cache miss events happen more than 1500 times out
of 4000 requests. Each content cache can survive less than
10 secounds on average.
Compared with this basic BC results, Table III and IV
show increase or decrease percentage of the results for
combinations of extensions. The results in the topology with
peer link are shown in Table III, and those in the topology
without peer link are shown in Table IV. Shaded cells mean
degradation from basic BC results. Bold ﬁgures mean the
best results among the combinations. Same results regarding
each metric are also shown in Fig.6 ˜10. Circled bars in the
ﬁgures mean the best results.

1) cache hit ratio: The result of cache hit ratio in both
topologies are shown in Fig.6. As shown in Fig. 6, all
combinations of extensions do not signiﬁcantly improve
cache hit ratio. This is because the topolgy is almost tree
structure, the core router can surely redirect queries only
with basic BC. Since MSCR can guide queries to the region
in which ABC is locally distributed, the combination of
ABC and MSCR can improve cache hit ratio best. It can
be said that MSCR can enhance the beneﬁt of ABC. Since
the network is samll in this evaluation, synergy of ABC and
MSCR is limited. The beneﬁt of synergy between ABC and
MSCR will be more in larger networks. On the other hand,
BC Scoping and HBC worsen cache hit ratio compared with
basic BC. This is because both extensions will restrict query
redirection at the core router, so more queries tend to go to
the contents server. When ABC is used with HBC in the
topology with peer link, degradation of cache hit ratio can
be minimized with keeping shorter query and download hop
count. This is because ABC can redirect queries between
BRs directly via peer link only if cache in another BR is
available.

2) query hop count: Query hop count is related to the
time to ﬁnd contents. Shorter the query hop is, faster the
user can ﬁnd contents. According to Fig.7, thanks to the
restriction of redirection at CR, HBC and BC Scoping can
shorten query hop count by more than 20%. With using
only ABC or MSCR individually, reduction of query hop
count is limited. This is because the server is as close as
cache locations in BRs and UNs in the evaluation topology.
However, combination of ABC and HBC/BC Scoping can
enhance query hop reduction. This is because queries for
only popular contents are redirected between BRs by ABC,
but queries for less popular contents are not redirected
from CR to BRs due to BC Scoping or HBC. Therefore
combination of ABC and HBC/BC Scoping is good choice
to reduce query hop count with less degradation of cache
hit ratio.
3) download hop count: Download hop count is related
to both time to download contents and trafﬁc load in the

network. Shorter the download hop is, faster the user can
download contents, also lighter the trafﬁc load in the network
becomes. The results of increase or decrease of download
hops are shown in Fig.8. In case of the topology with peer
link, the combination of ABC and MSCR is best. ABC only
and ABC+HBC also marked good scores. It means that ABC
contributes downloading contents cache from BRs via peer
link. Furthermore, MSCR and ABC encourage download
between UNs in the same AS. Suppose that UN1 has a
content cache and distribute ABC to BR1. Even if BR1 has
no BC pointing to UN1, ABC in BR1 can guide queries
from UN2 to the cache-holding UN1. MSCR can also guide
queries directly to the neighbor UN in the same AS based on
the PCL given by MS. Hop count between UN1 and UN2 in
the same AS is only 1 hop. Therefore combination of ABC
and MSCR can reduce more download hop count than other
combinations in this topology. Unlike the case with peer link,
using all extensions can reduce download hop most in the
topology without peer link. When a UN downloads a content
from other UN in the different AS, hop count will be 4. Since
hop count from server to UN is 3, download between UN
in different ASes lengthen the download hop count. HBC
and BC Scoping can avoid such longer download path by
restricting queries to go to other AS. On the one hand, ABC
and MSCR help download between UNs in the same AS.
This synergy causes the best result in terms of download
hop reduction.
4) cache miss frequency: According to Table II, cache
miss events happen more than 1500 times for total 4000
queries. It means that cache storage size in routers and user
nodes are so small while BCs survive much longer than
cache lifetime. According to Fig.9, HBC and BC Scoping
can reduce cache miss event by around 40% because they
restrict query redirection from CR to BRs with BC. Owing
to the decrease of cache miss, useless forwarding of queries

are suppressed. As the result, total messages processed in the
network can be reduced by 7%. ABC reduces cache miss
because ABC can guide queries to surely existing cache.
When the cache in the node is removed, ABC distributed to
the adjacent nodes are also purged. Therefore ABC does not
worsen cache miss situation. Regarding MSCR, since PCL
in the MS is not related to the removal of cached contents,
MSCR is more prone to cache miss than ABC. In the
topology with peer link, ABC+HBC is the best combination
to minimize cache miss. This is because ABC can surely
ﬁnd cached contents via peer link, and HBC prevents unsure
redirection of query at CR. On the other hand, in the
topology without peer link, ABC+BC Scoping+MSCR is the
most effective. With MSCR, MS possibly gives PCL in same
AS as the requesting user. Therefore if neighbor UN in the
same AS doesn’t have the cached contents, a query merely
goes to BR. Since BC Scoping prevents CR from creating
BC, CR forwards queries to another AS with ABC only if
BR or UNs in another AS surely have cached contents.
5) cache lifetime: Because average cache lifetime shown
in Fig.10 is around 10 seconds, BC lifetime (Tf) should be
similar value as the cache lifetime. If BC lifetime is too
long, cache miss will happen more frequently. Conversely
BC lifetime is shorter than cache lifetime, cache hit ratio
must be degraded. However we cannot know the average
cache lifetime in advance and it will be changeable due
to many factors such as popularity of the contents, user
distribution, network topology, router capacity and so on.
Therefore how to decide optimal BC lifetime is still open
issue. Since ABC is distributed when the cache is hit in the
node, ABC will guide queries for popular contents and cache
of the popular contents can be used more frequently. As the
result, cache lifetime become longer when using ABC. In
the topology with peer link, the combination of ABC and
MSCR can prolong the cache lifetime most. While in the

topology without peer link, the lifetime is the longest when
using all extensions. Although cache hit ratio is degraded
in most combinations, cache lifetime becomes longer. Main
reason is that the cache in the BRs can survive longer. In
the topology without peer link, the cache lifetime in UNs
tend to be shorter. While in the topology with peer link, that
in the CR becomes shorter. However in both topologies, the
cache lifetime in BRs becomes longer by 6˜10%. If cache
lifetime becomes longer, it is expected that load to replace
cache in routers can be reduced.
B. Network trafﬁc
Total amount of network trafﬁc (Mbytes) are shown in
Table V when using basic BC individually. Core means
trafﬁc on the link between CR and contents server. Transit
means trafﬁc on the transit links between CR and BRs. Peer
means trafﬁc on the peer link between BRs. Intra means
trafﬁc within AS2 and AS3. Total is the trafﬁc throughout
the whole network. Total trafﬁc increases in case of no
peer link. This is becasue download across ASes travels two
transit links instead of the peer link.
For all combinations, relative amount of trafﬁc to basic
BC results as 100 are shown in Fig.11 and Fig.12.
1) The topology with peer link: From the viewpoint of
operators in lower Tier ASes, it is desirable that users (their
customers) can download contents within the AS or can
download from other ASes connected with a peer link.
According to Fig.11, it reveals that HBC can not utilize the
peer link at all. This result depends on the topology. Since

Relative trafﬁc in topology with a peer link
the contents server is closer than UNs from CR, HBC always
selects to forward queries toward the server in CR. Since
BC Scoping also prevents inter-AS download, it doesn’t
utilize peer link at all, too. In terms of the operation cost,
ABC+MSCR is the best combination becasue it can reduce
the transit trafﬁc most. This combination can also reduce
total trafﬁc most becasue download hop count is minimized
by exploiting the peer link.
2) The topology without peer link: As shown in Fig.12,
when using HBC or BC Scoping, more transit trafﬁc can
be reduced. This is because inter-AS download is restricted.
Instead, core trafﬁc increases becasue more users download
the contents from the server. BC Scoping+MSCR+HBC is
the best combination for the operators in lower ASes because
it can reduce tansit trafﬁc most. This combination is also
the best from global point of view becasue it can minimize
total trafﬁc. From viewpoint of core network operator,
ABC+MSCR is the best to reduce the most core network
trafﬁc. According to this observation, there is contradiction
between the beneﬁts of core network operator and lower
AS operators. Core network operators have no incentive to
use HBC and BC Scoping, because they want to minimize
trafﬁc in core network and maximize transit cost. Lower AS
operators want core network to use BC Scoping and HBC to
minimize transit cost. If each operator can conﬁgure which
extensions are used in thier routers independently, the beneﬁt
will be reduced. How to compromise the beneﬁt of operators
in different ASes and ﬁnd best mix of extensions for all
operators is the essential but difﬁcult issue.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, synergic effects among multiple extensions
of Breadcrumbs, which is the distributed mechanism to
discover cached contents in the networks were evaluated.
According to the evaluation results, ABC and MSCR can
improve cache hit ratio most regardless the existence of peer
links. In the topology with peer links, ABC and MSCR

Relative trafﬁc in topology without peer link
is also the best combination for both performance metrics
and network trafﬁc. If it is important to reduce control
messages, ABC and HBC is the best combination. In the
topology without peer links, using all extensions is the best
choice to improve performance metrics. From the viewpoint
of network trafﬁc, BC Scoping, HBC and MSCR is good
combination for lower AS operators.
Because these results fairly depend on the topologies used
in the evaluation, evaluation with larger networks will be
performed near future. It is also necessary to consider real
network scenario for applications of Breadcrumbs system.
Automatic BC lifetime adaptation scheme will be another
challenge to optimize performance of cache discovery with
BC.
