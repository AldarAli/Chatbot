 INTRODUCTION  
Current demands for highly miniaturized, small-volume 
detection platforms in basic biological research and clinical 
diagnosis underscore the importance of examining proteins 
on surfaces.  In comparison to liquid-phase protein assays, 
solid-phase sensors involving proteins on array or plate 
surfaces can be carried out using only a very small amount 
of assay agents.  Solid-phase approaches also enable rapid 
and simultaneous detection involving a large number of 
samples.  The use of surface-bound proteins in the form of 
microtiter plates, protein chips, and microwell plates for 
optical detection is routinely observed both in laboratory 
and clinical settings.  Material choice for these solid 
surfaces includes glass, nitrocellulose paper, gold, silicon, 
and polymer.  A large number of these protein assays, 
however, involves polymer-based platforms due to the wide 
range of polymeric materials that are available and also as a 
result of the flexibility in which their surface chemistry can 
be easily tailored for the immobilization of proteins.

PARALLEL AND SERIAL METHODS FOR PROTEIN 
ASSEMBLY 
Methods used to deliver and localize proteins on 
polymeric surfaces include manual and robotic delivery [1], 
microcontact printing [2-6], imprint- and nano-lithography 
[7-9], microfluidic channel networks [10-12], focused-ion-
beam patterning [13, 14], inkjet deposition [15, 16], dip-pen 
lithography and related scanning probe microscopies [2, 17-
19].  In a laboratory setting, simultaneous protein delivery is 
frequently 
carried 
out 
either 
manually 
by 
using 
commercially 
available 
multichannel 
pipettes 
or 
automatically by employing robotic protein spotters 
mounted with capillary print heads.   
In recent years, advances in the area of microfabriaction 
and nanofabrication have influenced protein delivery to 
surfaces.  Methods based on robotic printing, ink-jet 
printing, soft lithography, and microfluidic channel 
networks are used to produce micron-size protein patterns 
on surfaces.  These parallel approaches have the benefit of 
producing a large number of patterns simultaneously on 
surfaces and are applied as model systems to guide the study 
of biological systems.  However, the micrometer-scale 
resolution, typically achieved by these parallel approaches 
can often limit address density of proteins.   
Although microscale patterns of proteins are of great 
interest and application, the nanoscale size and structure of 
most proteins can be most aptly investigated through a 
nanoscale assembly of proteins.  Nanoscale protein patterns 
can be beneficial to the further miniaturization of detection 
platforms.  Dip-pen lithography and related scanning probe 
tip-based protein printing have been exploited to place 
proteins into nanometer scale areas on surfaces.  Such serial 
approaches, in which proteins are written line-by-line onto 
solid surfaces via probe tips, permit a nanoscale positional 
control and provide smaller feature sizes for proteins 
compared to the parallel methods such as microcontact 
printing and microchannel networks.  Despite the advantage, 
the practical application of these serial methods at large 
scales can be hampered by their low speed and time-
consuming production.     
Nanoscale assembly of proteins is also achieved by 
physical or chemical patterning of surfaces.  In the former 
method, substrate surfaces are modified to inscribe 
topological patterns for subsequent protein binding.  In the 
latter approach, selective sites of surfaces are chemically 
activated for subsequent protein attachment.  Methods such 
as laser ablation [20, 21], reactive ion etching [22], and 
sputtering [23, 24] have been used for the physical 
alterations of the solid surfaces.  Chemical patterning of 
substrates for protein adsorption has also been accomplished 
by the use of self-assembled monolayers [2, 25-29].  Despite 
these numerous efforts, significant challenges still exist in 
producing high-density, biologically active, surface-bound 
proteins rapidly at a large scale.

ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR PROTEIN SENSOR 
FABRICATION: NANOSCALE SELF ASSEMBLY 
Distinct from the protein assembly methods described 
above, a bottom-up approach has also been proven to be 
successful in creating surface-bound proteins at a large scale 
in a straightforward and convenient manner.  Self-assembly 
has been recently exploited to organize effectively proteins 
on nanoscale polymeric surfaces [30-34].  In these recent 
studies, both the underlying polymeric substrates as well as 
the proteins themselves are positioned via self-assembly 
where highly periodic and aligned patterns of proteins are 
instantaneously produced over a large area of substrates.   
A class of polymeric materials called diblock copolymers 
is known to provide chemically heterogeneous, self-
assembling 
surface 
structures 
through 
microphase 
separation.  Diblock copolymers are formed by covalently 
joining two, chemically-immiscible, polymer blocks end-to-
end.  Due to the immiscibility and differential wetting 
properties associated with the two components of these 
materials, 
microphase 
separation 
occurs 
in 
diblock 
copolymer thin films in directions both perpendicular and 
parallel to the underlying support substrate [35-38].  The 
unique microphase separation behavior of a block 
copolymer, polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-
b-PMMA), has previously been shown to expose both block 
components to the air/polymer interface under carefully 
balanced 
thermodynamic 
conditions 
[39]. 
 
This 
phenomenon generates spatially periodic, self-assembled, 
nanoscale polymeric domains consisting of the different 
chemical constituents of the two polymeric components, 
whose scale and geometry reflect the chemical and physical 
properties of the polymer [40-42].  Their phase diagram 
dictates the packing nature and orientation of the resulting 
polymer chains where their microphase separation behavior 
is predictable based on a mean field theory [35, 37].  
Therefore, the repeat spacing and surface geometry of the 
diblock copolymer can be controlled by changing the 
molecular weight and compositions of the two blocks.  
These chemically alternating and self-assembling polymeric 
domains can serve as convenient self-constructed templates 
for nanoscale arrangement of the desired biocomponents.  
Fig. 1 demonstrates some examples of such phase separating 
diblock copolymers which provide nanometer scale domains 
in their ultrathin films.   
Recently, preferential interaction of several model 
proteins with PS and their selective segregation on the PS 
regions were monitored on the surface of phase-separated, 
PS-b-PMMA diblock copolymer ultrathin films [31].  No 
proteins were found on the neighboring PMMA areas.  
Proteins 
showing 
this 
behavior 
include 
bovine 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 
conjugated anti-bovine IgG, and protein G.  When the 
protein loading condition was increased to a monolayer-
forming concentration, the proteins exhibited close-packing 
behavior where they self-assembled themselves in a closely 
packed configuration on the PS domain in order to avoid the 
neighboring PMMA domain.  In a follow-up study, protein 
adsorption experiments were carried out on both chemically 
homogeneous and heterogeneous supports, leading to the 
observation that protein density on the chemically 
heterogeneous PS-b-PMMA is larger than that on the 
chemically homogeneous, homopolymer surfaces of PS and 
PMMA by several fold [33].  They noted that more proteins 
adsorb on the diblock copolymer than on the PS or PMMA 
homopolymer, although approximately half of the exposed 
surface on the diblock copolymer consists of the non-
preferred PMMA domains.  The study concluded that the 
nanoscale 
chemical 
heterogeneity 
provided 
by 
the 
underlying PS-b-PMMA promotes protein adsorption more 
effectively than chemically homogeneous, homopolymer 
templates. 
In addition to these methods for arranging proteins into 
periodic, one-dimensional stripes, mimicking the spot layout 
of conventional protein arrays via two-dimensional protein 
assembly was accomplished by using micelle-forming 
diblock copolymers.  Amphiphilic polymeric systems such 
as 
polystyrene-b-polyacrylic 
acid, 
poly(ethylene-
propylene)-b-polyethylene oxide,  polystyrene-b-poly(2-
vinylpyridine) 
and 
polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) 
were extensively studied to understand their fascinating 
micellar properties and dependence on diblock copolymer 
characteristics [43-46].  Micellar assembly, above a critical 
polymer concentration, is a well known behavior of such 
amphiphilic diblock copolymers.  The exact structures and 
configurations of the resulting micelles or aggregates are 
length of each polymer segment, the polarity of the solvent,

and the relative solubility of each polymer block in the 
solvent.  
These amphiphilic diblock copolymers can serve as 
extremely useful guides in organizing biomolecules into 
two-dimensional arrays since they exhibit a rich spectrum of 
morphologies and their repeat spacings are tunable in two 
dimensions.  The advantages of amphiphilic diblock 
copolymers have been exploited to achieve rapid and large-
scale self-assembly of two-dimensionally controlled protein 
arrays with periodic repeat spacing in nanoscopic 
dimensions [30].  The study demonstrated that polystyrene-
b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-PVP) can be effectively used 
for the self-assembly of surface-bound, two-dimensional, 
nanoscale protein arrays.  The study also established a 
straightforward method to produce protein patterns of 
different geometries and sizes by successfully manipulating 
topological structures of the underlying PS-b-PVP templates 
via various chemical treatments.  Fig. 2 displays some 
examples of protein molecules arranged via self-assembly 
onto half cylinder- and micelle-forming diblock copolymer 
surfaces. 
IV. 
CURRENT CHALLENGES 
Ideal protein arrays for practical and clinically 
meaningful biosensing applications should be prepared for 
quantifiable, parallel, small-volume sensors that can be 
readily applied to large numbers of samples.  They should 
also feature a reliable placement of protein molecules in a 
well-defined, highly dense pattern, while fully retaining 
their native functionality.  Current challenges associated 
with the application of proteins printed on surfaces lie in the 
precise control over protein density, spot density, protein 
orientation, spotting uniformity, array standardization, array 
stability, 
surface 
fouling, 
and 
protein 
activity.  
Quantification of conventional assays, in which the exact 
number 
of 
biologically 
functional 
biomolecules 
participating in reactions can be easily and meaningfully 
compared between sensors, is also important but hard to 
achieve through conventional methods.   
To date, easy fabrication of regularly-spaced protein 
platforms displaying high areal density and natural protein 
conformation is still extremely challenging.  In addition to 
these general difficulties, inherent problems associated with 
manipulating small individual protein molecules on 
nanoscopic surfaces have restricted both the study and 
application of nanoscale protein arrays.  Therefore, 
concerted research efforts are highly warranted in the future 
to facilitate high density protein assembly and to promote a 
high 
level 
of 
protein 
activity 
on 
solid 
surfaces.  
Improvements are also needed in conventionally available 
methods of sample delivery and optical signal detection.  
The development of an automated sample handling system 
and novel detection techniques, capable of processing a 
picoliter (or smaller) reaction volume and overcoming the 
optical diffraction limit, is also warranted.  These advances 
will be particularly helpful to the application of the diblock 
copolymer-based nanoscale protein arrays in which the 
nanoscopic dimension of each spot in the sensor can be 
addressable as an independent detection unit.  
V. 
OUTLOOK AND SUMMARY 
Recent research efforts made in the areas of assembly, 
and applications of polymeric surface-bound proteins that 
are important both in sensor applications are considered in 
this article.  Various methods to assemble proteins on 
polymeric surfaces both at macro/micro- and nano-scale are 
discussed and compared to one another.  Current challenges 
and areas of further study are identified for the application 
of surface-bound proteins in the next-generation, solid-
phase detection.   
The presence of an underlying polymeric surface in solid-
phase protein platforms adds an additional degree of

complexity 
which 
necessitates 
more 
comprehensive, 
thorough, and systematic investigation in the identified 
areas of further study.  The significance of the polymeric 
surface-bound proteins in many important applications as 
gene chips, protein array sensors, and lab-on-a-chip devices 
warrants such future investigation.  Therefore, such efforts 
will be extremely beneficial to developing highly 
miniaturized, high density biosensors that also permit 
quantitative sensing of bioanalytes in a cost effective and 
straight forward manner.
