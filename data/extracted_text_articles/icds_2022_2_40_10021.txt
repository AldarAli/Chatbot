Review of Gestalt Principles used in Computer Games 
An Evaluation of Graphical User Interface Design 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abstract—Our goal in this paper is to review the use of 
Gestalt Principles in computer games. Our hypothesis is that 
Gestalt Principles can be used in games to improve user 
engagement with the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and this 
in turn affects User Experience (UX). First, we define the key 
elements of the Gestalt, as they apply to graphic design. Then, 
we demonstrate how Gestalt Principles are used in computer 
games and discuss how this may affect consumer behaviour 
and GUI design for games. 
Keywords - computer games; GUI design; Gestalt principles; 
user interface; analysis. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Consumer behaviour is associated with the study of 
consumers and their activities, associated with the purchase, 
use and disposal of goods and services. It is driven by how 
the consumer's emotions, attitudes and preferences affect 
buying behaviour. The Gestalt theory helps us to understand 
which visual elements are most effective in certain positions 
and how these cause behavioural changes in consumers, 
affecting primarily their perception and attention. 
Developed in the early twentieth century by the German 
psychologists, Wertheimer, Koffka and Kohler [4], the 
concept of Gestalt Principles began with a psychological 
study into vision; what the eye or the gaze perceives and 
comprehends about what it sees [1]. The discovery was that 
the brain’s natural tendency is to group smaller elements into 
a larger, more complete picture, to “find and create order” 
[2]. The overarching concept being that by reducing the sum 
of parts to a whole, we are producing an ultimate simplicity 
of form.  
The application to graphic design is that in visual 
communication we can direct the user or viewer to 
comprehend patterns of association - to take in and process 
hierarchies of information more easily - and therefore create 
an order of importance which allows for direct and simple 
understanding [5]. 
Gestalt Principles are incorporated as part of the overall 
design process in computer games, to assist the designer of 
GUI to simplify what could be quite complex informational 
structures, and thus improve the overall user experience of 
gameplay, by providing logical and rational visual choices 
for player direction and selections.  
The Gestalt Principles in design involve perceptions 
relating to space and form.  
We observe those visual relationships are based on the 
principles of: 
 
1. Proximity: space forms, or separates, groups 
2. Similarity: similar elements will form a group 
3. Common fate: change can occur as a group 
4. Figure/ground ambiguity: negative or positive space 
can be used to manipulate the eye 
5. Closure or continuation: of lines and structure – we 
close gaps in recognisable objects ourselves or are 
directed by repeated or continuous elements. 
 
Graphic designers take advantage of these visual 
comprehension tendencies, employing design strategies to 
incorporate them, such as:  
 
• 
reducing elements to basic shapes. 
• 
using positive and negative space, both foreground 
and background. 
• 
using pattern (or disruption of pattern). 
• 
using ‘the known’ to challenge the viewer to fill in 
missing information or identify shapes. 
• 
utilising 
grouping 
modes, 
which 
include 
simplicity, similarity, proximity, closure, continuity, 
and symmetry. 
 
Whilst analysis of Gestalt Principles as an element of 
graphic design for print and digital spaces are plentiful, 
investigations and evaluations for review or comparison into 
Gestalt Principles as a strategic approach for the unique, 
highly interactive nature of computer game GUI, were hard 
to come by, and have inspired this avenue of research. 
In Section II, we look further into the graphic design 
techniques used to apply Gestalt Principles. Grouping modes 
represent the strategy we use to incorporate the Gestalt into 
our designs, and we will examine the use of these modes in 
several computer games in Section III. A general analysis of 
Gestalt Principles in our selected GUI examples (Section IV) 
and the conclusions drawn from this (Section V), finalize this 
paper.  
II. 
GESTALT  PRINCIPLES: WHAT WE KNOW 
By grouping related elements into wholes, we target 
simplicity. This allows us to understand large tracts of data 
more easily. How we read a visual communication is

complex and involves appraisal of the visual hierarchy 
(setting an order of importance), including: viewing or 
reading patterns, such as in a ‘Z’ or ‘F’ pattern (Figure 1), 
graphic and typographic content, and narrative features [10].  
GUI is the interactive element of computer games. The 
GUI is the “arrangement of visual components that act as a 
means of communication between the user and various 
aspects of the game code, for example, in-game interactivity, 
information displays, narrative, and settings” [7]. 
   
 
Figure 1.  Patterns of viewing [10] 
The focus of graphic design in this setting is to design 
appropriately for the aesthetic and technical functions of the 
game design, as multiple user interface styles may be used 
within the one game. UI in games takes on different forms, 
such as diegetic, which involve elements that exist within the 
game world, or non-diegetic, referring to an on-screen UI 
element that is separate from the game world [11]. Other UI 
types are Meta, referring to elements which exist within the 
game world (and are used as a form of UI) and Spatial, 
which often appears as an element, or pop-up, appearing in 
the game but is not of the game world [7]. 
A. Reducing elements to basic shapes 
 
              
 
Figure 2.  Example of basic shapes 
In visual communication, we can reduce complex ideas 
into simple graphic representations (like Figure 2), by 
incorporating a type of ‘visual shorthand’, as in use of 
iconography and, more recently, ‘emoji’ [1]. 
Icons, like logos, are simple graphic devices that we infer 
with meaning, due to the associations we imply from the 
shapes used in construction of those elements. An example 
(Figure 3) shows male and female sides for the bathroom, 
and we understand (without any text to describe), which side 
is which based on shape alone. 
 
           
       
Figure 3.  Icons for male/female bathrooms [23]. 
Development of icons is an oft-used design tool, to cater 
toward simplicity of communication, and is indeed a 
universal language which crosses dialect and cultural barrier, 
not unlike use of colour, which can have some universal 
associations such as the red, green, and yellow of stoplights 
[3]. In computer games, too, we use icons and basic shapes 
to designate functions of UI, such as in Tool Bars or 
Backpacks, where multiple actions may be stored in shaped 
unit blocks, with basic icons inside (see Figure 11). 
B. Using positive and negative space 
According to Lupton and Phillips, Contrast plays a key 
role in the separation of “figures (forms) from the space, 
color or patterns that surround them” [2]. Using overlapping 
elements to create ambiguity as to the positioning of fore and 
background, the meaning or narrative within the negative or 
positive space created reveals itself, as in the example movie 
poster for “Brave,” by Pixar [12], in Figure 4. Here we can 
see both the figure of a girl with wild red hair on a black 
backdrop in the positive space or foreground, but also and a 
bear’s head in the negative, or background. This is a clever 
way of incorporating two perspectives of the same narrative.

C. Using pattern 
Pattern can manifest as both a behavioral, and graphic, 
occurrence. Certain repetitions of graphic may also prompt 
patterns in behaviour, encouraging players to do the same 
action or sequence of actions repeatedly. 
Patterns have power, both in terms of continuity and 
regularity of shape, but can also be dynamic. When a break 
in pattern occurs, a deliberate disruption of order is intended. 
Patterns can take many forms, as an aesthetic choice in a 
background, exampled by Figure 5 [15], or gameplay related, 
such as a pattern-based puzzle within a game (Figure 6) [21]. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Example of a literal Pattern in “Cozy Grove” by Spry Fox [15]. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Example of a puzzle Pattern in “Wolfenstein II:The New 
Colossus” by Bethedsa Softworks [21]. 
D. Using ‘the known’ 
Links and associations with known shapes and ideas 
allow the designer to use clever visual tricks, and 
combinations of concepts, to pull together multiple meanings 
into singular graphics. As noted with the design of icons or 
logos, we can reduce complexity by relying on pre-
conceived notions or visual memory. 
In the logo for “The Good Avocado,” Figure 7 [22], the 
designer has taken a universal symbol for good (an ‘OK’ 
hand gesture) and within the negative space created placed 
an ‘avocado’ shape. Because we know what an avocado 
looks like, our prior knowledge, we can make the appropriate 
association.

E. Utilising grouping modes 
As mentioned in Section I, the main grouping modes for 
Gestalt Principles are: 
 
• 
Proximity  
• 
Similarity 
• 
Symmetry  
• 
Simplicity 
• 
Continuity 
• 
Closure 
 
The natural tendency of the mind to group and structure 
complex objects or even concepts back to simplicity, give us 
the ability to demonstrate these groupings easily in most 
design settings, including computer game UI. We will 
explore this in Section III. 
 
III. 
AN ANALYSIS OF GESTALT PRINCIPLES IN GAMES 
USING GROUPING MODES 
 
How do Gestalt Principles affect the design of UI? It is 
worthwhile examining a small selection of games with 
different visual layouts to identify where these principles 
exist and how they are beneficial to design. 
Modes of grouping are a useful way to address how 
Gestalt Principles interact with the user in a games format –
and here we discuss where in the GUI of a game these 
principles can be clearly seen in action. 
A. Proximity 
Proximity is used as a design strategy, to position 
elements in such a way that they, due to their location in 
relation to other elements, become related – and thus are 
grouped together. Proximity is a tool used by designers to 
develop hierarchical forms, be they graphic or typographic.  
30

ICDS 2022 : The Sixteenth International Conference on Digital Society

This connected spatial relationship allows the viewer or 
user to identify where elements belong and direct the eye or 
“gaze” (Lupton, 2015), as seen in Fig8. Proximity is one of 
the most widely used Gestalt Principles in games, as the 
interactive nature of the medium makes it crucial to give 
swift and easy visual access to UI tools, and information, 
therefore the creation of relationships through Proximity 
assists with this. The limited screen area also dictates the 
placement and size of these elements, along with the genre 
and style of game.  
 
         
 
Figure 8.  Example of Proximity  
In the example (given in Figure 9), from “A Total War 
Saga: Troy”, by Creative Assembly Sofia (2020), we note 
the Skill Tree elements are all round, and the same size, but 
divided into five separate areas of Skill.  
 
 
Figure 9.  Example of Proximity, “A Total War Saga: Troy” [17]. 
Proximity links the Skill sets, but also separates them - as 
the proximity distance is increased between sets but 
decreased between individual circles – to connect them 
together, along with their paths, and create specific groups. 
With the box element encasing these shapes, we can 
clearly perceive a set of five different Skill Trees, related but 
separate. 
B. Similarity 
Our viewing patterns tend toward creating order, to 
organize concepts in a rational way, and group what we see. 
In this example (Figure 10), the similarity of the objects 
allows us to create two distinct groups (circles and squares). 
This, like Proximity, also plays to maintaining simplicity 
(another grouping mode) of form, and designers use this 
principle to link graphic representations. 
 
         
 
Figure 10.  Example of Similarity  
As this concept applies to game UI, we often see similar 
shapes repeated throughout to indicate specific information 
or apply hierarchy. 
 In the example from “Cozy Grove,” (Figure 11) by Spry 
Fox, the small, rounded squares all contain icons related to 
collected objects, acquired skills or inventory in some way. 
Our eye recognizes these shapes as belonging to the content 
system of the game, as the same forms are repeated for like-
structures relating to the character played (such as the 
Backpack, Weapons or Skills, Inventory, Chests).  
Colour, here, also plays a part, indicating a specific 
informational hierarchy. This can be seen from the use of a 
pop colour (jade green), which draws the eye to the icons, 
encouraging us to click and reveal the objects within.

C. Symmetry 
Creating balance in a design is often the function of 
Symmetry (see Figure 12). Symmetry gives rest to the eye 
and where asymmetry challenges and provides dynamic 
differentiation, symmetry balances with a certain neutrality. 
 
      
    
Figure 12.  Example of Symmetry  
Figure 13, the “Fortnite” UI, by Epic Games [18] shows 
a central character, with symmetrical UI elements of text and 
image on either side. Whilst content may vary, the space 
allowed - using a grid or column system - is clearly designed 
to show symmetry (and thus balance the visual). 
 
     
 
Figure 13.  Example of Symmetry from “Fortnite” by Epic Games [18]. 
D.  Simplicity 
The goal of creating a great game UI is to communicate 
all necessary information to the user or player in the clearest 
and simplest of terms, appropriately and in keeping with the 
mood and style of the game. 
Simplicity of communication in a game UI, could be 
utilizing iconography to interpret specific information, such 
as in the following level map from “Anthem,” (Figure 15) by 
Bioware [13] and as such, reducing elements to basic shapes 
(Figure 16).  
 
Figure 14.  Example of Simplicity  
Simplicity, in terms of use of space, is also a factor in UI 
design, keeping the playing area clear and tools accessible, as 
demonstrated in a padlock input execution (Figure 17), in 
“Firewatch”, by Campo Santo [15]. Here we see an expanse 
of unencumbered screen space, drawing our attention to the 
minimalist design elements of simple linework icons and 
text. This serves to shift the eye of the player to the desired 
UI features and perceive immediately how they are to 
interact with them (use the ‘up’ or ‘down’ icons, to achieve 
the correct number combination).

“Anthem” by Bioware games [13].

“Anthem” by Bioware games [13]. 
 
 
Figure 17.  Example of Simplicity, UI text and icon elements in 
“Firewatch” by Campo Santo [15]. 
E. Continuity 
According to Graham [4], the eye looks for relationships, 
through the space between elements, thus “continuation 
occurs when the eye follows along a line, curve, or a 
sequence of shapes” as seen in Figure 18. A designer can 
facilitate this in several ways, from linework or animations to 
direct the gaze, or harnessing Proximity in tandem to bounce 
the eye from shape to shape, colour to colour.  
 
      
 
Figure 18.  Example of Continuity 
Graham also points to the nature of time as being relevant 
here, as a flow of information or communication based on 
visual elements shows a certain progression [4]. Figure 19 is 
an example of a continuous line, where the driver can follow 
a line of ‘best fit’ for the roads or tracks available [20]. 
 
 
 
Figure 19.  Example of Continuity, showing a blue, continuous driving line 
(arrows) from “Forza Horizon 5”, by Playground games [20]. 
F. Closure 
The title screen from “Anthem,” (Figure 20) by Bioware 
games [13] is a classic example of how the mind perceives 
Closure. We know the name of the game, and despite the 
elements placed in the way of our visual comprehension of 
the word, “Anthem,” we are still able to complete the 
association. Our minds close the open letters (such as the A) 
and fill in the blanks of information we do not have (such as 
the incomplete M, E or H).

Figure 20.  Example of Closure from “Anthem” logo, Bioware games [13]. 
Closure also comes to the fore in UI, where a sense of 
time or completion need to be visualized, a notable example 
of which is present in the loading icon for “Darksiders” 
(Figure 21) by Vigil/Gunfire Games [14]. The icon is 
circular in nature, a commonly used structure for time-based 
animations (as the progression can continue seamlessly in a 
circular device). We know, however, that this progression 
must end, or close, for us to move forward in the game, so 
our eye is anticipating this occurrence. 
 
 
Figure 21.  Example of Closure from “Darksiders” loading icon 
byVigil/Gunfire games [14]. 
A similar circular graphic animation, indicating loading 
time, can be seen in a game for mobile/tablet, “Animal 
Crossing: Pocket Camp” (Figure 22) by Nintendo [19]. The 
UI analysed also includes a download bar with a similar 
Closure-based principle – in this graphic we await the end of 
the download, and finalization of loading.

ND Cube/Nintendo, download bar [19]. 
IV. 
ANALYSIS OF GESTALT PRINCIPLES AS UTILISED IN 
GAME UI 
The UI of a computer game is an informational, directive 
and interactive action tool. Unlike the design for a logo or 
magazine spread, the utilitarian nature of such a digital, user-
based design necessitates clear and swift communication of 
information, logical placements, and proximities – and thus 
the appropriateness of incorporating some aspects of Gestalt 
Principles in design (those which require deciphering or 
complicate the overall navigation) may be undesirable. 
A. Underutlised  Gestalt Principles in computer game GUI 
1) Figure/Ground Ambiguity: We may see this principle 
used for in-game design (where heavy contrast may be 
needed, or in animations or graphic designs in the game 
environment), or utilised as a design device in marketing for 
games, but it could be argued that creating ambiguity is not 
a goal of UI design.  
Dynamics, it could be argued, should give way to 
symmetry, legibility, and clarity and, in an overall sense, a 
more utilitarian design response which puts direct 
communication to the fore to enhance comprehension.

B. Review of Gestalt Principles in computer game GUI 
Computer games are a media in which the principles of 
the Gestalt, as applied to GUI graphic design, can be easily 
observed. Indeed, the interactions required of the user 
demand we consider the visual perceptions, prior knowledge, 
and diverse ways of seeing of the player. 
1) Proximity: 
Establishing 
relationships 
between 
elements is the goal of Proximity, and our analysis reflects 
this, with many games using this principle to link (or 
separate) graphic elements.  
2) Similarity: This principle exists throughout game UI 
in general, as similarity is one of the key visual touchpoints 
for recognition and therefore response. If simplicity is the 
goal of an effective UI (to promote clarity and 
functionality), the use of shape and colour works to not only 
differentiate, but allow navigation through like objects as 
well. 
3) Common fate: Elements regularly used in computer 
games such as directional menus or sub-menus demonstrate 
this principle by continually opening or tracking in the same 
direction and ending when the desired outcome is reached. 
Elements of Continuation also exist in this Gestalt Principle, 
as often a Continuous line will have sections repeating to 
the same end (Figure 19). 
4) Figure/ground ambiguity: This principle applies less 
to GUI design than it does to the brand and marketing of 
games, such as in logo design, where mood and graphic 
creativity are necessary to attract attention and differentiate 
through contrasts and clever manipultion of forms. Elements 
containing or displaying overt ambiguities are less 
functional, and therefore could cause confusion in the UI 
space. 
5) Closure or continuation: Closure, again, relates more 
to static logo designs traditionally, but could be seen to be 
used in any progress-related element which necessitates an 
end point, such as a progress bar or loading icon (Figure 
22), as our eye naturally seeks to close or end sequences [8]. 
Continuation can be seen in linework, colour referencing 
and animations throughout UI spaces [4], sometimes even 
within gameplay, along with patterns or animated elements 
which loop or run parallel to the action (as in Figure 19). 
  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
    Gestalt Principles have long been recognized around 
interactive media and User Experience (UX) [6], as being a 
product of psychological reaction to, and perception of, how 
a game functions or is designed [4]. This paper, however, 
has presented a brief analysis of how Gestalt Principles, as 
applied through the lens of graphic design in game GUI, are 
used within that sphere to influence and engage the user 
from a practical standpoint. This analysis suggests that 
Gestalt Principles are certainly a part of the overall UI 
design response, utilizing the knowledge gained through 
established “ways of seeing” [2] – from use of Simplicity to 
create clear and easily understood graphics in an inventory, 
to Proximity to establish navigation routes through a 
complex talent or Skill Tree. UI design, and therefore the 
user or player at large, can benefit from the application and 
assessment of these basic principles. 
    The strength of the Gestalt theory lies in its ability to 
provide support to marketing and graphic design activities, 
by providing more engaging content that stimulates the user 
attention and perception [9]. In this paper, we have 
demonstrated how Gestalt principles are applied to GUIs in 
games. In future studies, we plan to investigate the 
relationships between Gestalt principles in game GUIs and 
the game’s commercial success, by doing a market analysis.
