Abstract— Online review comments have become a popular 
and efficient way for sellers to acquire feedback from 
customers and improve their service quality. These online 
reviews in the e-tourism era, in the format of both textual 
reviews (comments) and ratings, generate an electronic Word 
Of Mouth (eWOM) effect, which influences future customer 
demand and hotels’ financial performance, and thus, have 
significant business value. This paper proposes an approach 
for hotel quality evaluation according to online review 
comments and ratings using Fuzzy String Matching (FSM) for 
mining customers’ opinions and Bayesian Belief Networks 
(BBN) for evaluating the attributes that contribute to the 
review rating. The proposed approach was applied to a dataset 
from TripAdvisor. The results show that the proposed 
approach is able to model the complex dynamics of online hotel 
review data, which are derived from both the textual nature of 
the review comments and the uncertain relationships between 
these comments and the review rating.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Online comments have become a popular and efficient 
way for sellers to acquire feedback from customers and 
improve their service quality [1]. According to a survey, with 
the increased popularity of online bookings, 53% of 
travellers state that they would be unwilling to book a hotel 
that had no reviews, while a 10% increase in travel review 
ratings would increase bookings by more than 5% [2]. 
Customer online reviews of hotels have significant business 
value in the e-commerce and big data era, while they affect 
room occupancy [3], revenue, prices [4] and market share 
[5]. These online reviews in the e-tourism era, in the format 
of both textual reviews (comments) and ratings, generate an 
electronic Word Of Mouth (eWOM) effect, which influences 
future customer demand and hotels’ financial performance 
[6]. 
Hotel owners want to know the details about hotel 
guests’ experiences, to improve the corresponding product 
and service attributes, and customers’ overall evaluation of 
the hotel stay experience, to obtain a snapshot of the hotel’s 
operational performance and overall customer satisfaction 
[7][8]. Although the direct measurement of customer ratings 
in terms of closed-ended survey questions can show overall 
customer satisfaction in a direct way [7][8], they suffer from 
confounding the data of customers’ true evaluation because 
of variations in survey design from different approaches [9].  
Recently, many studies have focused on textual reviews 
[8][10]. In contrast to a pre-designed questionnaire survey, 
online textual reviews have an open-structured form and can 
show customer consumption experiences, highlight the 
product and service attributes customers care about, and 
provide customers’ perceptions in a detailed way through the 
open-structure form [8]. The provided information is free 
from obvious bias and is helpful in understanding and 
assessing hotel performance [11]. In addition, such 
information is inexpensive and efficient to collect [12]. 
However, the exploitation of online textual reviews is still 
largely underexplored [8], while there is a lack of advanced 
data analytics approaches and algorithms for modeling 
complex dynamics of online hotel review data. 
Hotel quality evaluation from online reviews is an 
emerging research field; however, the vast majority of 
existing research works have been performed from a tourism 
management perspective. Therefore, the applied methods 
and algorithms are limited to descriptive statistics, e.g., using 
well-established regression models. However, the increasing 
amount of online reviews as the core means for customers to 
express their level of satisfaction about a hotel pose 
significant challenges to the data analytics and computer 
science community for the development of advanced data 
analytics models aiming at providing a higher level of 
intelligence and thus, increased business value. 
In this paper, we propose an approach for hotel quality 
evaluation from online reviews using Fuzzy String Matching 
(FPM) and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). The objective 
is to provide a unified algorithm, which both: (i) mines 
customers’ opinions from online hotel reviews (review 
comments and rating); and, (ii) evaluates the hotel 
performance by identifying how the various attributes (e.g., 
location, cleanliness, breakfast, etc.) affect the overall review 
rating. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 
II presents the related work on methods and approaches for 
hotel evaluation based on online review comments. Section 
III describes the research methodology and the proposed 
approach for hotel quality evaluation from online reviews 
using FSM and BBN. Section IV presents the results from

the adoption of the proposed methodology on a dataset from 
TripAdvisor. Section V concludes the paper and outlines our 
plans for future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The business value of online consumer reviews has 
emerged in recent year in the hotel industry aiming at solving 
the problems confronted by the traditional hotel service 
quality assessment methods [13]. For example, Kim and 
Park [14] performed hierarchical multiple regressions in 
order to examine the effects of traditional customer 
satisfaction relative magnitude and social media review 
ratings on hotel performance and found that social media 
review rating is a more significant predictor. In the 
traditional hotel quality assessment, domain experts or 
customers are asked to fill in a questionnaire and score each 
evaluation index to be used in a service quality assessment 
model [15]-[17].  On the contrary, online comments are 
made by a large amount of customers with actual user 
experience shortly after the consumption is completed. In 
addition, the increasing amount of reviews-related data pave 
the way for the use of advanced data analytics and machine 
learning algorithms that outperform traditional statistical 
methods based on sampling [2]. 
Technical attributes of online textual reviews can explain 
significant variations in customer ratings and can have a 
significant effect on customer ratings [18][19]. In this 
direction, Zhao et al. [8] developed an approach for 
predicting overall customer satisfaction using the technical 
attributes of online textual reviews and customers’ 
involvement in the review community. They calculated 
subjectivity and polarity measurements by using naïve Bayes 
classifier and sentiment analysis. Berezina et al. [10] 
investigated the underpinnings of satisfied and unsatisfied 
customers by applying text mining on online reviews.  
The literature is rich of methodologies based on 
descriptive statistics aiming at providing insights on hotel 
quality performance for various datasets. Xie et al. [20] 
applied statistical methods in order to assess how several 
characteristics, such as timeliness of the response, length of 
the response, number of responses, etc., contributes to the 
hotel’s financial performance. Figini et al. [21] compared the 
rating dynamics of the same hotels in two online review 
platforms, which mainly differ in requiring or not requiring 
proof of prior reservation before posting a review 
(respectively, a verified vs a non-verified platform). Xie et 
al. [22] examined the effect of factors of online consumer 
review, including quality, quantity, consistency, on the 
offline hotel occupancy (i.e., how popular the hotel is among 
consumers). 
De Pelsmacker et al. [3], the extent to which digital 
marketing strategies influence hotel room occupancy and 
revenue per available room and how this mechanism is 
different for different types of hotels in terms of star rating 
and independent versus chain hotels was investigated. Li et 
al. [23] examined the determinants of customer satisfaction 
in hospitality venues through an analysis of online reviews 
using text mining and content analysis. Zhao et al. [24] 
investigated the impacts of online review and source features 
(usefulness, reviewer expertise, timeliness, volume, valence 
and comprehensiveness) upon travelers’ online hotel 
booking intentions by applying factor analysis and regression 
analysis. Zhou et al. [11] compared customer satisfaction by 
classifying 
several 
attributes 
influencing 
customer 
satisfaction in: satisfiers, dissatisfiers, bidirectional forces, 
and neutrals. Ye and Yu [25] applied qualitative research 
methods and extracted six main factors influencing the 
positive or negative emotions of the comments of travelers 
staying in the hotel.  
Radojevic et al. [26] conducted a multilevel analysis of 
factors affecting customer satisfaction, such as service 
encounter, 
visitor, 
visitor’s 
nationality, 
hotel, 
and 
destination. Nunkoo et al. [27] applied a multi-group analysis 
and an importance-performance map analysis by means of 
Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-
SEM) in order to differentiate between service quality 
performance scores and their influences on customer 
satisfaction across accommodation with a different star 
grading. Schuckert et al. [28] assessed social media content 
produced by customers and related review-management 
strategies of domestic and international hotel chains with the 
use of multilevel regression.  
As mentioned earlier, the increasing amounts of reviews-
related data require advanced data analytics and machine 
learning methods for exploiting the full potential. To this 
end, Sánchez-Franco et al. [2] assessed whether terms related 
to guest experience can be used to identify ways to enhance 
hospitality services. They developed a model based on naïve 
Bayes classifier in order process vast amount of data and to 
classify reviews of hotels. Ku et al. [29] developed a 
framework in order to integrate visual analytics and (deep) 
machine learning techniques, such as clustering for text 
classification and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to 
investigate whether hotel managers respond to positive and 
negative reviews differently and how to use a deep learning 
approach to prioritize responses. Reference [1] combined 
fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and fuzzy cognitive maps 
aiming at identifying the causal relations among evaluation 
indexes from online comments. Based on this, their proposed 
approach recommends more economical solutions for 
improving the service quality by automatically getting more 
trustworthy evaluation from a large amount of less 
trustworthy online comments. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
Our research methodology consists of four main steps: (i) 
Extracting the evaluation criteria from online comments; (ii) 
Mining customers’ opinions using FSM; (iii) Assignment of 
sentiment scores to a discrete scale; and, (iv) Applying BBN 
for assessing the impact of hotel services to the customer 
rating. These steps are described in detail in the following 
sub-sections. 
A. Extracting the Evaluation Criteria from Online 
Comments 
The proposed approach utilizes three fields from the 
online hotel reviews: (i) review title; (ii) review comments; 
25

and, (iii) review rating. This step of the methodology 
processes the review title and the review comments in order 
to extract the evaluation criteria from the online comments. 
More specifically, based upon an evaluation index for hotel 
service quality [1], this step identifies the criteria mentioned 
in the hotel reviews under examination, e.g., location, price, 
breakfast, room space, etc. In this way, the criteria are 
defined dynamically out of the pre-defined list, according to 
the dataset of the available online comments. The extracted 
evaluation criteria are further processed with the use of 
Fuzzy Pattern Match Template (FPMT), as we describe in 
Section III.B. Moreover, along with the review rating, they 
derive the parent nodes of the BBN, as we describe in 
Section III.C and Section III.D. 
B. Mining Customers’ Opinions Using Fuzzy String 
Matching 
Since online comments are written in natural and 
informal language, there is the need to mine customers’ 
opinions so that they subsequently feed into the BBN for 
further processing. FSM, alternatively mentioned as fuzzy 
string searching or approximate string matching, has been 
developed in the framework of fuzzy set and possibility 
theory in order to take into account the imprecision and the 
uncertainty pervading values, which have to be compared in 
a matching process [30]. This technique has proved effective 
for implementing patterns of approximate reasoning in 
expert system inference engines, and for designing retrieval 
systems capable of managing incomplete and fuzzy 
information data bases and vague queries.  
In online review comments, different customers may use 
different words or phrases to express their opinions, while 
the comments may be vague. For example, poor cleanliness 
can be expressed as: “The room was too dirty”, “Very dirty”, 
etc. Regular expression is an efficient pattern match [31] 
technology to identify the specific pattern strings from a long 
text. 
A 
simple 
example 
of regular expression is 
“[\s\S]∗?[room|bathroom][\s\S]∗?dirty[\s\S]∗?” 
that 
can 
match “The room was too dirty.” However, the regular 
expression method causes a binary value result: match or not 
match. 
In the proposed approach, we apply FPMT [1] as an 
effective fuzzy string matching method to deal with the 
vagueness of the free text online comments. FPMT is a set of 
pattern strings with membership degrees, denoted as:  
FPMT = {(p1, w1), (p2, w2), …, (pi, wi), …, (pn, wn)} 
where pi is a pattern string described by regular expression, 
and wi is the membership degree that a string falls into the 
object FPMT when the string matches pi. When a string 
matches multiple pattern strings at the same time, the max 
membership degree of these pattern strings will be selected 
as the final membership degree. Although this method results 
in some mismatched cases due to the limitation of pattern 
strings, this causes little impact on the final result, because 
there are many redundant comments with similar semantics. 
The output of customers’ opinions mining is a fuzzy 
evaluation of the extracted criteria. Specifically, first, the 
extracted evaluation criteria of hotel quality are assigned to a 
five-level Likert scale (1 – Very Low, 2 – Low, 3- Neutral, 4 
– High, 5 – Very High), which serve as an equivalent to 
responses of a Likert scale questionnaire. Then, following 
the approach proposed by [32], this step considers the 
median of the resulting responses in order to represent the 
magnitude of causality among the evaluation criteria to be 
used as FCM concepts in Section III.C.  
C. Assignment of  Sentiment Scores to a Discrete Scale 
In this step, the sentiment scores extracted from the 
previous step for each criterion are assigned to a discrete 
scale consisting of ranges of sentiment score values. The 
number of the scale items should be the same with the 
respective scale of the review rating so that they are directly 
comparable. For example, if the review rating takes values 
between 1 and 5 (which is the most common case), the 
sentiment scores are classified to a respective discrete scale: 
• 
[-1, -0.6] is assigned to “DISASTER” 
• 
(-0.6, -0.2] is assigned to “MANY THINGS 
NEED TO BE IMPROVED” 
• 
(-0.2, +0.2] is assigned to “FAIR ENOUGH” 
• 
(+0.2, +0.6] is assigned to “PERFECT” 
• 
(+0.6, +1] is assigned to “ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT” 
D. Applying Bayesian Belief Networks for Assessing the 
Impact of Hotel Services to the Customer Rating 
 
In this step, the relationships between the sentiment 
discrete scale created in the previous step and the review 
rating of the customer are modelled in a probabilistic model 
with the use of BBN. A BBN is a powerful tool for 
knowledge representation and reasoning under conditions of 
uncertainty 
and 
visually 
presents 
the 
probabilistic 
relationships among a set of variables [32]. A BBN has many 
advantages, such as combination of different sources of 
knowledge, explicit treatment of uncertainty and support for 
decision analysis, and fast responses.  
More formally, BBNs are directed acyclic graphs whose 
nodes represent random variables from the domain of 
interest, in the Bayesian sense. Therefore, a BN is defined as 
a pair B = (G, Θ). G = (V, E) is a Directed Acyclic Graph 
(DAG) where V = {v1, …, vn} is a collection of n nodes, E ⸦ 
V × V a collection of edges and a set of parameters Θ 
containing all the Conditional Probabilities (CP) of the 
network.  
Each node v ϵ V of the graph represents a random 
variable XV with a state space XV which can be either discrete 
or continuous. An edge (vi, vj) ϵ E represents the conditional 
dependence between two nodes vi, vj ϵ V where vi is the 
parent of child vj. If two nodes are not connected by an edge, 
they are conditional independent. Because a node can have 
more than one parent, let πv be the set of parents for a node v 
ϵ V. Therefore, each random variable is independent of all 
nodes V \ πv. For each node, a Conditional Probability Table 
(CPT) contains the CP distribution with parameters θxi|πi 
26

:=P(xi|πi) ϵ Θ for each realization xi of Xi conditioned on πi. 
The joint probability distribution over V is visualized by the 
BN and can be defined as  
 
 
(1) 
The outcome indicates the probability of having a specific 
value of the overall rating given the values of different 
services (criteria). The user is able to perform queries in 
order to assess the impact of each criterion on the review 
rating, but also combinations of criteria. 
IV. 
RESULTS  
The proposed methodology was applied to a dataset from 
TripAdvisor. The nodes of the BBN are shown in Table I. 
These nodes represent the parent nodes derived from the 
extracted evaluation criteria from FPMT (C1-C9) along with 
the review rating (C10), which constitutes the unique child 
node of the BBN.

After the fuzzy evaluation of the aforementioned criteria 
for each hotel, the BBN is created. The BBN consists of two 
conceptual layers: the upper layer includes all the evaluation 
criteria (C1-C9) and the bottom layer includes the review 
rating provided by the customer (C10). The structure of the 
BBN is depicted in Figure 1. All the parent nodes are linked 
to the child node. Based upon this structure, the CPT is 
calculated for each node. Based upon this structure, the 
parameters of the BBN are learned.  
Upon queries, the Conditional Probability (CP) P(C10|Ci) 
is calculated. Table II presents the results from some 
indicative queries. In addition, the queries may deal with 
specific evaluation criteria in order to assess their impact on 
the customers’ overall review rating. According to the 
queries, the BBN derives more focused results, e.g., for a 
specific hotel, group of hotels, location, etc. Finally, the 
adopted modelling approach may serve as a classifier for 
predicting the review rating of a customer based upon their 
review comments. Table III presents the resulting confusion 
matrix that derives the precision and recall of the classifier as 
follows:

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Hotel quality evaluation from online reviews is an 
emerging research field, while the use of data analytics and 
machine learning methods are able to exploit its full potential 
in an e-tourism context. This paper proposed an approach for 
hotel quality evaluation according to online review 
comments and ratings using FSM for mining customers’ 
opinions and BBN for evaluating the attributes that 
contribute to the review rating. The results show that the 
proposed approach is able to model the complex dynamics of 
online hotel review data, which are derived from both the 
textual nature of the review comments and the uncertain 
relationships between these comments and the review rating.  
Regarding our future work, we plan to apply our 
methodology to further datasets, i.e. from different e-tourism 
platforms with different data structure and availability, and 
to investigate the role of user profiling in hotel selection. 
Moreover, we plan to investigate and develop approaches for 
detecting the fake reviews in order to increase the accuracy 
and the reliability of the sentiment analysis methods and 
algorithms.
