Abstract— Organizing conferences requires the consideration 
of several aspects, such as the choice of the most appropriate 
platform to manage the received papers or the conference 
location, among others. To this goal, we are going to compare 
some of the most important review platforms, which allow us 
to host our conferences. In recent years,new systems based on 
software applications have emerged. This software can be 
downloaded from the developer websites. These give us more 
options to choose from. Keeping in mind some of the most 
important review platforms, we are going to compare the 
services that each one offers, as well as their advantages and 
disadvantages. In addition, we are going to show several 
statistics about the use of these platforms during recent years. 
This work can help the conference organizers choose the most 
appropriate platform to manage their conference.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
In the beginnings of conferences, when authors wanted to 
submit a paper to a conference, they had to send it by 
ordinary postal service or airmail services. After the review 
process, the paper and the reviewers' comments were 
returned to the author. Before the deadline, authors had to 
make the corrections to their papers and send them again to 
the conference manager. While the papers were traveling, the 
authors expected that papers and reviews were not lost 
during the shipment. This method was expensive and it 
consumed a lot of time. Furthermore, it was difficult to track 
lost or delayed papers [1]. 
When the use of computers was more common among 
the population and especially in universities and research 
centers, the sending of documents in paper decreased. 
Instead, the authors sent their work on magnetic supports as 
floppy disks [2]. The appearance of electronic mail (e-mail) 
and the extension of its use facilitated several aspects in the 
organization of conferences. This method improved the 
process of paper submissions and the revisions of papers. It 
also saved time and money. However, it was still laborious 
to organize and distribute the papers to the reviewers [1]. 
Finally, the development of online web-based systems 
has made even easier the organization of conferences. 
Authors and reviewers are now able to track their papers’ 
progress anytime and anywhere, if they have Internet 
connection.  
In addition, the conference Chair can efficiently manage 
a lot of papers and reviews, as well as respond to comments 
and complaints from the authors [1]. 
Since the apparition of web-based services, scientific 
communities 
have 
established 
several 
policies 
and 
mechanisms 
to 
implement 
electronic 
conference 
management. The main reason of these is to reduce the 
operational and communication costs without reducing the 
high quality of the revision process. It should also maintain 
the fairness in the evaluation process [3]. 
Nowadays, there exist a lot of web-based systems that are 
able to manage the submissions and other tasks related to the 
conferences organization. There are mainly two options. On 
one hand, it is possible to download different software to 
create our own management system. 
On the other hand, web-based systems offer the 
possibility to order services for a conference. In some cases, 
these additional services (which can include different 
options) imply a higher price. In other cases, these services 
are free. Some features typically provided by these platforms 
are [4]:  
 
Submission of abstracts and papers by Authors. 
 
Submission of reviews by the Program Committee 
Members (PCM).  
 
Download of papers by Program Committee (PC). 
 
Handling of reviewers preferences and bidding. 
 
Web-based assignment of papers to PCMs for 
review. 
 
Review progress tracking. 
 
Web-based PC meeting. 
 
Notification of acceptance/rejection. 
 
Sending e-mails for notifications. 
A Web-based solution acts as a communication channel 
between submitters and organizers/editors.  
First of all, a user must register (create an account) in 
order to gain access to the system, which allows him/her to 
add/modify submissions and get feedback [2]. The 
registration process allows users to enter personal details and 
select his/her username and password. In many occasions 
additional information may be required [2]. 
In order to submit a paper to a conference, we should go 
to the platform that hosts the conference. On most platforms, 
it is mandatory to introduce the title, abstract, keywords and 
author names. 
These keywords are used to facilitate the allocation of 
submissions to suitable reviewers. The user can submit an 
abstract and can check the submitted data, as well as observe 
16

the status of his/her paper. If the abstract is accepted, the user 
will be able to upload the full text version for review [2]. In 
other cases, the full version of the paper is sent at the same 
time with the abstract. 
After the submission deadline, the papers must be 
assigned to several reviewers. Hence, the PC Chair sends the 
submitted papers with review forms to individual reviewers. 
The review form consists of a set of questions to assess the 
quality of the paper that the reviewers must fill in and return 
it to the PC Chair. Each platform has a specific system to 
organize the distribution of papers between the reviewers. 
Each submission is typically evaluated by at least 2 or 3 
reviewers.  
Generally, the review process ends with the PC meeting 
where the papers are discussed on the basis of collected 
review forms, in order to decide their acceptance or rejection 
for presentation at the conference [4]. 
In this paper, we are going to compare some of the most 
important review platforms, which allow us to host our 
conferences. Finally we have compared the features of the 5 
platforms that have organized more than 1000 conferences 
from their beginnings. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
shows works about some platforms for managing the 
conferences. Some researches about the improvements of 
these platforms are also included. Section 3 presents the 
platforms and review systems available in internet. We also 
show the number of conferences organized in their history. 
The evolution of some of these platforms is shown in Section 
4. Section 5 presents a comparative study of the five 
platforms, which have hosted more than 1000 conferences. 
Section 6 shows our conclusions and future works. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
There are some works that present new platforms for 
conference managing and others, which analyze some 
statistical data about the use of these platforms. In this 
section we are going to see some of them. 
According 
to 
the 
Association 
of 
Learned 
and 
Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) [1] on web 
submission and review systems for journals, among the 442 
respondents selected at random from the ISI Web of 
Knowledge database, we should highlight this: 
 
81% of users prefer to use web submission and 
review systems 
 
36% of users would think twice when choosing 
a journal without online submission for their 
work. 
When the online submission systems were introduced, 
there was an increase of 25% in submission volumes and 
publishers reported a decrease of 30% in the administration 
time. For these reasons the online submission and review 
systems are playing a significant role in the conferences 
organization process. 
B. Martens et al. [2] discuss the logistics of the 
submission and review process of conference entries by 
means of a “free”, web-based application. They focus their 
explanations in the SOPS (SciX Open Publishing Services), 
a conference application that has been developed. The SOPS 
application 
provides 
functionalities 
to 
support 
the 
organization of a conference offering services for the 
registration of participants, submission and reviewing of 
abstracts, full-paper submission, reviewing and publishing. 
M. Papagelis et al. [3] present an implemented system 
named Confious. It is a state-of-the-art management system 
that combines modern design based on a sophisticated 
algorithm that helps the program committee (PC) Chair 
perform some of the most difficult tasks in the conference 
organization. 
This 
system 
improves 
the 
efficient 
management and monitoring of the overall coordination 
process in conferences. 
J. H. Johnson et al. [5] describe a web-based application 
system that can offer support for conference organizers. It 
was developed in 1997. WitanWeb offers interactions among 
program committee members, authors, and reviewers for the 
refereeing process of conferences. Authors also describe the 
evolution and changes that Witan Web can admit to adapt its 
function to several research fields. 
As we have mentioned earlier, one of the problems in the 
organization of conferences is the distribution of submissions 
between reviewers. In this context, N. Di Mauro at al [4] 
describe the Global Review Assignment Processing Engine 
(GRAPE). This system allows the conference management 
and other tasks, such as automatic assignment of reviewers to 
papers submitted to a conference, additionally assessing the 
quality of the results of this activity in terms of profitability 
and efficiency. Their proposal was evaluated on real-world 
conference datasets obtaining good results when compared to 
the handmade ones. 
S. Dumais et al. [6] present a new automated assignment 
method called “n of 2n” that achieves better performance 
than human experts. This method sends twice as many 
papers as they are actually asked to review, so they can 
choose which ones they want to review (the rest are assigned 
again). This method may also have some motivational 
advantage over traditional assignment methods where the 
reviewers 
have 
no 
choice. 
This 
method 
achieved 
improvement of 48% compared to the random assignment. 
D. Yarowsky et al. [7] describe and evaluate a system for 
the automatic routing of submitted papers to reviewers and 
area committees. The main characteristic of this method is 
that the system does not need any human annotation from the 
reviewers or the program chair. The routing system is based 
on a profile of previous writings available on-line for the 
reviewer pool. Authors explore several variations of the core 
model, “which makes that system accuracy be close to the 
task of several human judges on the same task. 
P. Rigaux [8] presents a simple method, which provides 
an approximate solution to the problem without requiring 
each user to rate each item. The method is based on an 
iterative process. The iterative process is performed by a 
collaborative filtering algorithm. The system allows users to 
rate a sample of the paper. Then the algorithm predicts the 
missing ratings as well as their level of confidence (which is 
initially 0). A new ballot improves the accuracy of 
predictions. The administrator of the system is responsible 
for stopping the iteration when a satisfactory level is reached.

The method presented by P. Rigaux can be used for the 
assignment of reviewers to papers. 
As far as we know, there are no other works similar to 
ours, where the most important platforms for organizing 
conferences are analyzed and compared. 
III. 
DESCRIPTION OF EACH PLATFORM 
There are several platforms to host conferences. But 
people usually tend to use only some of them. In this section, 
we are going to explain the main aspects of each review 
system according to the information available on their 
websites. We have also provided a comparative in number of 
conferences hosted by each platform. 
Easy Chair [9] is a free conference management system 
easy to use. It presents several features to make it suitable 
and flexible for various models of conferences. It has been 
designed to help program chairs to cope with the complexity 
of the reviewing process. The first version of Easy Chair was 
implemented in 2002. It was used by 12 conferences from 
2002 to 2004. During 2005, 66 conferences used Easy Chair 
to host the conference. Since 2006, Easy chair has become 
number the one conference management system in terms of 
the number of conferences, users and submissions. 
Microsoft's Conference Management Toolkit (CMT) [10] 
is a free conference management service sponsored by 
Microsoft Research. CMT is capable of handling the 
complex workflow of an academic conference. In last two 
years, CMT has been used for more than 700 conferences, 
workshops and various other events. Last year, CMT had 
been used for more than 400 conferences including several 
ACM and IEEE conferences. 
EDAS [11] manages the paper submissions, review and 
registration process for conferences, workshops and journals. 
It is a hosted and supported service, i.e., no software is 
necessary. The support staff helps authors, reviewers and 
chairs without any problems. Users can interact with EDAS 
using standard web browsers. EDAS supports the full 
conference lifecycle. It includes submission and review 
processes, discussion and decision about papers, conference 
registration, copyright elaboration and travel grants. EDAS 
can offer support for Visa letters, CD-ROM, USB and IEEE 
Xplore proceedings and conference program brochure. In 
addition, this platform can host the conference web pages, 
with a configurable template and system menus. The host of 
a web site does not incur extra cost and the web pages are 
maintained indefinitely. 
ConfTool [12] is a Web-based event management system 
developed to support the organization of academic 
conferences, workshops, congresses and seminars. It is 
available in several languages. ConfTool offers two versions 
of services, in function of the event features. On one hand, it 
has a standard version designed for smaller events with up to 
150 participants. The service is an open/shared-source 
system, which can be acquired under different licenses. For 
organizing small non-commercial events, ConfTool offers a 
free license. On the other hand, it has a professional version 
more flexible than the previous one. It can be used for events 
with many participants, several contribution types and sub-
events. 
Open Conference Systems (OCS) [13] was created in 
1998. OCS is a free Web publishing tool that allows 
organizers to create a complete Web presence for 
conferences. OCS allows to create a conference Web site and 
compose and send a call for papers. Through OCS platform, 
it is possible to electronically accept paper and abstract 
submissions where authors can edit their work. At the end of 
a conference, organizers can post conference proceedings 
and papers in a searchable format, and even if the organizer 
wants, it is possible to integrate a post-conference online 
discussion forum. 
START V2 [14] is an integrated, user-friendly, web-
based system for managing peer-reviewed conferences. This 
interface was designed to follow the typical flow of a 
conference's editorial process. START V2 can be used in 
two ways. On one hand, the organizer can download and 
install the system to run on his server. The other option is to 
have the server hosted at softconf.com. In both options the 
license includes the maintenance services, upgrades and 
installation help, for the duration of your conference process. 
Conference Online-Management System (COMS) [15] is 
a web application for managing the registration, payment, 
paper submission and paper review. This system tries to 
accommodate the support to the conference features. The 
Conference Chair or administrator can perform changes in 
his COMS profile and see the effects of these changes in 
real-time. It is possible to achieve a simple user interface 
disabling some features for the users view. 
Congrex [16] is an international management company 
that offers support and services for meetings, events, 
conferences, 
association 
management, 
travel 
and 
accommodation. Congrex, offers conference bid support, 
venue sourcing including a destination comparisons, 
conference logistics management, such as, registration 
services, program content management and financial 
management and budgeting, among others.  This system can 
also 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
conference 
promotion 
and 
accommodation and conference housing bureau, etc. 
CyberChair [17] fully supports all activities comprised in 
the review process. CyberChair was founded in 1997. 
According to some statistics, the use of this platform has 
decreased in the number of conference since 2005. The last 
conference was organized in 2011. This platform allows 
authors to send the abstract of their papers and the final 
version in the camera-ready, follow the status of his paper 
and the notifications of acceptance and rejection. In addition, 
the PC chair can control the reviewer assignment based on 
the reviewers' preferences and expertise and the review 
submission process, prepare the proceedings (according to 
the Springer-Verlag procedure) and the abstracts for the 
conference website and program booklet. 
TrackChair [18] is a modern tool for peer review 
conferences. It has been developed by conference organizers. 
This platform divides the conference process in four stages: 
conference setup, paper submission, review assignment and 
tracking and accepting and rejecting papers. For managing 
our conference, we can use Firefox or Safari because both of 
these browsers are much faster than Internet Explorer, 
especially with large pages.

iChair [19] is another platform to control and manage the 
submission and review process in a conference. iChair was 
developed in the third quarter of 2005 by Thomas Baignères 
and Matthieu Finiasz. The developers tried to make this 
platform as easy to install as possible. This platform can be 
used on a Windows based server an in Linux box. It is based 
on a server software designed to help the program chair of a 
conference with all tasks involved in the conference 
organization. iChair can perform the tasks of submission 
collection, assignment of articles to reviewers, review 
collection, discussions, mailing to authors and reviewers, 
among others.  
Academics [20] provides customized software solutions 
and services for academic professionals around the world. 
Because the conference management can be a complex chain 
of tasks involving communication, collaboration, job 
assignment, and decision making between CP chair, authors, 
reviewers, Academics can facilitate this process. It offers 
several web-based systems for conferences. Some of them 
are paper submission and review system, conference 
management system, and event registration and payment 
system. Depending on the conference features, these services 
can be customized without charging over the original price. 
Confious [3] is a state-of-the-art management system that 
combines modern design based on a sophisticated algorithm 
that helps the program committee (PC) Chair perform some 
of the most difficult tasks in the conference organization. 
Confious system is provided as a web service. This means 
that there is no need for separate installations for each 
conference 
served. 
Confious 
can 
support 
multiple 
conferences in parallel, transparent between each other. This 
system improves the efficient management and monitoring 
of the overall coordination process in conferences. 
From the available data on their conference web sites, we 
have extracted the number of conference that each platform 
has hosted. Table 1 shows the number of conferences 
organized by each system until now.  
According to these values, we can see that the most 
important web-based system is EasyChair. It has become 
very popular between the research communities in last years. 
EasyChair has hosted more than 21.000 conferences.  
Other platforms like EDAS, ConfTool, Open Conference 
system and START V2 are also very important. All of them 
have organized more than 1000 conferences.  
We can group together the platforms that have organized 
between 100 (or nearly) and 1000 conferences. This group 
includes CMT, COMS, Congrex, CyberChair or TrackChair.   
Finally there exist some web-based systems where the 
number of conference is fewer than 50 (or nearly), like 
Confius, Academics, iChair and SIGCHI. All of them 
(except the last one) are apparently out of use from 
conference since 2009 or 2011. SIGCHI has conferences to 
organize during 2013 and 2014. 
IV. 
EVOLUTION OF CONFERENCES 
The platforms evolution we have presented, in terms of 
the number of conferences organized, can vary greatly 
depending on the year. The data that each system provides 
can be very limited. In this section, we are going to show 
values of conferences organized considering their relevance. 
We have tried to show their evolution in different years. 
Fig. 1 shows the number of conference in percentage for 
the 13 platforms that we have cited. 
We can see that Easy Chair is the most used system for 
organizing conferences, even more that the sum of all others.  
EDAS, OCS, START V2 and ConfTool are also widely 
used. They have percentages from 10% to 5%. CTM, 
CyberChair and COMS have percentages from 5% to 1%. 
The rest of these platforms are less important. 
It is possible to perform an interesting analysis by 
comparing the data of number of conference per year.  
Unfortunately, all sites do not provide this kind of 
information. For this reason, in Fig. 2 we have only shown 
the evolution of sites that offer information per years until 
2012. We have grouped in an only group the review 
platforms with lowest percentages (CONFIUS, Academics 
and iChair). Because the number of conferences to 2013 can 
change, we have processed this data separately. 
As Fig. 2 shows, START V2 began its trajectory as a 
conference organizer in 2002. The first years it registered a 
great increase in number of conferences having its maximum 
register in 2008 (233 Organized Conferences). In recent 
years, the number of conferences organized has decreased up 
to 200 conferences per year.

Figure 3.  Number of conferences per dite in 2008.  
This value remains constant until 2012. START V2 has 
(at the moment) 129 conferences for this year. 
Although ConfTool started to work 2 years latter (in 
2004), this platform, has registered a higher increase than 
START V2. Its maximum values have reached in 2011 with 
309 organized conferences. Since then, ConfTool has had 
285 conferences in 2012 and at the moment it is organizing 
141 conferences for 2013. 
CyberChair was founded in 1997. CyberChair had an 
increase of use in the following years to its creation. But it 
evolution has not been so high than others like ConfTool and 
START V2. CyberChair presents its highest values in 2003 
with 101 organized conferences. These values remained 
stable until 2004. The number of conferences started to 
decrease since 2011 when CyberChair organized its last 
conference. In last years of CyberChair (2009), COMS 
appeared. COMS has organized around 60 conference per 
year until 2012. 
In 2012, CONGREX started to organize conferences. As 
we can see in the first years the platforms, they experiment 
an increase in the number of organized conferences. 
Assuming that this site is still in the first period and that it 
has already some conferences to organize in 2014, 2015 and 
even 2016, it is possible that the use of this platform will 
increase in the next years. 
Fig. 3 shows the number of conferences organized by 
some of these systems during 2008. 
In 2008, the number of conferences of ConfTool and 
START V2 are very different. Both represent more than 90% 
of the total of conferences organized. iChair, CyberChair and 
CONFIUS have little representation in the organization of 
conferences. Its very important to obtain recent data to 
analyse the actual importance of each platform, because the 
changes can be high .In 2008, CONGREX had not been 
created. 
Fig. 4 shows the number of conferences that are being 
organized by the some of these systems in 2013. 
From 2008, we can see that these percentages have 
changed. According to the available data, EDAS will be the 
most relevant web-based service in 2013. Regarding to 
information of Fig. 2, ConfTool and START V2 have similar 
behaviour.  
In 2013, this behavior still exists and both of them have 
percentages near 20%.

Figure 4.  Number of conferences per site in 2013. 
ConfTool has more conferences (12 more than the 
number of conferences in 2008). COMS has almost half the 
percentage that START V2 has. 
The total number of conference included in the 
information available is 401 conferences in 2008 and 671 
conferences in 2013. 
V. 
COMPARATIVE STUDY 
In this section, we are going to compare the five most 
important platforms, in terms of the number of conferences 
organized from their beginnings. Table 2 shows the 
platforms features of systems with more than 1000 organized 
conferences. 
As we can see, all of 5 platforms have similar 
characteristics. EDAS allows authors to have access to 
submit works in any conference that EDAS are organizing. 
The other platforms do not offer this feature. EasyChair, 
ConfTool and OCS have a demo version that allows 
organizers to see a preview of the product that they are going 
to purchase. All of them are relatively easy to use and are 
very flexible (all of them have am available user guide, 
except EasyChiar). That means that organizers can 
customize their final product. In exception of EasyChair and 
EDAS, the rest of platforms have a friendly point of view to 
the authors. OCS, START V2 and ConfTool can be used in 
other languages than English. Only ConfTool permits to 
select the option to manual selection to send each submitted 
paper to each reviewer, the other makes it automatically. 
ConfTool and Start V2 show past conferences and allow 
searching conferences per year, but neither allows searching 
conferences per topics or countries.

All of them permit to select a multitrack or single track. 
Finally, except START V2, all of them can support reviewer 
discussion. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
When we want to organize a conference, it is very 
important to consider the use of a platform to submit and 
review articles. After all the information recopiled, we can 
see that there are several systems and platforms for 
organizing conferences, some of them free. Nowadays, the 
most important one is EasyChair, which are partly free. 
Almost all systems show similar behaviour. In their first 
years since their creation, they start to experiment an 
increase in the number of organized conferences. Some of 
them get maximums some years later and after that, the 
number of conferences remains stable for years. Others, after 
reaching the maximum value, start to decrease in number of 
organized conferences. That can be caused by the 
development of new systems with more options.  The new 
options usually present lower price and in many occasions 
offer easier systems to submit or review papers than the 
existent options. So the popularity of existent systems that 
actually are now the most popular can increase or decrease 
according to the competitiveness against new systems.  
Finally, if we want to choose a platform to host or 
manage our conference, we should keep in mind several 
features even the price of the service. For example, OCS and 
START V2 are completely free while EasyChair and 
ConfTool are partially free and EDAS is not free. 
We think that this work can be used by organizers as a 
guide to choose the most convenient platform for his 
conference, according to their characteristics, such as 
number of expected attendees, number of tracks of 
conference, etc. 
Now, we are analyzing the main destinations to locate a 
conference in function of several factors, such as climate and 
the use of new technologies of countries, among others. 
Moreover, we will study if regular virtual learning platforms 
[21] could be used for this purpose.
