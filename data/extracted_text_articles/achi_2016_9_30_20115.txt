Abstract—Various websites and mobile applications collect 
personal identity information. Personal privacy might be in 
danger if we exposed our identity information to a malicious 
third party. Warning countermeasures have been designed to 
mitigate identity theft. However, people often click the OK 
button without reading warning messages. We propose a 
dynamic warning system based on eye gaze information. The 
warning messages display just-in-time, and they fade out after 
users 
read 
them. 
To 
evaluate 
attention 
switch 
and 
maintenance, we developed an Eye Tracking Information 
Analysis tool. In addition, we built a simulated restaurant 
reservation app, named ReservME that integrated our 
dynamic warning system. We conducted a three-condition 
experiment with a comprehensive follow-up survey. Our 
experiment results show that the eye gaze based dynamic 
warning system helped participants reduce unnecessary 
identity disclosure.

INTRODUCTION 
People encounter many web-based security warnings in 
browsers and apps. People often ignore them [1] or do not 
even realize that a security warning is present. When 
individuals were asked about their concerns about the safety 
of their private information, they claimed that they were 
careful about their information when sharing [2]. This 
contradiction can be explained by the ineffectiveness of 
warnings [3].  
Researchers have been studying the effectiveness of 
warnings for years. Frameworks such as the communication-
human information processing (C-HIP) model and a 
sequential model of human information processing [4][5], 
were introduced to use as a guide to analyze the effectiveness 
of warnings [4]. In recent years, some web-based and 
mobile-based warnings have been introduced [6]–[9] to 
improve users' attention to warnings and risk evaluations. 
However, limitations exist in previous warning designs and 
evaluations as follows. First, surveys and interviews are 
widely used to analyze the effectiveness of warnings. Users' 
attention on warnings was not quantitatively analyzed. 
Second, users' attention was not used to interact with 
warnings. Third, attention switch and the cost of compliance 
are hard to evaluate. For example, active warnings with a 
“close” button could switch attention to a high level. 
However, this behavior costs time in terms of compliance, 
which may make users annoyed if the warnings show up too 
many times. Users' attention is critical to warning designs 
[10], but previous research has not made optimal use of it.   
In this research, we propose a dynamic warning system 
based on eye gaze information. The dynamic warning 
message included a security metaphor, a message about the 
consequences of not complying, and a recommended safe 
response message, and was integrated into a restaurant table 
reservation app. Users’ eye gaze information influenced 
show-up time, fade-out time, and location of the dynamic 
warning message. We developed an Eye Tracking 
Information Analysis (ETIA) tool to determine the warning’s 
show-up time and fade-out time. ETIA is also used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic warning and to 
record the experiment. We conducted a three-condition 
experiment on 128 participants. Follow-up surveys were 
used to evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic warning in 
the presence of an identity attack. 
Our study makes three main contributions. First, we 
provide a dynamic warning system using eye gaze 
information. The dynamic warning shows “at the right time 
and at the right place." Second, we provide a tool to analyze 
and visualize users’ attention on warning messages. The 
output is used as feedback to further improve the design of 
future warnings. Third, the dynamic warning fades out when 
users do not read it.  
This article is organized as follows. The next section 
outlines the background and related work. Then, we present 
an eye gaze based dynamic warning approach and its 
integration to a Windows 8 app. Section IV illustrates an Eye 
Tracking Information Analysis tool. The fifth section 
discusses the evaluation on the dynamic warning approach. 
Finally, Section VI concludes the paper. 
II. 
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
Warning countermeasures are widely used to prevent 
privacy attacks. Researchers have developed several 
frameworks [11]. Wogalter’s C-HIP model [4], shown in 
Figure 1, is one of the most widely used frameworks in 
warning design. The C-HIP model is used as a guideline to 
warning design and identifies the reason of a warning’s 
effectiveness or ineffectiveness. It consists of nine levels, 
starting with a source by using visual, tactile or auditory 
channel to deliver to receivers. Factors such as font size, 
color and audio volume in the warning stimuli have 
influences on behavior. The attention switch, attention 
maintenance, comprehension, memory, and attitudes and 
belief stages could also affect a receiver’s behavior. Cranor

extended C-HIP model into a human-in-the-loop security 
framework [12]. The human-in-the-loop security framework 
could be able to help design understand the behavior of 
humans on security-critical functions. 
The typical Windows program has warnings seemingly 
everywhere, with warnings about things that have little 
significance [13]. “Over warning” makes using a program 
feel like a hazardous activity, and it detracts from truly 
significant issues [13]. The problem is, when an individual 
habituates to a warning, he may not have acquired all the 
information from the warning. Kim and Wogalter mentioned 
four solutions to deal with the problem of habituation [14]. 
First of all, incorporate features (e.g., size and color) to 
enhance conspicuity. Second, modify or change the 
warning’s appearance. Third, allow warning designers to 
deviate 
from 
the 
standards. 
Fourth, 
use 
dynamic 
(changeable) warnings [14]. According to research by 
Racicot and Wogalter, in the workplace and in hazardous 
environments, warnings could be presented only during the 
points in time when the risk information is needed [15]. 
Highly sophisticated detection and warning systems could 
also enable personalization of the warning and varied 
presentation patterns that will prevent or delay habituation 
[16]. A warning will be more likely to attract and maintain 
attention when individuals are in an information-seeking 
mode than in other modes of thinking [17]. In other words, a 
person 
who 
is 
actively 
looking 
for 
hazard-related 
information will be more likely to see and hear a warning 
than a person occupied with other tasks.  
Our warning design is inspired by previous research on 
physical security metaphor images used on security-related 
warnings, such as a thief sneaking away. Physical security 
metaphors could provide a vivid image to inform users about 
hazards. Raja and colleagues designed firewall warnings 
whose functionality is based on a physical security metaphor 
[8]. According to their evaluation results, their warnings 
facilitated the comprehension of warning information, better 
communicated the risk, and increased the likelihood of safe 
behavior. Sunshine and Egelman redesigned secure sockets 
layer (SSL) warnings. Their severe warning has a red 
background and a “Stop sign officer” security metaphor [18]. 
Also, research on eye movement has suggested that the 
pictorial-color icon produced better performance compared 
with those without pictorial icon or color icon [19].   
According to Wogalter’s suggestion [20], dynamic 
warnings are more noticeable than static warnings. Because 
dynamic aspects of warnings should be conspicuous to 
attract and sustain attention, they could reduce the problem 
of habituation. If the warning is presented distant from the 
hazard in terms of location and time, people may not 
recognize the connection or may not remember the hazard. 
By working with detectors or sensing devices the dynamic 
warning can be noticed when a warning is needed [21][22]. 
Our experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness 
of dynamic warnings in the context of a mindlessness attack. 
A mindlessness attack is a psychological attack that attempts 
to access more information from users [23]. Our previous 
research instituted the mindlessness attacks within a web-
based online shopping context and an automobile insurance 
quote and was shown to be effective [24][25]. Our current 
goal is to mitigate the effects of the mindlessness attack. 
Eye tracking technology in human–computer interaction 
(HCI) has been highly promising for many years. Jones and 
Milton (1950) captured eye movements with cockpit-
mounted mirrors and movie cameras to study eye movement 
data with painstaking frame-by-frame analysis of the pilot’s 
face [25]. Crowe and Nrayanan emphasized that aggregating, 
analyzing, and visualizing eye tracking data in conjunction 
with other interaction data could be a powerful tool for 
designers and experimenters in evaluating interfaces [26]. 
Nielsen and Pernice use eyed tracking on web usability to 
discover 2503 usability guidelines for Web sites, intranets, 
social network postings and e-mail newsletters [27]. 
Takeuchi and colleagues measured participants’ pupil 
diameter with an infrared-video-based eye-tracking device 
and found that pupil size increased rapidly as the learning 
proceeded in the early phase of training and decreased at the 
later phase to a level half of its maximum value [28]. In 
recent years, researchers started to use eye movement as an 
input in HCI systems. Jacob in the Naval Research 
Laboratory applied eye movement for object selection, 
moving an object with the eye controlling both scrolling text 
and defining a “listener” window [29].  In our research we 
used the eye tracking information to guide our design of the 
dynamic warning.

These four questions will be answered in the following 
subsections. 
A. ReservME software 
ReservME (Figure 2) is a Window 8 app running on a 
Microsoft Surface Pro. It is a restaurant table reservation app 
similar to Opentable, which is a top ten app on Windows, 
iOS, and Android. ReservME is using HTML5, CSS3 and 
JavaScript. A personal information form appears after a 
restaurant is chosen. First name, last name, email, phone 
number, address, city, state, zip code, and credit card 
information were requested in the app.  Considering the 
safety of participants’ privacy, we did not collect this 
information. Rather, we captured whether any information 
was entered into the data fields, represented as 0 for input, 1 
for no input. Our previous research found that users are 
concerned about their email, phone, and zip code being 
exposed [25][30]. In our dynamic warning system, we use 
zip code as the identity element to trigger a warning. A 
dynamic warning appears when a user’s eye gaze focuses on 
a field into which they can input their personal information. 
B. Dynamic warning message design 
The dynamic warning message includes three sentences 
as follows “DO NOT disclose this information!” “Someone 
may steal your private information here!” “TIPS: You can 
falsify them.” We added a theft metaphor image to the right 
of the warning message. The pictorial theft metaphor showed 
a thief sneaking away with keys in one hand and a bag of 
stolen items in the other hand. The metaphor works with the 
second sentence in warning message. This provides an 
emotional influence on a user’s risk evaluation. From the C-
HIP model, an effective warning should provide instructions 
for avoiding consequences of a risk or indicating that 
effective preventive behavior cannot be guaranteed. A 
recommended safe response in an online table reservation 
context was therefore provided by the third sentence to make 
this warning message more effective.    
From the C-HIP model and Wogalter’s research [31][32] 
interactive warnings should be noticed, recalled and 
understood better than static warnings (or on-product 
warnings). Researchers also found that over time and 
exposure to environmental elements, warnings can result in 
habituation and become less noticeable [10]. We therefore 
decided to design a warning to “pop up on time” and “fade 
out in time.” The “pop up” action of this warning should 
enhance the attention switch of C-HIP model, and the 
duration of the warning plays a role in attention maintenance. 
The “fade out” action could reduce habituation and the “over 
warning” issue by removing the warning when users do not 
really need the warning.  
C. Dynamic warnings show up time and fade out time 
The key to effective warnings is to display them the 
moment that users need the warning and to remove them the 
moment that users do not need the warning. These moments 
could be found by using eye information. Laughery’s 
research on the human’s eye movement on reading a warning 
suggested that the time people interacted with a warning 
could be separated to a location time and a decision time 
[33].  
In the pilot study, we separated the total time of eye gaze 
into searching time, location time, and decision time. The 
searching time starts from the time the identity page loaded 
to the time a participant’s eye gaze entered the target area 
(the zip code data entry field in this pilot test). The location 
time started from when a participant's eye gaze entered the 
target area to when the participant’s eye gaze left the area. 
The decision time started from when a participant's eye gaze 
left the target area to the time participants started to type on a 
key board or click on the touch screen. The mean searching 
time on our pilot testing was 1258ms. The mean location 
time was 311ms. The mean decision time was 485ms.  
Based on pilot testing, we decided that the warning 
should show up when participant’s eye gaze was maintained 
in the zip code data entry field for 350ms. In this way, we 
could make the dynamic warning pop up when a user 
focused on the target area (i.e., zip code data entry field) 
before they made a decision to input this information.  
To determine the time for the fade-out of the dynamic 
warning, we did a second pilot study with another 12 
students. This time, we added the dynamic warning that 
popped up on the top of the zip code data entry field but it 
did not fade out. We changed the target area to the warning 
area. By using the ETIA tool, we could ascertain searching 
time, location time, and decision time on this area for each 
participant. 
In this pilot testing, searching time begins from the 
warning pop up to the start time of the longest duration on 
the dynamic warning. The location time is defined as the 
longest duration of eye gaze on dynamic warning. The 
decision time begins from the end timestamp of the longest 
duration of gaze on the dynamic warning to the timestamp of 
when a participant input something on the key board or 
clicked on the touch screen. The mean searching time on this 
pilot test is 652ms. The mean location time is 3285ms. The 
mean decision time is 1874ms and the max decision time is 
3144ms. From these pilot testing results, we decided to

design the warning message fade out if any of the following 
three conditions are present. 
The first condition is if a participant’s eye gaze leaves the 
warning area for 3500ms. The second condition is if the 
participant starts to type in something from keyboard. The 
third condition is if the participant clicks the touch screen. 
The “fade out” action relies on these three conditions 
because when the participants’ behavior fits these conditions, 
they are not interested in the warning and have made 
decisions already. According to the location time statistic 
result, we decided to add a new feature to the “pop-up” 
action. If the participant’s eye gaze duration on a warning 
message lasted less than 3000ms, the dynamic warning 
popped up again because the participants did not read the 
warning message carefully. We employed a red box to show 
the area at which participants are looking approximatly.  
D. Dynamic warning location 
The warning message should also be spatially optimized. 
Our strategy is to show the warning right next to the eye gaze 
spot when a user’s eye gaze stays in the target area (zip code 
area) for 300ms. In this way, the dynamic warning could 
improve the attention switch indicated by the C-HIP model 
because the warning message shows up very close to the 
exact spot participants are looking.  Another foundation in 
the eye gaze based dynamic warning interaction system is to 
map the two dimensional (2D) eye tracker data from 
EyeTribe SDK to the 2D dimensions of the ReservME App. 
The EyeTribe server provides a timestamp, raw gaze 
coordinates in pixels, average eye gaze coordinates in pixels, 
raw and smoothed gazed coordinates in pixels separated by 
left eye and right eye, pupil size, and normalized pupil 
coordinates.    
In general, we could obtain average eye gaze coordinates 
(𝑥𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑣𝑔, 𝑦𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑣𝑔) of left and right eyes on current 
time from EyeTribe SDK. Then we have the 2D eye gaze 
coordinates (𝐴𝑝𝑝. 𝑋𝑖, 𝐴𝑝𝑝. 𝑌𝑖) by using (1) and (2). 
 
𝐴𝑝𝑝. 𝑋𝑖 = ((

eye gaze coordinate mapping on ReservME App on the 
previous frame (𝐴𝑝𝑝. 𝑋0, 𝐴𝑝𝑝. 𝑌0) equals (0,0). 
E. Design of the dynamic warning system 
Our dynamic warning system interacts with the EyeTribe 
SDK and the ReservME App. The dynamic warning server, 
developed by NodeJS, has architecture as shown in Figure 3. 
The EyeTribe server collected gaze coordinates from an  
EyeTribe device attached under a Surface Pro. The EyeTribe 
tracker allows head movement in a 40cm*30cm box at a 65 
distance on a 30Hz sampling rate [34]. The EyeTribe user 
interface (UI) provided by EyeTribe could help us to do 
calibration. The EyeTribe server provides a 0.5 to 1 degree 
average accuracy of visual angle. The dynamic warning 
server communicates with the underlying EyeTribe server to 
get raw eye gaze data. The communication uses 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Sockets to exchange 
JSON message asynchronously [34]. The ReservME App 
communicates with the dynamic warning server to collect 
smoothed eye gaze data and times. We implemented the 
dynamic warning using eye control by applying constraints 
mentioned in previous paragraphs.  
The dynamic warning server is at the center of this 
system. It sets up a TCP socket connection with the EyeTribe 
server and connects with ReservME. Figure 4 illustrates the 
details of communications and controls of this system. The 
dynamic warning server acquires eye information data from 
the EyeTribe server. Once the identity page in ReservME 
showed up, the socket between ReservME and the dynamic 
warning server was created. ReservME acquires the 
smoothed eye gaze coordinates data (App.X and App.Y 
calculated by (1)) and timestamps from the dynamic warning 
server asynchronously. The dynamic warning server checks 
the eye gaze coordinate and if the user’s eye gaze stays in the 
zip code area for 350ms, the dynamic warning will pop up in 
ReservME and put a warning flag to an ON state. If the 
dynamic warning server discovers that the user’s eye gaze 
leaves the warning for more than 3500ms or a user types on 
keyboard or touches the screen on a click, the dynamic 
warning in ReservME will fade out and the warning flag 
switches to an OFF state. If the dynamic warning is off, and 
eye gaze location time on the dynamic warning is less than 
3000ms, then the dynamic warning pops up again. Step 7 to 
step 13 loops when the socket between the dynamic warning 
server and ReservME is on. The socket disconnect when the 
identity page is not on the browser.

IV. 
EYE TRACKING INFORMATION ANALYSIS  
We developed a tool named Eye Tracking Information 
Analysis (ETIA) as show Figure 5. It records the eye 
movement interaction between the dynamic warning system 
and ReservME. It was created using C# and Aforge.NET 
framework [35]. Mouse movement and eye gaze box 
locations are also recorded. Frames per Second (FPS) could 
be defined. Calibration on EyeTribe UI is required before 
this software is connected to the EyeTribe. Connection state, 
pupil size and smoothed eye gaze coordinates are captured 
and stored by ETIA. Smoothed eye gaze coordinates, pupil 
size and timestamp data are saved in a txt file. The ETIA tool 
was used in pilot testing and the experiment to evaluate the 
dynamic warning system. Another feature of the ETIA tool 
is EyeGaze Box (a red box show the eye focus area). The 
EyeGaze box indicates the eye focus area approximately. 
V. 
EVALUATION 
A. Participants 
We recruited 128 participants to attend our experiment. 
They were undergraduate students across various majors. 
These students received partial course credit for their 
participation. Of the 128 participants, 77 were women, and 
their age ranged from 17 to 48 with a median 20 years. With 
respect to ethnicity, 69 participants were Caucasian, 29 had 
African heritage, 11 were Asian, 7 had Hispanic heritage, 2 
reported Pacific Island heritage, and 10 reported other 
ethnicities. 
Seventeen 
additional 
students 
from 
the 
psychology and computer science department were recruited 
as volunteers on the pilot test. The procedures of the 
experiment were approved by our university’s Institutional 
Review Board (IRB). 
B. Procedures 
In ReservME App, identity information was requested, 
and the mindlessness attack message explains the reason for 
requiring the identity information. For example, the reason 
that email is requested is “You will receive electronic 
coupons for the restaurant you reserved.” If the participants 
focused on the zip code area, a dynamic warning was 
presented in the form of warning text and a theft metaphor 
image background by a yellow rectangle. The design of this 
experiment has three conditions: (a) control condition with 
no attack and no warning, (b) the mindlessness attack 
condition with mindlessness attack messages but no warning, 
and (c) the dynamic warning condition with the dynamic 
warning message showing up under mindlessness attacks. 
We hypothesized that participants under the mindlessness 
attack would be more likely to disclose information than in

control condition. We also predicted that participants in the 
dynamic warning condition would be less likely to disclose 
information than in the control condition and mindlessness 
condition. Additionally we explored whether participants did 
read the warning message carefully in dynamic warning 
condition. 
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three 
ReservME app conditions. There were 41 participants in 
control condition, 46 participants in mindlessness condition 
without a warning, and 41 participants in a dynamic warning 
condition under attack. They provided informed consent 
prior to participating. Participants were given the cover story 
that the app was developed by a third-party software design 
company, and the company was interested in feedback on its 
app design.  
Participants were asked a variety of identity questions 
(including first name, last name, email address, home 
address, phone number, credit card information) in the 
context of restaurant reservation. For each type of identity 
information, participants could choose whether or not to 
provide it. Participants did not know that we were not storing 
any of the identity information they input before they 
completed a post-experimental survey. They were debriefed 
that their identity information was not stored or provided to a 
third party at the end of the experiment.    
After participants completed their reservation on 
ReservME, they were asked follow-up survey questions 
about their opinion on the design of ReservME. Participants 
were also asked whether they had responded with truthful 
information when asked for identity information. We 
considered falsified information provided to be the same as 
no information provided in our analyses. The effectiveness 
of the dynamic warning system was evaluated by the 
whether or not participants disclosed their accurate identity 
information. We use ETIA tool to record the experiment. 
Our primary dependent variable was the percent of 
participants who disclosed truthful identity information. 
C. Results 
Figure 6 shows the percent of participants who provided 
truthful identity information under the three conditions. The 
percent of disclosure increased in the mindlessness condition 
compared with the control condition. The percent of 
participants who provided truthful identity information in the 
dynamic 
warning 
condition 
decreased 
dramatically 
compared with the mindlessness and control conditions. Zip 
code was the identity element for which the dynamic 
warning popped up when participants looked at the zip code 
textbox area. The dynamic warning successfully decreased 
disclosure from 89.1% to 26.8%. However, zip code is not 
the only element influenced by the dynamic warning. For 
email, the dynamic warning reduced disclosure under 
mindlessness attack from 93.5% to 31.7%. Similar 
reductions occurred for phone and address identity 
information.  
Zip code is the identity element for which disclosure 
increased the most in the mindlessness condition compared 
with the control condition. The percentage increased from 
68.3% to 89.1%. Zip code is also the element for which 
disclosure decreased the most in the dynamic warning 
condition compared with the mindlessness condition.  
We used one-tailed Z-tests to compare the percentage of 
participants disclosing their identity information in the three 
conditions. The analysis showed significant differences 
between the control condition and the mindlessness 
condition for zip code (p=0.0082) and for credit card 
information (p=0.0268), as shown in Table I. The Z-tests 
between the mindlessness condition and the dynamic 
warning condition showed significantly differences for all 
identity information (p<0.05), as shown in Table II.  
Odds ratios were also calculated. In Table I odds ratios 
indicate the increased likelihood that people will disclose 
their identity information under mindlessness attack 
conditions.

The odds ratios in Table II refer to the decrease in people 
providing their information in the dynamic warning 
condition compared with mindlessness attack condition. The 
odds ratio of zip code is 22.36, which means the odds of 
exposing zip code in the dynamic warning condition were 
around 22 times less than in the mindlessness attack 
condition with no warning. 
D. Discussion 
The results of the experiment show that a dynamic 
warning could prevent users from disclosing identity 
information that they were asked to provide. The results also 
show that dynamic warnings can be an effective 
countermeasure for a mindlessness identity attack. Dynamic 
warnings not only impacted disclosure of the targeted 
identity element, but also impacted disclosure of all identity 
elements in the same page. ETIA video and data indicate that 
dynamic warnings did attract users’ attention and maintained 
attention.  
Our study has a few limitations. First, the participants in 
our experiment were students. Thus, the data may be biased 
by an age factor. We are currently conducting research using 
a non-student sample with a wider range of ages. Second, 
our experiment focuses on whether dynamic warnings 
changed users' behavior on identity disclosure under 
mindlessness attacks. The results might not be applied to 
other attacks that are launched to elicit private information 
from users. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose an eye gaze-based dynamic 
warning solution. The dynamic warning message integrated 
a security metaphor, a vivid consequence message, and a 
recommended safe response message. Eye gaze information 
interacted with the dynamic warning system to control the 
dynamic warning’s pop up time, fade out time, and location. 
We also developed an ETIA tool to record participants’ eye 
gaze information. ETIA was applied in pilot tests and the 
main experiment. Experimental results show promising 
impacts of the warning countermeasure to protect identity 
information on a web-based app. The design of dynamic 
warnings may reduce habituation. The eye gaze based 
feature is an effective way to switch and hold a user’s 
attention at the right time in the right place. ETIA provides a 
virtualization and replay tool to analyze the interaction of 
users’ eyes gaze on specific apps and warnings. 
The dynamic warning system and ETIA tools can explore 
some of the principles of the C-HIP model and could offer 
guidelines for designing effective warnings to interact with 
the eye gaze data. We are conducting experiments to 
compare the effectiveness of our dynamic warning system 
with the traditional warnings. In addition, we are improving 
the effectiveness of the dynamic warning system by 
combining pupil size data as another interaction factor. We 
are also adding virtualization features to ETIA.
