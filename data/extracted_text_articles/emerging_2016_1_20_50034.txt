Abstract—A bidirectional transmission system based on Radio-
over-fiber
(ROF)
and
Passive
Optical
Network
(PON)
technology is proposed and demonstrated. In this paper, a local
oscillator with 15GHz via first Mach-Zehnder modulator
(MZM1)
and
1.25-Gb/s
data
via
second
Mach-Zehnder
modulator (MZM2) generate double sideband (DSB) signal.
The DSB signal is separated by fiber bragg grating (FBG) into
two optical downstream signals. One is the central carrier; the
other is the subcarrier, which transports from optical line
terminal (OLT) to base station (BS) by 25km single-mode fiber
(SMF) transmission. The power penalty of the system is < 0.1
dB(central carrier for downlink and uplink), downlink and
uplink transmission of BER values are lower than 10-9.
Keywords- Double Sideband; Fiber Bragg Grating; Mach-
Zehnder modulator; Passive Optical Network; Radio-over Fiber.

INTRODUCTION
Radio-over-fiber (ROF) system and Passive-optical-
network (PON) have developed rapidly during the past
decade. They can be applied to microwave communication
systems, such as wavelength division multiplexing (WDM),
optical add-drop multiplexing (OADM) and orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) [1]-[3]. The ROF
system
provides
broad
bandwidth
for
users
to
solve
transmission congestion. Optical fiber has lots of advantages
in long distance transmission, including high bandwidth, low
power loss, and immunity to electromagnetic interference
[4]. Rayleigh backscattering (RB) results in power fading,
deteriorating system performance and increasing bit error
rate because the fiber crystal structure is not uniform in the
manufacturing process, shifting the refraction.

To solve the RB of power fading, many schemes and
demonstrations have been proposed, such as using different
path
or
wavelength
between
uplink
and
downlink
transmission [5][6]. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional
ROF-PON system. The ROF-PON schematic system is
shown in Fig. 1, which has only one tunable laser used as an
optical source. Part of central carrier is remodulated for
upstream transmission, making the structure simple, low
cost, and highly flexibility to create different transport
structure.
II.
EXPERIMENT SETUP
Fig.
2
is
the
bidirectional
ROF-PON
system
configuration. OLT consists of tunable laser (TL), LO,
MZM, polarization controller (PC), FBG, optical circulator
(OC),
erbium
doped
fiber
amplifier
(EDFA),
and
microwave signal generator. TL is used as an optical source
with central wavelength of 1530nm. LO is generated at
15GHz by a microwave signal generator. The MZM1 is
driven by an optical source and LO to generate DSB signal.
1.25-Gb/s data and DSB signal are modulated by MZM2 to
generate the microwave signal with data.
We use different transmission paths in this system
because of the RB. DSB signal is separated by FBG to
central carrier and subcarrier as two downstream signals.
Each downstream signal is amplified by EDFA via a 25km
SMF transmission to base station (BS). BS includes PC,
phase modulator, EDFA, OC, variable optical attenuator
(VOA), photo-detector (PD), and
bit error rate tester
(BERT). We use a 10:90 optical coupler to separate the
central carrier into two signals. One is used for measuring
the BER, the other is reused as upstream light carrier. All of
the optical signals are measured by an optical spectrum
analyzer (OSA). VOA adjusts the optical signal power. PD
transforms the optical signal to an electrical one and
measures the BER value. The upstream light carrier uses
phase modulator to generate upstream data signal via a 25km
SMF transmission. The upstream light signal passes OC and
DI to transfer the phase modulated signal into the intensity
modulated one. The optical signal goes into receiver to
perform O/E convert for BER test.
III.
EXPERIMENT RESULT
The wavelength of TL is approximately 1530nm and the
optical spectrum is shown in Fig 3. Due to the sensitivity of
the MZM affected by polarization, we set a PC before MZM
to improve the stability of the MZM. The DSB signal is
generated first by MZM, which is presented in Fig. 4. DSB
signal with 1.25Gb/s data is generated by the second MZM
and the optical spectrum is shown in Fig. 5.

After the DSB signal is separated by FBG, the central
carrier and subcarrier are used as downstream signals for
different paths transmission. The central carrier wavelength
is reflected by FBG and the subcarrier passes through FBG.
The optical spectrum of central carrier and subcarrier is
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The downstream signal is
amplified by EDFA for avoiding transmission power loss
for 25km SMF transport.

respectively.
To
compare
with
intensity
modulation and phase modulation, we reuse part of the
downstream optical signal with phase modulation for the
upstream signal.

the phase modulator then amplified by EDFA, which is

Figs. 12-14 illustrate the eye diagrams of downlink and
uplink transmissions. Fig. 12 shows the eye diagram for the
central carrier downstream data while Fig. 13 shows it for
the subcarrier downstream data. Fig. 14 depicts the eye
diagram for the central carrier upstream data. From these
eye diagrams observation, we see that phase modulation is
better than intensity modulation. The system power penalty
of the central carrier for downlink and uplink is seen to be <
0.5 dB. The downlink and uplink transmission of BER
values are lower than 10-9.

Fig. 15. The measure BER curves.
The measured BER curves of received optical power
are presented in Fig. 15.The received optical power levels at
the BER of 10−9 are −22.5dBm (central carrier downlink), 
−22.4dBm (central carrier uplink), and −10.6dBm (subcarrier 
downlink). A power penalty of approximately <0.1 dB
(central carrier for downlink and uplink) for the fiber link is
observed during the BER test for 25 km SMF transmission.
IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed and demonstrated a bidirectional
ROF-PON system. The system has simple and low cost
features. Due to the RB effect, using FBG and OC achieve
different transmission path to improve power fading in the
OLT. We reuse part of the downstream signal as upstream
optical carrier in BS to achieve low cost. Compared to phase
modulation and intensity modulation for transmission, we
could
observe
the
eye
diagram
from
high
speed
oscilloscope. Phase modulation is better than intensity
modulation because PM has better anti-noise interference.
The power penalty of the system is < 0.1 dB, downlink and
uplink transmission of BER values are lower than 10-9. The
system can be combined with optical network and radio
frequency in the future, such as fiber to the home (FTTH),
Wi-Fi and antenna to implement long-haul transmission.
