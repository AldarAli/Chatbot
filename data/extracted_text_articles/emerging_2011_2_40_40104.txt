Abstract—In Wireless Sensor Networks, if the Multiple Access
Channel between distributed sensors and multiple antennas is
fading and the envelope of the channel gain distribution is
unknown and time-varying, fusion at the antennas is usually
incoherent. Often, the overall sensor power is upper bounded by
a constraint on the onboard battery power. Then, the optimal
sensor power allocation scheme which minimizes the probability
of missed detection is kno-wn to outperform uniform sensor
power allocation scheme. Further, if the observation signal-to-
noise ratios at the sensors are non-identical, optimizing the prob-
ability of detection must take into account the combined effect of
the differing sensor signal-to-noise ratios and the fading nature of
the channel as seen by the sensors. Neyman-Pearson formulation
of this problem sets out by setting an upper bound on the
permissible probability of false alarm. Consequently, the detector
threshold is governed by the power allocation scheme – uniform
or optimal. We examine here the inter-dependencies between
the probability of false alarm, the probability of detection and
the detector threshold. We demonstrate that for robust detection
vis-`a-vis variations in detector threshold, there is an additional
compelling case for optimal power allocation over uniform power
allocation.

I. INTRODUCTION
We address the problem of distributed detection over a
resource constrained Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The
schematic of the system taken from [1] is shown in Fig 1.
On-board batteries with limited power drive the sensors. The
sensed signal received by the sensors is corrupted by additive
noise, ampliﬁed by the sensor gain and transmitted over a
fading channel to the Fusion Centre (FC). To detect the sensed
parameter/event at the FC, we employ the Neyman-Pearson
(NP) formulation.
A. State of the Art
Uniform Power Allocation (UPA) to the sensors is shown
to be sub-optimal when the Multiple Access Channel (MAC)
is fading [1]. The authors there show that Optimal Power
Allocation (OPA) is superior to UPA under the following
conditions: (i) the channel is fading; (ii) the sensor observation
noise is i.i.d.; (iii) the sensor observation Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) is time-invariant; (iv) there is an overall sensor power
constraint; and (v) the False Alarm (FA) rate has a ﬁxed
acceptable upper bound. Thus, there is a saving in onboard
power even with i.i.d. sensor observation noise and time-
invariant sensor observation SNR. However, with non-identical
sensor observation SNRs, the OPA of [1] may lead to wastage
of system resources. OPA for the case of sensor noise with
different SNRs is addressed in [2].
B. Motivation for this Work
It was seen in Section I-A that UPA is sub-optimal when
the MAC is fading and that OPA is superior to UPA under
some conditions [1]. Suppose the sensor observation SNRs are
non-identical. Then, the OPA of [1] which does not take into
account the combined effect on the overall performance of (i)
the differing sensor SNRs; and (ii) the particular fading char-
acteristic of the channel path seen by the individual sensors,
has been shown to result in wastage of system resources [2].
Within a ﬁxed permissible probability of FA, PF A, the
NP scheme admits a choice of the detector threshold. Of
particular concern that we focus upon here is from a designer’s
perspective. It lies in examining the interval allowable to
choose the detector threshold, τ, within the constraints placed
by the tolerable PF A concurrent with the desired probability of
detection, PD, albeit for a given total sensor power constraint,
PT .

Moreover, as τ varies within the admissible interval of τ, it
is desired to study the nature of degradation of performance.
In relation to PF A, the detector threshold, τ, impacts PD. The
natural question that arises here is therefore the ’goodness’ of
the choice of τ for ’enhanced performance’. To answer this
question, we study the nature of inter-relationships between
PF A, τ and PD. The comparison here is across OPA and
UPA. Thus, equipped with a priori knowledge of the nature
of impact of τ on system performance, the user can choose τ
to balance conﬂicting criteria, dictated by the demands of the
speciﬁc application.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model with the power constraint. The
detection algorithm and its formulation comprise Section III.
Power allocation schemes are discussed in Section IV.
Simulation set up and results are presented and analyzed in
Section V. Concluding remarks form Section VI.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND MODEL
To facilitate readability, we brieﬂy describe the system setup
on the lines of the formulation in [2].
A. The Sensor
The sensor network comprises L sensors transmitting to
N antennas over NL channels as in Fig. 1 [3]. The sensed
parameter/event is Θ ∈ {0, θ}. Let H0 and H1 be the
hypotheses corresponding respectively to Θ = 0 and Θ = θ.
Further, in terms of the priors p0 and p1, let

H0 : 0
w.p. p0;
H1 : θ
w.p. p1.
At the ℓth sensor, the additive noise, ηℓ, is characterized as
ηℓ ∼ CN(0, σℓ2). Thus the sensor SNRs are not identical. The
gain of the ℓth sensor is αℓ ∈ C. Then, the sensor output is
αℓ(Θ + ηℓ); ℓ = 1, 2, · · · , L.
The constraint on the overall sensor power, PT , is given by

matrix of size L; and D(u) ∈ Cm×m is the diagonal matrix
with the entries of the vector u ∈ Cm×1 on the diagonal.
B. Multiple Access Channel (MAC)
The sensors feed into a multiple access fading channel. The
random gain from the ℓth sensor to the nth antenna is h(n, ℓ).

Schematic of the Setup
The channel gain matrix is thus H = [h(n, ℓ)] ∈ CN×L.
C. Antennas and the Fusion Center
There are N antennas at the receiving end. The additive
noise, vn ∼ CN(0, σv2), at the nth antenna, n = 1, 2, · · · , N,
is taken to be i.i.d. For simplicity, we assume the antenna noise
to be of unit variance. The output of the N antennas received
by the FC is y ∈ CN×1. Thus,
y = HαΘ + HD(α)η + v,
(3)
where η ∈ CL×1 and v ∈ CN×1. From the observed output,
bΘ ∈ {0, ˆθ}, at the FC, the problem is to detect the parameter,
Θ ∈ {0, θ}, emitted by the source and to analyze the system
performance.
III. DETECTION ALGORITHM
For detection, we assume y to be Gaussian. Thus,
H0
:
y ∼ CN(0N, R);
H1
:
y ∼ CN(θHα, R).

Here, 0N is the N × 1 zero vector and R is the N × N
covariance matrix of the received signal given by
R = HD(α)D(σ)D(α)HHH + IN.

Probability of false alarm vs. Mean detector threshold
detector threshold. This is empirical evidence in support of the
claim that in relation to the detector threshold, detection with
the OPA scheme is more robust than that in the UPA scheme.
The foregoing result has credibility only if the PDopt
compares favorably with PDuni. That it is indeed true is
borne out by Fig. 4. It shows that P Duni and P Dopt vs. their
respective τ. We observe four signiﬁcant features here.
1) The lowest value of P D for the UPA and OPA schemes
are respectively 0.0172 and 0.2581. That is, the OPA
scheme outperforms the UPA scheme in respect of
the empirical worst case detection. This is after taking
even the outliers into consideration, without which, the
disparity is further pronounced.
2) The highest value of P D for the UPA and OPA schemes
are respectively 0.7127 and 0.9816. That is, the OPA
scheme improves upon the UPA scheme in respect of
the empirical best case detection.
3) The mean of P D for the UPA scheme which is 0.5166 is
considerably lower than that for the OPA scheme which
is 0.9216.
4) Finally, on any interval of common support of the
detector threshold, the rate of fall of P D with the OPA
scheme is smaller than that with the UPA scheme.
Often, the price for a higher PD is a higher PF A. Hence, in
laying claims to a higher PD, one must bring into perspective
the associated PF A. Fig. 5 shows PF A vs. τ uni and τ opt. Here
too, we may note these characteristics.
1) For the same distribution of PF A, the range of τ over
which PD may be optimized is larger for OPA than it
is for UPA.
2) The probability of false alarm falls more rapidly with
the threshold in the case of UPA than in the case of
OPA. This must be expected in view of the fact that
for optimal detection, the OPA offers a larger interval
for the detector threshold in comparison to the UPA as
borne out by Fig. 4.
3) For the same value of τ, compared with the UPA
scheme, the OPA scheme yields not merely a higher
probability of detection (vide Fig. 4), but concurrently
operates at a lower probability of false alarm, except
for τ ∈ (2, 4.5). Moreover, even for this interval of τ,
it is noteworthty that PDopt − PDuni > 0.5.
In essence, the investigation here makes a strong prima facie
case for the OPA scheme over the UPA scheme in terms
of robustness of detection w.r.t. the detector threshold when
operating under an overall sensor power constraint. In fact, the
enhancement in performance is concurrently over conﬂicting
requirements.
VI. CONCLUSION
In Wireless Sensor Networks, we relaxed the AWGN con-
dition on the Multiple Access Channel and considered the
envelope of the channel gain distribution to be unknown
and time-varying. Moreover, the observation SNRs at the
multiple sensors were take to be non-identical. The detector
threshold in the Neyman-Pearson formulation holds a key to
the detection probability in relation to the probability of false
alarm. With an overall sensor power constraint, we used an
optimal detection scheme which takes into consideration the
combined effect of the sensor noise and the fading MAC on
detection. We examined the impact of the detector threshold on
the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm
under the uniform and the optimal PA schemes. Optimizing
the probability of detection independently in each of the power
allocation schemes was the common basis. For the case of a
single power constraint, we showed through simulations that
the optimal PA scheme outperforms the uniform PA scheme
concurrently on three counts: (a) Relative robustness of the
probability of detection vis-`a-vis the detector threshold; (b)
Comparatively high probability of detection; and notwithstand-
ing this, (c) relatively low probability of false alarm.
