Abstract—Telemedicine 
seeks 
to 
improve 
the 
quality, 
efficiency and cost of healthcare by a variety of electronic 
means. It is originally designed to serve patients in remote 
areas. The service involves the use of technologies to support 
the connection between doctors and their patients without the 
need for in- person meetings. Nowadays, the COVID-19 
outbreak could put a spotlight on Telemedicine as an 
important tool to avoid the community from infection. This 
study aims to examine public awareness and acceptability of 
telemedicine in Japan. Furthermore, it determines the main 
reasons which hinder the growth of the service in the COVID-
19 era from the public’s views. To achieve our goals, 84 
participants in the age ranging from 20 to 64 years were 
randomly selected, and data were collected from them using a 
questionnaire survey. The survey reveals that all participants 
are not telemedicine users. Fifty-nine (70%) participants are 
somewhat aware of telemedicine service, and 51% of them are 
very much interested in telemedicine. Only 3 (4%) participants 
are quite satisfied with the amount of information available on 
telemedicine. This is obvious as 50% of them have no detailed 
information about the service. Fifty-two (37%) participants 
state that online telemedicine education program is an effective 
way to raise awareness of telemedicine. The survey results also 
identify the major reasons for not using telemedicine service in 
the COVID-19 era. At present, there are various issues for a 
slow growth of telemedicine in Japan. Recommendations to 
increase awareness of telemedicine service have been made.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Telemedicine is defined as the use of Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs) to improve patient 
outcomes by providing accessible, cost-effective, and high-
quality healthcare services [1]. Telemedicine uses ICTs 
mainly to liberate patients and medical professionals from 
geographical barriers and time restrictions. The recent 
concept of telemedicine is extremely wide, ranging from 
diagnosis to therapeutics [2][3]. With the world-wide 
dissemination of telemedicine, as well as its clinical benefits 
and cost effectiveness, the Japanese Ministry of Health, 
Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has made efforts to promote 
telemedicine since 2015 [4]. In 2018, the service became 
available across the country but was limited to patients with 
certain chronic conditions who had already received 
prescriptions for medication [5]. Studies have been published 
showing the effectiveness of telemedicine in the treatment of 
various chronic diseases, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
and diabetes [4]. In April 2020, the COVID-19 crisis has 
prompted Japan to ease regulations on telemedicine [6][7]. 
However, the use of deregulated telemedicine has been 
sluggish compared to the US and UK [8]. Therefore, the 
present study aimed to examine public awareness and 
acceptability of telemedicine. Furthermore, it determined the 
major reasons which hinder the growth of telemedicine from 
Japanese people’s views. The rest of this paper is organized 
as follows. Section II explains the method of this study. 
Section III shows the major results of the survey. Section IV 
includes discussion and limitation of a study. Section V 
includes both conclusion and future work.  
 
II. 
METHOD 
To carry out this study, semi-structured questionnaire (12 
multiple-choice 
questions) 
was 
undertaken 
with 
84 
participants (63 Female and 21 male) between February and 
April 2021. Selecting the survey participants was based on 
their busy works with limited vacations time (about 10 days 
in a year) to visit hospitals. Participants were provided with 
an explanation of telemedicine and all information regarding 
the study, including the reasons for undertaking the survey. 
The questionnaire sheets had been given to the person of 
charge by hand in order to distributed among the employees. 
The questionnaire guide was informed by a literature survey 
in this study area [9][10] and piloted on 5 individuals. 
Following this process, questions were revised and 
determined. Probing questions were used to explore public 
awareness, and acceptability of telemedicine. Furthermore, 
the questions were used to find out the main reasons that 
hinder the use and growth of telemedicine in the COVID-19 
era. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the 
Kyushu University Hospital, Permission No 2021-15.

in different business sectors at 2 public universities in the 
Fukuoka city. The survey results indicated that all 
participants have no physical disabilities, and they had never 
experienced telemedicine. The majority (29%) visit the 
hospitals about 2 times a year (Table I). 
 
B. Awareness of Telemedicine 
About the levels of participants’ awareness of the service, 
59 (70%) participants were somewhat aware of telemedicine 
(Table II). Participants’ awareness of telemedicine developed 
through various means. The majority (53%) of participants 
indicated that media is the main source to know about 
telemedicine. Only 3 (4%) participants were quite satisfied 
with the amount of information available on telemedicine.  
This is obvious as 43 (50%) participants had no detailed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information about the service. Furthermore, 68 (56%) 
participants requested to clearly know about the regulations, 
cost, benefits, and risks of telemedicine service.  
      Concerning the acceptability of telemedicine, about 42 
(51%) respondents were quite interested in telemedicine 
concept, technologies and communication mode (Table III). 
Seventy-two out of eighty-four participants believed that 
telemedicine has various benefits. In Figure 1, the majority 
(30%) of participants indicated that it is an effective tool to 
avoid a risk of hospital-acquired infections.     
     Regarding the possibilities to raise public awareness of 
telemedicine, 52 (37%) participants called for setting up 
online 
education 
programs 
to 
teach 
people 
about 
telemedicine service (Table II).

C. Major Reasons for Not Using Telemedicine in the 
COVID Era  
     This study detected that there are different reasons (see 
Figure 2) led participants to not use telemedicine services. 
The majority (22%) of participants indicated they do not use 
telemedicine because it is not widely provided in the 
hospitals. The study findings show that 20% of participants 
do not know much about telemedicine services. About 12% 
of participants preferred to use in-person visit over a 
telemedicine, while some (12%) participants have concerns 
about their data privacy in telemedicine. About 10% of 
participants do not trust virtual diagnosis, whereas other 
(10%) participants indicated their ICT skills shortage. 
Furthermore, 4% of survey participants responded that it is 
difficult to build trust with doctors through telemedicine, 
while 3% of them mentioned about high cost of telemedicine 
technology. 
      On the other hand, 3% of participants chose ‘Other’.  
A few (2%) participants mentioned about ease of access to 
healthcare facilities, while other (2%) participants indicated 
that telemedicine is not a suitable tool to discuss serious 
topics with doctors. Only one participant pointed out that she 
did not use the service because of receiving negative 
comments on the service from others. 
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
 
The survey results revealed that the majority of 
participants are interested in telemedicine. They indicated 
that telemedicine might be an effective tool to reduce the risk 
of infection. However, they are not using it at present due to 
some important reasons. One of these reasons is about 
providing telemedicine services in a few hospitals. In Japan,  
there is a slow spread of telemedicine in the hospitals partly 
due to reimbursement challenges, lack of economic  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
advantage, and a lack of clinical evidence [4][11][12]. 
According to the MHLW, only 65 telemedicine-based 
episodes of medical care are performed per month in Japan 
[4]. Furthermore, a recent study reported that among the 
110,898 medical institutions that exist, the number of 
medical institutions implementing telemedicine increased 
slightly from 10,812 (9.7%) in April 2020 to 16,202 (14.6%) 
in June. Of this number, only 6,801 (6.1%) medical 
institutions implement telemedicine for a patient’s first visit 
[13]. Second major reason is related to limited information 
available about telemedicine service. Regarding this issue, 
the survey results detected that a few (4%) participants were 
quite satisfied with the amount of information avaliable on 
the service. This is obvious, as the majority (50%) did not 
have detailed information about telemedicine regulations and 
risks. Similar findings showed in our pervious study that the 
majority of Japanese physicians (39%) had no detailed 
knowledge about telemedicine, and only 3% of them quite 
satisfied with available information. Furthermore, the 
majority (32%) of them wanted to know about telemedicine 
guidelines and standards [12]. 
     Third reason is concerning communication preferences. 
Although a recent study demonstrated that patients can 
achieve the same level of communication effectiveness with 
their physicians using IT communication as they would in 
comparable Face-to-Face communications [14], about 12% 
of our participants preferred in-person meetings over 
telemedicine for promoting conversation through body 
language, while 4% of them indicated the importance of F-
to-F communication for establishing trust in relationship 
with doctors. Furthermore, a few (2%) participants believed 
that telemedicine is not an adequate tool for discussing deep 
and serious topics. Fourth reason is about lack of confidence 
in the service among the participants. The study revealed that 
12% of participants had concerns about protection of their 
medical information collected by telemedicine. Furthermore,

10% of them did not trust the accuracy of diagnosis by 
telemedicine. Similar finding showed in other articles that 
healthcare 
professionals 
distrust 
a 
diagnosis 
made 
via telemedicine [12][15]. Regarding this issue, if patients 
don’t trust the diagnoses made during telemedicine calls, 
they may ignore the advice given, fail to take preventative 
steps, or seek additional in-person appointments, which 
defeats the point of telemedicine [16]. For many e-services, 
end-user trust is a crucial prerequisite for use [17]. The fifth 
reason is related to the ICT skills shortage. About 10% of the 
participants did not have a sufficient technical skills to use 
telemedicine services. Regarding the acceptability of 
telemedicine technology, the present study found that the 
majority (62%) of older participants with ages ranging from 
45 to 63 years were not somewhat interested in the 
telemedicine technology (see Figure 3). Similar finding 
showed in other study that the elderly had a difficult time 
adjusting to the new technology of telemedicine [18]. 
Regarding the last reason, a few (2%) participants indicated 
that they did not use the service due to the ease of access to 
healthcare facilities and getting high-quality care at a low 
fee. Actually, Japan's health system is well known for 
achieving one of the world's highest life expectancy with 
universal health coverage. The important feature of the 
healthcare system in Japan is “free access.” Patients are 
completely free to choose any healthcare facilities, regardless 
of the severity of their disease and their insurance status [19]. 
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, a recent survey by the 
Association of Japan Medical Colleges revealed that the 
number of patients fell during April and May 2020 because 
many people opted not to visit the hospital due to fears they 
might become infected. The number of outpatients in April 
2020 dropped by 21 percent over April 2019, while the 
decrease in May 2020 was 27 percent [20].  
     Based on the above-mentioned findings, it can be said 
that a slow growth of telemedicine in the COVID-19 era is 
due to many issues. Comparing to the results of other studies 
[11][15], the present study revealed that the major reasons 
are not only link to the lack of infrastructure 
or 
reimbursement challenges but also due to other various 
reasons, and the most important of which is related to a lack 
of detailed information provided for all (including ordinary 
people and clinicians) about the service.  
      For people to ask for telemedicine service, they need to 
understand well its possibilities and limitations. According to 
the participants' opinions, the most effective way to promote 
the level of awareness of telemedicine is through education 
programs. Although international remote training programs 
for medical engineers have been implemented, there are no 
evidence reports on conducting online education programs 
for the public in Japan [21]. Therefore, this study 
recommends establishing telemedicine education program to 
teach people about telemedicine as an option for ‘a quick 
way’ to receive care. One of the necessary roles of the 
program is providing individuals with appropriate and 
complete information on when, and how to use telemedicine, 
as well as legal and ethical aspects associated with the 
service delivery. This would probably change their opinions 
about the service. 
      Regarding the limitation of this study, the survey was 
done with limited number of Japanese participants, and the 
results cannot be generalized beyond the participants of a 
study. The participants expressed their own perspectives for 
raising public awareness of telemedicine. These may not 
express views of the majority of Japanese people.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
 
       The present study examined public awareness and 
acceptability of telemedicine service in Japan. Furthermore, 
it determined the main reasons which hinder the growth of 
telemedicine in the COVID-19 era. Based on the survey 
results, it can be said that limited awareness of telemedicine 
plays an important role in a slow growth of the service. 
Greater public awareness about the service’s regulations, 
benefits, and risks is an essential step for improving 
telemedicine market in Japan. Therefore, this study 
recommended setting up education programs to provide 
people with detailed information about telemedicine service. 
Further researches are recommended to discuss the 
development of telemedicine education and training 
programs for all, including ordinary people and clinicians.  
      In the future, the authors would seek to run a large-scale 
survey in order to pick up major and minor barriers to 
telemedicine development in Japan, considering details 
about the chronic diseases of the population sample.
