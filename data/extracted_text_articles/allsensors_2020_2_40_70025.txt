Abstract—In this work, we report on a new evaluation of metal
oxide based on carbon dioxide sensors, using barium titanate
nano-powder. The sensing principle is based on a change in
conductance of semiconducting oxides when carbon dioxide is
present. The sensitive layer was deposited on a SiO2/Si
substrate by screen printing technology. The sensor responses
were studied between 100 and 5000 ppm of carbon dioxide in
the air with 50% relative humidity. The sensor presents good
sensitivity toward carbon dioxide, with a stable baseline, and
fast response and recovery time. These results are promising
for carbon dioxide sensing.

INTRODUCTION
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main gases
responsible for the greenhouse effect and, consequently, the
global warming trends. Hence, its monitoring is subject of a
major societal challenge. With an outdoors concentration up
to 500 ppm in urban areas, the ventilation balance is
affected and the development of reliable low-cost CO2
sensors at multiple sites becomes an industrial strategy.
Nowadays, the most commonly used method to detect CO2
is based on optical sensors. Despite their efficiency in CO2
detection, these technologies are expensive, have high
electric consumption and are not fully miniaturized. Metal
oxide gas sensors show potential features such as low-cost,
mass
production,
miniaturization,
fast
response
and
recovery times.
In 1991, Ishihara et al. [1] first proposed a composite
material based on p and n-type semiconductors, by mixing
copper oxide (CuO) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) powders.
In 2001, Liao et al. [2] showed that pure CuO and pure
BaTiO3 gave no response to CO2. Since then, these pure
materials have been definitively abandoned and only
composites have been studied. But, the sensors of Liao et al.
[2] were in the very basic form of large discs of sintered
powders with unknown granularity, connected by Ag paste
electrodes. Thus, we propose herein a new evaluation of
BaTiO3 based CO2 sensors.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we describe our approach based on BaTiO3 nano-powder
deposition on platinum interdigitated electrodes by screen
printing, a low cost, and an easily used technique. Then, in
Section III, the sensing results are discussed based on a
change in conductance of BaTiO3 when CO2 are introduced.
Finally, a conclusion is given in Section IV.

DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES
This description is composed of two parts; one is the
sensing film fabrication; the other is the measurement
system set-up.
A.
Gas sensors
Our gas sensor is made of Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes
(5 and 100 nm, respectively) deposited on Si/SiO2 by
magnetron sputtering. BaTiO3 thick films were deposited by
screen printing on these electrodes to produce a CO2
sensitive layer. BaTiO3 nano-powder (<100 nm, 4 g) was
mixed with glycerol (1.5 g) and screen printed on Si/SiO2
substrate with interdigitated platinum electrodes spaced by
50 μm (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Sample image of SiO2/Si substrate (4 x 4 mm2) with platinum
electrodes (bottom) and the final sensor with the BaTiO3 thick film (top).
The deposited film was annealed at 400°C on a hotplate,
in ambient air. The film structure was determined by X-Ray
Diffraction (XRD) with a Philip’s X’Pert MPD equipment
( = 1.54 Å).
B.
Setup
0.1 V DC voltage was applied to the sample while the
electrical
resistance
was
monitored
by
a
homemade
LabVIEW program using a Keithley Model 2450 Source
Measure Unit (SMU) Instrument (Keithley, U.S.A.). Dry air
(no humidity) was used as both the reference and the carrier
gas. A gas dilution and humidification system generates an
output mixture at the target CO2 concentrations (1 to 5000
ppm) with a variable humidity (0% to 90%). The sensing
properties of BaTiO3 sensors were tested by measuring the
sensor resistance for 5 min under CO2 diluted in dry air and
in humid air with a standard Relative Humidity (RH) value
of 50 %. The sensors were operated at several temperatures
from 200°C to 300°C on a hotplate. A constant total flow
was maintained at 500 Standard Cubic Centimeters per
Minute (SCCM) via mass flow controllers.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The XRD diffractogram of BaTiO3 thick film (Figure 2)
shows the presence of BaTiO3 nanocrystals in the tetragonal
phase of BaTiO3 [3].
Figure 2. BaTiO3 diffractogram using  = 1.54Å (Philip’s X’Pert MRD).
The BaTiO3 sensors for different CO2 concentrations
provide a measurable response depending on the CO2
concentrations in the 100 - 5 000 ppm range and 50% RH at
various
temperatures.
The
higher
response
amplitude
variations were obtained at 280°C. Figures 3 and 4 show,
respectively, the response and the sensitivity of the BaTiO3
sensor under CO2 in the air with 50% RH at 280 °C, the
optimum working temperature. It gives reversible responses
to CO2 concentrations between 100 ppm and 5000 ppm.
Figure 3. Resistive responses of BaTiO3 to six CO2concentrations
with 50% RH at 280°C.
The sensor response is defined in (1) as the ratio between
the sensor resistance under CO2 exposure and the sensor
resistance in the air:
R = Rgas / Rair
(1)
where Rair is the sensor resistance through humid airflow and
Rgas the sensor resistance in the presence of CO2.
The response time was less than 2 minutes and the
recovery time was about 5 minutes. The responses are
proportional to the CO2 concentrations, and they restored
the original baseline in less than 5 minutes.

with 50% RH at 280°C.
These results are in agreement with the recent review on
chemiresistive CO2 gas sensors [4].

CONCLUSIONS
This work reported preliminary results on a screen
printing BaTiO3 sensor working at an optimum temperature
of 280°C and for 50% RH. Our experiments showed stable
baseline
responses
with
fast
response/recovery
times
towards CO2. These sensors seem promising for measuring
indoor and outdoor air quality and for CO2 detection.
However, after a few weeks, using the same operational
conditions, the sensor responses were weakened on the
record. New experiments and analyses are in progress to
understand this phenomenon.
