Abstract— In this paper, the problem of detecting transient 
signals of unknown waveforms and arrival times embedded in 
white Gaussian noise is addressed.  The use of the cepstrum 
coefficients of the 4th order correlations of the transient signal 
for forming a detection statistic is demonstrated. It is 
considered  an adaptive approach for the detection of the signal 
which is assumed to satisfy a linear constant coefficient 
difference equation.  The adaptive approach is a least squares 
realization based on Q-R decomposition of the 4th order 
statistics matrix involved in the computation of the cepstrum 
coefficients. It is shown that the adaptive approach allows for 
detection of short length transients which are of unknown 
arrival times using a single data record even before the whole 
amount of data becomes available.

INTRODUCTION 
Detection of transient signals of unknown waveforms and 
unknown arrival times is a common problem in several 
signal processing areas. Some applications include detecting 
targets by radar and sonar. Another application is in 
hydraulic and power systems where monitoring sudden 
changes protects the system. In the detection of seismic 
waves and in biomedicine, the signal carries important 
information of the disease and an early detection is 
essential for the treatment. Transients can be either 
deterministic or stochastic signals, are short in duration, and 
are embedded in long periods of background noise.  In both 
cases we have a highly non-stationary problem.  Classical 
signal detection theory has been applied to this problem 
mainly using the autocorrelation or data domain. 
 If the deterministic signal waveform is unknown, but the 
arrival time is known, and the signal is embedded in additive 
white Gaussian noise, a generalized likelihood ratio test is 
discussed in [1], where the signal is the impulse response of a 
proper rational transfer function. However, some a-priori 
knowledge for the signal is required.  Furthermore, the 
detector is not of Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR). A 
similar approach is presented in [2] where the noise is 
colored Gaussian Autoregressive of order M (AR(M)) 
process.  For the same transient problem, but for unknown 
arrival times, the Gabor representation of the signals is used 
in [3]. 
Higher order statistics have been used for spectrum 
estimation of stochastic signals [4]-[11]. For detection 
problems, their use has not been very extensive.   
Here we propose a new detection scheme for the 
detection of transient signals based on the computed 
cepstrum coefficients of the fourth-order statistics of the 
signal [12]. Cepstrum coefficients are appropriate for 
representation of transient signals because they contain all 
the information of the signal.  Since they also peak around 
the origin, they are suitable for signal detection. The 
proposed method does not require knowledge of the noise 
variance or skewness and it is also able to detect the signal in 
the presence of non-Gaussian white noise as long as it is of 
zero mean independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) 
Higher order (3rd, 4th, etc.) cumulants are zero for 
Gaussian i.i.d. process [12]. This means that cumulants have 
the ability to suppress the noise. This fact is one of the 
reasons that we present herewith a detection statistic based 
on cepstrum coefficients and particularly the ones based on 
the tricepstrum sequence. However, the same detection 
statistic still works when noise is not Gaussian i.i.d. but non-
skewed (e.g. symmetrically distributed). 
The paper is organized as follows.  In Section II, the 
adaptive approach is presented for the proposed detector.  In 
Section III, its performance is demonstrated by means of 
simulation examples.  Finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section IV.

       𝐻଴: 𝑥(𝑛) = 𝑤(𝑛) 
𝐻ଵ: 𝑥(𝑛) = 𝑚(𝑛) + 𝑤(𝑛) 𝑛 = 0, … , 𝑁 − 1                    (1)

noise of unknown variance 𝜎௪

transient signal of unknown waveform.  The complex 
cepstrum of the 4th order statistics of a random process 
{𝑥(𝑛)} is known to satisfy the following identity [12],

1) 
Under 𝐻଴ it is assumed that {𝐴(𝑘)}, {𝐵(𝑘)} for all k are

2) 
Under 𝐻ଵ since the process {𝑥(𝑛)} is not stationary, it 
is assumed availability of many data records, 
i.e, 𝑥(௜)(𝑛) = 𝑚(𝑛) + 𝑤(௜)(𝑛), 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑀 is the given 
ensemble data set, where ൛𝑤(௜)(𝑛)ൟ are different noise

3) 
Since {𝐴(𝑘)}, {𝐵(𝑘)} are decaying sequences they can 
be truncated (2) and p, q finite integers can be used 
[12].

"T" denotes the transpose operation. Under H଴, the matrix 
F(p, n)  is of full, 2p rank. Asymptotically under 𝐻଴  the 
estimates of the tricepstrum coefficients, {A(k)}, {B(k)}, are 
Gaussian random variables of zero mean and constant 
covariance matrix. It is also assumed that if N →

ᇱ(m, k, n) become their true values f୶(m, k), 
f୶
ᇱ(m, k). Therefore, the following variable can be used as a

where, σୟౡ
ଶ , σୠౡ
ଶ  are the variances of A(k, n), B(k, n).  This is 
a central quadratic form (𝑙 ≤ 𝑝). For fixed probability of 
false alarm P୊୅, the threshold can be computed using the 
cumulative distribution F଴ of L୘ under H଴, 
 
                  t୦ = F଴
ିଵ(1 − P୊୅) 
                  (8) 
 
Instead of using 4th order statistics, 3rd order statistics 
can be used.  However, in this case the noise cannot be 
Gaussian, i.i.d.  The Additive White Non-Gaussian Noise 
(AWNGN) with zero mean assumption is enough to 
guarantee asymptotically under H଴ rank 2p, for the matrix 
 F(p). 
Summarizing the algorithm for detecting deterministic 
transient signals embedded in additive white Gaussian noise, 
we have the following: 
1) 
Estimate the 4th order statistics of f୶(k, l, n) [12]. 
2) 
Estimate A(k), B(k) using a least squares solution to 
the overdetermined system of equations (2) when 
p = q, m = p, … , p − W. W≥2p 
3) 
Compute 𝐿்  and compare it with a threshold chosen 
according to (8). 
 
B. The Recursive Approach of the Higher Order Cepstrum 
Based Detector 
Instead of estimating the cepstrum coefficients {A(k)} 
and {B(k)}  in one step when the whole data record is 
available we seek for a recursive solution of (6) which will 
allow for fast updating of the coefficients when new data 
arrive and the amount of the data is large.  Another reason 
for developing a recursive approach is when the arrival 
times of the transients are unknown.  It is assumed the 
following partition for f୶(m, k, n),  f୶
ᇱ(m, k, n).

a time recursion for C(p, n) is 
 
𝐂(𝑝, 𝑛) = 𝜆 ∙ 𝐂(𝑝, 𝑛 − 1) + 𝐚்(𝑛),                                     (10)

To realize this solution matrix F(p, n) is decomposed into 
two sub matrices, V and U and their Q-R decomposition is 
updated at each time instant that new information is present,  
𝐅(𝑝, 𝑛) = 𝐕்(𝑝, 𝑛) ∙ 𝐔(𝑝, 𝑛)                                                 (12)

Given the above initial values, new data at each iteration i, 
for both V୘ and U, namely u୧୬ଵ(i) and u୧୬ଶ(i) are obtained. 
The general notation u୧୬(i)  is used here. Then, Q-R

In the subsequent steps of the initialization period, we input

It 
remains 
to 
describe 
the 
orthogonal

In particular for each step, the partially triangularized matrix

where Dଵ/ଶ(i) is diagonal matrix and F෠(i) is a unit upper 
triangular matrix.  The requirement is to find rotation 
parameters so that we can annihilate the new input vector

After the end of the initialization period, initial Q-R 
decompositions for V୘(p, n) and U(p, n) are available.  It is 
denoted again in general each one of them by  A෡(p, n).  For 
U(p, n) the new data sets for the next iteration are its last two

twice.  For   V୘(p, n), per iteration its Q-R decomposition is

samples.  The signal plus noise records for AWGN of 
variance, σ୵
ଶ = 3.162x10ିଵ, 0.1, for 15 sample signal are 
shown in Figure 1a, 1b.  In Figure 2a, 2b, we plot the 
detection statistics for the tricepstrum method and for the 
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) adaptive algorithm versus 
time (the same way as for the definition of L୘, we use the 
sum of the squares of the estimated coefficients of the 
recursive IIR model as a detection statistic for the 
comparison algorithm).  For the tricepstrum p = q = 2 and 
l = 2 and for the IIR model order, 2 were the choices for this 
experiment.  For all the experiments below, including this 
one we keep l equal to the order of the model.  Both methods 
under H଴(0, … ,199) samples remain in the zero state and 
when the transient appears they jump and slowly converge 
again to the zero state.  The weighting constant λ was for 
both methods 0.99.  In Figure 2c, we show operation of the 
algorithms for noise variance σ୵
ଶ = 1 and λ = 0.98.

For example 2, we use 15 sample signal and arrival time at 
150 samples.  The tricepstrum and IIR detection statistics 
versus time are shown in Figures 3a, 3b.  The noise variance 
is σ୵
ଶ = 0.1, 3.162x10ିଶ  and we choose p = 2  for the 
tricepstrum and order 6 for the IIR, λ = 0.99 for both.  It is 
clear that because of the inability of the IIR model to catch 
the non-minimum phase character of the signal its 
performance becomes much worse.  This becomes more 
apparent if we compare Figures 3a and 3b, where the SNR 
values are 13.8 db and 12 db correspondingly.

In example 3, we make the non-minimum phase character of 
the signal even stronger and we plot also the detection 
statistics for both methods in Figures 4a-4c, for 25 sample 
signal 
and

variances,

ଶ =
3.162x10ିଵ, 0.1, 3.162x10ିଶ, 10ିଶ . The orders of the 
tricepstrum and IIR methods were 2 and 10 with λ = 0.99.  
The performance of the first improves and for the second 
becomes worse with respect to examples 2 and 1.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Using a suitable partition of the 4th order statistics 
involved in (2), a recursive solution for the cepstral equation 
was formulated. Because of the high variance in the 
estimation of the 4th order statistics, the recursive approach 
was based on orthogonal Q-R decompositions of the 
partioned data matrices which consist the cepstral equation. 
By means of simulation examples, it was demonstrated that 
the proposed algorithm is capable to detect transients of 
unknown arrival times. Comparing this technique with a fast 
adaptive algorithm based on an IIR model for the signal, 
significant improvement in terms of signal detection 
capability 
was 
demonstrated. 
Future 
work 
could 
investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm in 
the presence of i.i.d. noise with probability density 
function which follows non Gaussian distribution either 
symmetric (for example non-skewed) or asymmetric.
