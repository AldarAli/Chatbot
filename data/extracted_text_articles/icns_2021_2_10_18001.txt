Abstract— Efficient utilization of wireless resources is 
becoming more important with increasing data traffic being 
over wireless networks, especially multimedia traffic. Since the 
display panels in mobile devices are getting bigger and having 
a higher resolution, video streaming over a wireless network 
becomes a more challenging problem. Multiple Radio Access 
Technology (Multi-RAT) system is one of the solutions for 
streaming high-quality video through wireless channels since 
most mobile devices are equipped with multiple radio 
technologies, such as Wi-Fi and LTE. Moreover, scalable video 
is suitable to adaptively change the quality of the video 
depends on the wireless channel condition. In this research, 
optimal rate distribution through the Wi-Fi and the LTE will 
be derived to efficiently utilize both wireless technologies to 
transmit video to provide the best video quality to the user 
equipped with Wi-Fi and LTE. 
Keywords- Multi-RAT, SVC, integer programming. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The Multi-RAT system can achieve a high data rate by 
using multiple data paths [1][2]. Long-Term Evolution 
(LTE) technology allows users to use both licensed and 
unlicensed spectrum to transmit data. When the licensed 
channels are congested because of a large number of users, 
LTE can off-load its data to an unlicensed spectrum. There 
are two ways to offload the data to an unlicensed spectrum. 
First, License Assisted Access (LAA) utilizes unlicensed 
spectrum by aggregate licensed spectrum and unlicensed 
spectrum. In this case, LTE users occupy a certain amount of 
unlicensed spectrum. Second, LTE can transmit its data over 
an unlicensed spectrum using Wi-Fi protocol. LTE users 
should fairly compete with Wi-Fi users in this case. We 
design our Multi-RAT system based on the second option 
because it fairly shares the unlicensed spectrum with Wi-Fi 
users. Figure 1 shows the overall system architecture 
transmitting Scalable Video Coded (SVC) video through Wi-
Fi and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) channel [3]. First, the 
source video is coded, and it will be separated as multiple 
video layers which are composed of a single base layer and 
several enhancement layers. Second, depending on the 
channel quality, we will decide the number of layers to be 
transmitted. Third, the bit streams will be distributed to Wi-
Fi and LTE channels to provide the best video quality to the 
user. Since the channel characteristics of Wi-Fi and LTE are 
different, the channel characteristics will be used to decide 
what portion of the data will be transmitted through the Wi-
Fi and LTE, respectively. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 
II, we present a problem formulation. Section III presents a 
problem-solving strategy. Section IV presents simulation 
results and Section V concludes the paper.

PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is the most popular 
way to measure the Quality of Experience (QoE) for video. 
However, in wireless communication settings, the receiver 
has no information about the original video and cannot 
measure the PSNR while still receiver also need to measure 
the QoE to adaptive rate control to efficiently utilize the 
wireless resource. Since SVC video has several data streams, 
receiver can estimate the QoE by counting the number of 
video layer successively received. For example, if the 
receiver has 4-video layers, then it will have better video 
quality than the receiver having 3-video layers. Therefore, 
this project focused to maximize the number of layers. 
The optimization problem can be formulated as (1), 
which is maximizing utility function subject to the data rate 
constraint (2)~(5) of LTE and Wi-Fi channels. Defined 
utility is summation of all the layer’s estimated utilities 
successfully received, where u is the QoE model from [4]. 
LTE and Wi-Fi have different PHY and MAC layer design, 
but both technologies are using OFDM as a fundamental data 
allocation. Therefore, we can estimate the throughput of each 
channel by using the number of sub-carriers allocated for the 
user in our interest.

PROBLEM SOLVING 
To solve the optimization problem, logarithm is taken to 
simplify the problem. Then, the problem turns out to be the 
integer linear programming problem. We can relax the 
problem to a general linear programming problem and 
rounding the result to get the integer results.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
Matlab and Joint Scalable Video Model (JSVM) 
software [6] were used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. 
Fig 2. shows the simulation results with different settings. 
We assume that the available number of resources are 
 and 
. Fig 2(a). shows the packet 
distribution results with no overhead, where the overhead 
 means required amount of resource to avoid collision in 
Wi-Fi network. Fig 2(b) shows the packet distribution when 
the overhead 
, which is the case that Wi-Fi 
cannot fully utilize its resource to avoid congestion. Fig 2(c) 
shows the packet distribution when the channel condition of 
LTE is worse than the channel condition of Wi-Fi. The

simulation results show that the proposed algorithm 
allocates more video packets to more reliable network.  
For the comparison, equal data distribution and 
switching algorithm were also implemented. Equal data 
distribution only distributes the data to two channels with 
the same data rate. The switching algorithm selects the one 
channel which has better channel gain than other. Fig 3. 
shows that the proposed algorithm has the best PSNR. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Multi-RAT is a useful technology for streaming videos, 
since it can achieve better data rate than using only one 
channel at once. Moreover, if we distribute the data in an 
optimal way, the receiver will get better quality video. We 
proposed the optimal solution for data distribution between 
LTE and Wi-Fi and found that the proposed scheme can 
provide better quality video. The proposed algorithm will be 
expanded to 5G license assisted access (LAA) as a future 
work.
