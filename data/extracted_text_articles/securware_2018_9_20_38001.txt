Abstract—
Maritime ports are intensive energy areas with
plenty of electrical systems that require an average power of
many
tens
of
megawatts
(MW).
Competiveness,
profits,
reduction of pollution, reliability of operations, and carbon
emission trading are important considerations for any port
authority. Current technology allows the use of a local micro-
grid of the size of tens of megawatts, capable of isolated
operation in case of emergency and moving toward a large
energy independency. Ownership of its grid permits a large
control on the prices of energy services and operation either on
local electric market or generally on dangerous emission.
Renewable energy generation has a large impact on costs since
it features a low marginal cost, but it is random in nature.
Since the smart grid is a critical asset within the port
infrastructure, it is a high-level target for cyber-attacks. Such
attacks are often based on malicious software (malware),
which makes use of a controlling entity on the network to
coordinate and propagate. In this paper, we examine the
characteristics
of
a
port
smart
grid
and
the
typical
characteristics of cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the potential
ways to recognize these cyber-attacks and suggestion for
effective countermeasures are also discussed.
Keywords-Smart grid; maritime ports; energy efficiency; cyber
attacks.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The aim of this paper is to describe advantages of
utilization of smart micro-grids in port areas and the
requirements to protect them effectively from cyber-attacks.
The paper stresses the advantages of this approach as a key
factor of port competitiveness. Typical features of cyber-
attacks against smart grid infrastructures are illustrated to
suggest possible foundations for development of future
research regarding mitigation and protection actions.
Efficient utilization of energy and sustainability of
generation are critically important for port authorities and
port operators due to obvious impacts on operational cost,
business continuity, compliance to emission regulations,
satisfaction for operators, attractiveness of the port and in
last instance its competiveness [1].
In
this
paper,
an
operator
is
defined
as
an
entity/organization active inside the port area that owns
infrastructures, plants and buildings that is; an operator can
perform simultaneously any of the following energy related
operations: use of energy, generation of energy or storage of
energy
and
change
of
generation
/demand
profile.
Furthermore, the port authority can assume the role of
market operator and consequently trade energy and services
internally and externally.
Port electrical demand originates by:
•
Civil
and
mechanical
structures
for
shipbuilding
activities and industrial installations, etc.
•
Cruise ship terminals.
•
Conveying systems, transfer towers, cranes, lighting
and stockyards, refrigerated container, terminals to
accommodate the movement of container
•
Lighting systems for parking areas, roads, railway
sidings, industrial shipbuilding yard
•
Conditioning and heating system
•
Electrical vehicles
From different points of view, port operators and port
authorities look for competitiveness and also for profits,
with a strong focus on energy efficiency and energy saving,
which are related but different concepts (as efficiency
implies savings but the vice versa is not necessarily true).
Demand and generation have a flexible pattern in relation to
the growth of port activities.
As per Theodoropoulos [2], energy efficiency and
reduction of emissions is achieved by:
•
Effective use of energy coming from traditional and
renewables generations
•
Enforce a general policy aimed to achieve the main
energy objectives of the port
•
Adjusting demand and supply of energy by flexible
demand management, instantaneous load shedding or
curtailment (both directions) and intelligent battery
storage [3]
•
Giving priority to
renewable energy as primary
resource
•
Constantly
moving
generation
and
utilization
of
equipment
to
the
their
respective
high
efficient
operating points

•
Maximizing the use of electric transportation within a
port
•
Providing all operators with greater awareness on
micro-grid status and current/forecasted prices in order
to permit to anybody the correct planning of its own
technical and economic operation
Protection of a smart micro-grid from cyber-attack is
essential. A smart micro-grids is characterized by a set of
distinctive
aspects
(extended
geographical
distribution,
unmanned sub-systems, strong interaction between logical
and
physical
level,
strong
requirements
on
service
continuity, use of Internet communication services) that
make traditional ICT defense techniques weaker or some
time ineffective.
The sensitivity towards potential cyber-attacks increases
in proportion to the growth of the complexity of micro grid
control and intelligence, and is amplified by:
•
Increasing
interconnection
also
based
on
public
networks between networks and micro grids, end users
and power generation parks
•
Increasing adoption of COTS (Commercial) Off-the-
Shelf products in control (operating systems, DBMS,
application software, etc.), and introduction of new
technological paradigms of the ICT sector (virtualized
systems)
•
Extensive
use
of
Internet
based
communication
networks
•
Data volume growth available and coming from non-
homogeneous sources [4].
Technological evolutions introduce new vulnerabilities
and criticalities of security and require accurate verification
of compatibility with the requirements specified for the
management of critical infrastructures.
The security context finds an additional dimension of
interpretation in the analysis of the level of danger of
potential attackers and their motivations, objectives and
technical capabilities. The need to prevent events arising
from
well-organized
attackers
with
strong
financial
capabilities, technical skills and the availability of state-of-
the-art technological tools is widely shared. These attackers
often have the ability to use "zero-day" vulnerabilities,
bypassing signature-based attack detection systems and
most current Prevention solutions / Detection of attacks.
Taking into account that the infrastructures of the
electrical micro-grid generate a high dependence of almost
all the other critical infrastructures and vital functions of the
port, it is evident the possible impact that could have for a
port a cyber-attack aimed at making these infrastructures not
operational.
In this scenario, characterized by the combination of
relevant factors, such as the logical-physical nature of the
infrastructure, the need to guarantee a high level of
continuity of service and the threat of technically competent
and well-organized attackers, more needs arise, especially in
field of attack prevention such as:
•
the acquisition of feedback regarding the level of
security of the physical infrastructure
•
the correlation of information coming from the ICT
security domain, physical security and Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).
•
requirement of very low reaction times
In this scenario, an attacker could design malicious
activities based on the contemporary perturbation of the
SCADA and of physical equipment, but it could also
operate a coordinated series of actions that could cause
unexpected behavior of the micro-grid.
This
situation
greatly
complicates
the
micro-grid
security monitoring practices and the applicability of the
technologies available today in ICT field.
II.
WHY A SMART MICRO-GRID
A smart micro-grid is not a new concept since many
large industrial areas and some ports are already operating
an internal electrical grid powered by internal generation
and connected to an external utility.
Irrespective of its smartness, a micro-grid consists of two
major parts: on the one hand, the electrical infrastructure,
i.e. the smart assets that generate, deliver, transform, protect
and use energy and, on the other hand, communication and
control systems, i.e., bidirectional communication and
control system (SCADA) that operates the whole electrical
smart micro-grid [5].
Most ports still use “dumb” micro-grids at certain
marginal cost, rigidity of operations, level of reliability and
resiliency.
This
implementation
has
a
number
of
shortcomings, such as:
•
Difficulty to fully exploit the potential of internal
generation resources (often renewables such that large
arrays of Photo Voltaic (PV) modules, biogas gas fired
turbines, wind turbines, storage batteries, etc.)
•
Difficulty to establish a customizable tariff policy that
meets reward and economic and technical expectation
of operators and remunerate them without tantalizing
micro-grid
performance
and
violating
contractual
requirements with the utility
•
No
easy
way
to
support
different
control
and
regulations services required by external utility and by
internal continuous activity related requirements, a fact
that has an economic impact
•
Difficulty to establish a customizable tariff policy that
meets reward and economic expectation of operators
without tantalizing grid
performance and
exceed
contractual requirements
•
Limited flexibility to server changing operators’ needs
•
Less reliability and resilience of dumb micro-grid
•
Small possibility to trade services and actuate policies
such as “Demand Response” (DR) and exploit “Time
of Usage Tariff” (TOU).

A
smart
micro-grid
generally
overcomes
these
shortcomings,
provides
many
other
benefits
[6]
and
therefore is a sensible solution to make a port an efficient
and competitive infrastructure from the energy point of
view.
Last but not least, a smart micro-grid provides a
significant
contribution
to
the
process
of
generating
revenues for port authority and operators. These revenues
compensate some or all of the capital and operating costs
incurred by operators during the micro-grid life cycle.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) defines a micro
grid as: “A group of interconnected loads and distributed
energy resources with clearly defined electrical boundaries
that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the
grid and can connect to and disconnect from the grid to
enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode”
[7].
As stated in the “Micro-grid technology white paper”
written by Muni-Fed – Antea Group Energy Partners, LLC
in 2016, micro-grids are designed to allow delivering of
excess energy into the incumbent utility grid as well as to
import energy from the utility grid [11]. A micro-grid is a
small-scale version of the traditional utility grid designed to
optimize energy services through its intelligent pervasive
controls, they can operate completely separated (that is
islanded) from the utilities outside grid if properly sized
internal generation and storage is provided.
Therefore,
economic
and
technical
objectives
are
enabling
factors
for
a
smart
micro-grid
deployment.
Economic objectives aim to reach cost reductions and to
stream revenues coming from operations of the smart
micro-grid, specifically arbitrage/trading, minimization of
cost associated to procurement of energy (including supply
and bilateral contracts), correct definition of procurement
contracts, avoiding penalties due to non-compliance with
contractual terms (peaks, valleys, supply of services,
emissions, etc.). Regarding the technical aspects, the
fundamental objective is to deploy a stable, resilient, cyber-
secure and reliable smart micro-grid capable of delivering
high quality energy at the best prices to operators in relation
to their past, present and forecasted behavior. These
objectives are a function of availability of functionality,
such as:
•
Control at different levels capable to provide a cost
effective, reliable durable, sustainable electric system
able to serve efficiently its operators
•
Enable independent (off the grid) operations in case of
external adverse electrical conditions
•
Reduce risk of general electrical collapse of micro-grid
and
permit
faster
detection,
identification,
isolation/clearing of fault and fast restoration to a
normal state of operations
•
Mitigate of the consequences of energy fluctuations
through dispatching energy storage and switchable
loads
•
Improve energy-related operational efficiencies and
coordinated use of energy storage systems
•
Ensure continuous delivery of energy
•
Face the stochastic nature of renewable generation
•
Reduce peak load exposed to the utility
•
Enable
cranes
with
independent
(often
diesel)
generation to inject excess of their generation, if
economically viable and technically reasonable, into
the micro-grid.
•
Enable Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Building
(V2B) operations for port fleet of electrical vehicles
•
Enable deployment and sound utilization of a Virtual
Power Plant (VPP)
•
Use
energy
normally
wasted
owing
to
braking
operation through regenerative breaking.
III.
MICRO-GRID DESIGN
Micro-grid design starts from specific port specifications
like size of initial load and generation, its evolution as well
mode of utilization of external energy supplies, operation
schedules, and economic investment. Design Analysis is
supported by some forecasting methods (e.g., it is possible
to use spatial load forecasting, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), time series analysis, Kernel Auto-Regressive Model
with Exogenous Inputs (KARX), etc.
The preliminary design of electric micro-grid is done
using network analysis packages such as loads and power
flow, state estimation, stability and transient stability,
voltage profiles, contingency analysis, etc.
Design Analysis is performed under various scenarios
including the worst conditions, synchronization capability
in connected and disconnected mode. Finally, risk analysis
techniques like FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis)
and FMECA (Failure Mode and Effect and Criticalities
Analysis)
are
carried
out
as
well
to
complete
the
preliminary project and permit an objective evaluation.
These
analyses
are
prerequisite
for
micro-grid
risk
management.
The smart micro-grid is also designed to support a “plug
in type” approach to allow an easy horizontal and vertical
upgrade as well as a seamless addition and integration of
new equipment or replacement of existing one with a
minimum of reconfiguration of existing configuration and
reducing the risk of temporarily downgrading of the service.
While the micro-grid planning criteria may come from a
variety of sources, the most common is the need for high
grid resilience to maintain active critical services during
extended
utility
outages;
other
criteria
include
the
increasing use of renewables, reducing emissions, managing
energy costs and improving energy self-reliance, leading to
state government regulations and incentives. (See figure 1).

Figure 1. Micro-grid Design
Critical (that is must serve), no-critical loads and
generating and storage farms are assigned to different
feeders. Critical feeders are powered by dedicated
generators and backed by their own storage so that
required level of operability is always ensured.
For design purposes operators are categorized as
active controllable or uncontrollable being the difference
represented by the level of controllability, capability to
respond
to
outside
request
to
adjust
load
and/or
generation profile and finally level of local intelligence.
Design adheres to a general form of control that is
hierarchical and decentralized, that means
•
Each controllable operator can operate according to
its own objective, preferences and policy
•
Policy and objectives of the whole micro-grid are
established by the controller at the highest level of
the hierarchy
•
A set of coordination principles takes into account
the interaction of the processors (i.e. the fact they
operate on their own according to a specific
policy).
IV.
CYBER-SECURITY ASPECTS OF SMART
GRIDS
The cyber information security plays a fundamental
role in management of smart micro-grids due to their
strategic nature, since they represent the basis for the
operation of several critical port infrastructures [11].
Because of this strategic role and considering the
massive presence of intelligent components in the smart
grid sector, the cyber-security of the smart micro grids
(which includes attack prevention, detection, mitigation
and resilience) represents a challenge for the future at
the base of the research to be carried out. It is useful to
reach the definition of models that are able to quantify
potential
consequences
of
a
cyber-attack
on
the
electricity grid, and this in terms of pressure drops,
stability violations, and damage to equipment and / or
economic losses.
According to a joint study by Iowa State University
and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
after an appropriate risk assessment, the next step should
be the development of an integrated set of security
algorithms that can protect the network from multiple
forms of cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks,
malware-based attacks, etc. Such algorithms should take
into consideration very sophisticated attacking modeled
that could potentially cause a maximum level of
damage. According to this study algorithms to mitigate
the risk of an ICT attack should be developed through
real-time correlation of the data streams and registers
obtained
from
substations
and
control
centers,
algorithms that can prevent, detect and tolerate as well
as mitigate cyber-attacks [8].
The protocols used in the SCADA, such as the inter-
Control Center Communications Protocol ICCP also
known as International Electro Technical Commission
(IEC)/60870-6/Telecontrol Application Service Element
2 (TASE.2) [9], IEC 61850, Distributed Network
Protocol 3 (DNP3) [10] (derived by GE-Harris from IEC
60870-5), if not properly protected, could potentially be
used as carriers to launch cyber-attacks. This requires
secure versions of these protocols.
A. Kinds of Cyber- Attacks to Smart Grids
A first type of attacks on the grid is represented by
the "Intrusions": this type refers to exploiting the
vulnerabilities of software and communication between
the network infrastructures that then provides access to
critical elements of the system. The "Malware" instead
consists of malicious software that aims to exploit the
existing
vulnerabilities
in
the
software
system,
programmable logical controllers, or protocols. Once the
malware has gained access, it will try to cause damage
in the system using the self-propagation mechanism.
The "Denial of service attacks aim to make services
or resources managed by an organization unavailable for
an indefinite period of time, denying the possibility to
legitimate users of access them. This type of attack can
aim to submerge the communication network (or a
single server) with high volumes of traffic or loads of
work to inhibit the operation of the attack lens.
Further, "Insider threats" are considered a great
danger, by virtue of the privileged position that the
potential attacker has, as it can operate from within the
organization. Finally, "Routing attacks", in which cyber-
attacks occur on internet routing infrastructures, should
not be underestimated. Although this type of attack is
not directly related to grid operations, it could have
consequences on power system applications. Generally,
it includes the following:
•
Spear-phishing emails (from compromised
legitimate accounts),
•
Watering-hole domains,
•
ICS infrastructure targeting and credential
gathering
•
Host-based exploitation,
•
Industrial control
•
Open-source reconnaissance

B. Electrical Supply System: Vulnerability of Control
Systems
From a functional point of view, the micro-grids
divided into: generation and storage, transmission and
distribution.
Each functional division corresponds to systems
whose task is the control of specific machines/devices.
Each functional division has systems that control
specific machines/devices and operate using dedicated
communication
signals
and
protocols.
In
this
perspective, it is clear that each control system is
subjected to specific vulnerabilities; in fact, they could
constitute vectors of threats with a consequent potential
impact on the operations of the whole supply system.
Figure 2 shows a typical cyber-physical system.
Figure 2. A typical cyber-physical system [12]
Resilience features of micro-grid control systems, includes
•
Minimization of the occurrence of outages
•
Mitigation of any unwanted incidents
•
Minimization of the impact of outages
•
Restoration of the normal working conditions of the
grid in short time.
C. Smart and Micro- Grid: Cyber- Security Aspects
Cyber-security plays a very important role as observed in
many ongoing projects, recommendations and standards, in
particular in the United States NIST (National Institute of
Standards and Technology) and within the EU by European
Network
and
Information
Security
Agency
(ENISA).
However, there is currently no common approach and
technology for applications in SCADA systems and this is
even truer for the Smart Grids.
Therefore, in the specific case instead of investigating
and proposing new technologies, we try to improve the
process
of
defining
the
appropriate
and
measurable
requirements of cyber-security for the micro-grid in order to
define a realistic, efficient and scalable solution.
Computer
security
is
an
essential
feature
for
the
reliability of any control system today and is to be
considered from the beginning of any project and not as an
additional final component, as it sometimes happens. On the
other hand, Cyber-Security for a smart micro-grid must be
“smart” by itself, based on cost benefit and risk analysis,
with negligible effect, if any, on performances.
In this
context, it is reasonable to recommend analysing from the
beginning the specific needs of electrical equipment and the
interconnections of data exchange [13].
Nowadays, the dedicated technology for ICS (Industrial
control system) Cyber-Security consists mainly in analysis
of network traffic at connection points relevant to the
distributed control system. Current solutions range from
easily configurable systems, which require traffic rules
explicit and simple to self-learning machines that can
separate autonomously normal and abnormal traffic, after a
period of unsupervised training.
The "Defence in depth" is still at the initial stage and it's
more expensive than filtering traffic, but it increases
security of the single control nodes, independently of their
interconnected topology. This approach is expected to
become very valid, but in general it is justifiable only for
new installations, while in other cases a mix between in-
depth and filtering must be evaluated.
A good compromise for the choice has been proposed in
the standard ANSI/ISA-99 [14], based on security zones
and connection gateways. The term "Zone" means a
grouping of logical or physical assets that share common
safety requirements, based on factors such as criticality or
others. The gateway connects different zones, is able to
resist Denial of Service (DoS) or the injection of malware
via back doors and protects the integrity and privacy of
traffic on the network. The techniques of encapsulating
areas guarantee the protection of much more areas from
public networks; the deeper the encapsulation of an area is,
the greater is its security.
There are several kinds of attacks to smart grids [15]:
Disruption attacks
Attacks whose purpose is the overpressure of a service
for a certain period of time, creating an unavailability of the
same usefulness for the purposes of decision-making
processes:
•
DDoS-attacks from outside targeting inside assets
(Inbound attacks)
•
DDoS-attacks from inside targeting inside assets
(Internal attacks)
•
DDoS-attacks from inside attacking targets outside
(Outbound attacks)

SECURWARE 2018 : The Twelfth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

•
DDoS-attacks
on
certain
user
groups
(selective
harassment)
Destruction attacks
Unlike the interruption where the service can be restored
after
the
attack,
with
destruction
very
often
the
infrastructure must be rebuilt:
•
Disconnect households
•
Destroy energy management
•
Influence critical electrical nodes in the grid
•
Alteration of sensor data
•
Tamper with clock synchro
Theft
Stealing a commodity such as information to reveal to
competitors:
•
Espionage
•
Ruin credibility of users:
•
Sell long term data:
•
Bill manipulation
Extortion schemes
Extortion attempts for demanding ransom achieving the
releasing a captured:
•
Commodity or service
•
Threat of destruction
•
Threat of DDoS
•
Crypto-locker
Repurpose attacks
•
Fake servers
•
Proxies
•
Distributed computing
D. Cyber-Security Objectives: Functional Improvements
and Processes
The objectives of cyber-security are divided into
functional improvements of process:
•
Customized
off-the-shelf
solution,
integrated
into
nodes (such as firewalls, hardening mechanism, strong
authentication) and communication channels (such as
Virtual Private Network (VPN) and encryption);
•
An event correlator based on an active fault tree and
supported
by symptom detection technique tools
analyses
incidents,
identifies
abnormal
ones
and
searches for hidden patterns among them. This event
correlator is often associated with a security console
which can be seen as a "mini security operation
centre", such as decision support for the management
of physical and logical security of the whole system.
Furthermore, non-functional objectives are associated with
the procedures, e.g.:
•
A new approach to the priority of the security
requirements of logical components of Smart Grids,
based on a specific analysis of risk weighted by
appropriate critical parameters in order to identify
reasonable, effective and timely countermeasures;
•
A consequent logical partition of the smart or micro-
grid in zones and communication channels that share
security
requirements
homogeneous,
allowing
to
customize cascade countermeasures.
A potential growing danger is the possibility that the
supervision and control system (SCADA) of the micro-grid
is deceived by false data coming from compromised
peripheral units (RTUs, PLCs, Smart Inverters and other
smart equipment) or through interconnections with other
systems that are the object of successful attack. It is
essential to distinguish between "genuine" data, incorrect
data, whose error depends on malfunctioning of the
peripheral instrumentation or the RTU "and data whose
origin is dubious (potentially affected by malicious attacks).
Methods for continuous monitoring of the security status of
the infrastructure, through the acquisition, analysis and
correlation of relevant data are key factors for security.
It is reasonable to use attack identification techniques
based on the continuous analysis of safety events, states,
alarms, measurements and commands coming / sent to the
SCADA, from Metering and from ICT security systems. An
appropriate use of these techniques allows to evaluate the
overall behavior of the infrastructure, highlighting

Presence
of
attacks
(discriminating
from
really
incorrect, but genuine, information)

Changes in the level of risk.
A sophisticated attacker can attempt to modify the
behavior of a SCADA and, in particular, directly or
indirectly influence data (states, measurements, alarms) and
commands (continuous and discrete) in such a way as to
mislead the supervision and control system, protection and
operators; what would trigger improper interventions, that in
turns may be detrimental to the integrity of the equipment
and interfere with the continuity of the service.
It is necessary to use techniques for the continuous
monitoring of the safety of electrical infrastructures and to
build identification of models to detect attacks.
It is useful to focus on the definition of methods for
dynamically identifying the dependencies of the operational
process of the micro-grid towards all the technologies
served to it. In particular it necessary to study:
•
the acquisition, standardization and correlation of
security events coming from SCADA systems, from
ICT systems with these correlated, from physical
security systems

•
determination of the stability status of the micro-grid
by evaluating the data acquired in real time by the PV,
systems
•
the continuous monitoring of all the parameters
describing the safety status of the logical, physical
structures and the level of regularity and stability of
the
operational
process,
with
a
view
to
their
correlation.
V.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
The use of smart micro grid is to be promoted as a key
element for port competitiveness and compliance with
environmental regulations. Proper design of the micro-grid
leads to benefits of port authority, port operators and
external electrical utilities. It is important that the control
and management structure reflects the organization and
operation logics of port infrastructures, a fact that generally
leads to a distributed hierarchical structure and a pervasive
distribution of intelligence. Electrical and financial analysis
supported by powerful forecasting tools is required to
specify and deploy a micro grid that fit well with current
and future requirements of the port.
Modularity and
upgradability is equally important as well as very friendly
mode of operations.
Equally important is the cyber protection of the micro
grids either in its smart equipment and control and
information systems. This protection entails to points:
defense of the information and control system as well as of
communication infrastructure and recognition of electrical
status that is not genuine and that would trigger dangerous
control.
At the state of the art, in the face of a wide diffusion of
solutions
for
the
centralization
and
correlation
of
information security events it is possible to approach the
problem using currently available technologies and planning
developments aimed at extending the capacity of existing
solutions.
Comprehensive
control
system
with
specialized
optimizations tools needs to be developed together with
sophisticated monitoring techniques. The role of forecasting
and modeling cannot be neglected and its importance stems
either or from management requirements or security model
based constraints.
It should be noted that early recognition (in the order of a
few minutes) may be sufficient to undertake protective
actions and to initiate the resumption of operations. For
instance, it is important to design and develop monitoring
techniques capable of assessing whether and to what extent
the monitored system is deviating from the normal state due
to causes not due to actual failures or malfunctions. Equally
important is development of optimization methods that
decouple high and low level of control (that is port authority
and port operators) and compensate individual behavior in
line with high level policy and objectives.
Finally, a powerful but easily usable modeling and
evaluation techniques is recommended to help port authority
and operator to devise the best and long lasting solutions.
