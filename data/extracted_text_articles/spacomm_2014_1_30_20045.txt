Abstract‚ÄîThis paper describes the design of an essential 
component in wireless transceivers, the frequency synthesizer. 
The synthesizer is implemented using Phase Locked Loop 
(PLL). Second order PLL, type II, with a reference frequency 
10MHz is designed using 180nm analog CMOS process 
technology. The synthesizer generates signals in frequency 
range of 10-100 MHz. The simulated power consumption of the 
system is 37¬µW with a deviation from the true periodicity; root 
mean square periodic jitter is in range of 5 ps. 
 
Keywords- PLL;  CMOS; ,frequency; synthesizer.

INTRODUCTION 
The main job of frequency synthesizer is to create a set of 
frequencies multiple of a reference frequency. Such 
specification can be made using three techniques: the look up 
table synthesizer, the direct/indirect synthesizer and Phase-
Locked Loop (PLL) synthesizers [1]. PLL frequency 
synthesizers offer high level of stability and accuracy 
determined by the crystal oscillator; they are also easy to 
control using a digital control circuit. PLL plays a major role 
in the field of communication systems [2][3], where the 
major target is saving battery energy, PLL is the most power 
consumer block in the transceiver [4]. Radio Frequency, 
nowadays, is used as the intermediate between the sensor 
unit and the computer for biomedical applications, mostly in 
the muscular stimulation (heart diseases) [5]. Any circuit 
within the chip should consume ultra-low power and area. In 
this paper, a PLL is proposed as a frequency synthesizer, 
based on Phase/Frequency Detector (PFD), Charge Pump 
(CP), Voltage Control Oscillator (VCO) and Frequency 
Divider (FD), which are implemented using 0.18¬µm CMOS. 
In order to minimize the power consumption, a lower supply 
voltage is used. N-divider is used to synthesize the Reference 
Frequency (Fref).  Targeting high output frequency needs 
high power consumption.  
In this paper, we discuss a compromise VHF PLL with a 
limited current budget. The paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents the theoretical background. Circuit design 
and simulation results are discussed in Section III. In Section 
IV, the summary of system performance is presented. 
Conclusion and future work are discussed in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM DESIGN AND BEHAVIORAL SIMULATION 
In this section, a behavioral model is introduced to define 
the system specs and ensure the system stability. PFD detects 
the phase and frequency error. CP and Loop Filter compute 
the phase error and convert it to average voltage information 
used by VCO, which creates a frequency synchronized with 
Fref.. 
 
 The system is modeled in Figure 1 using linear 
approaches; PFD/CP detects the error in the phase. VCO 
generates the output frequency from the input controlled 
voltage.

To ensure the system stability, from (2), a phase of HOL< 
180¬∞ should be guaranteed at the unity gain frequency (ft). 
PLL second order has two poles at DC (phase HOL(0) = 
180¬∞); a zero is introduced at low frequency to maintain the 
system stability. In contrast, Phase Margin (PM)>0, i.e., the 
system stability is guaranteed as shown in Figures 2. Figure 
3 shows the weak overshoot of the step response.

The maximum overshoot is often used as a measure of the 
relative stability of the control system. The settling time is

&'(. In our application, the time needed to achieve 
lock condition (constant input output phase difference), is 
not critical; thus, the unity gain frequency is used to be in 
order of 1MHz.The transfer function for Type II PLL has a 
low pass characteristic; as a result, slow jitter at the input 
propagates to the output, but fast jitter does not. On the 
other hand, the phase noise VCO transfer function is a high 
pass filter introduced in (3). Figure 4 presents the phase 
noise transfer functions of the input reference and the VCO. 
For that reason, in our design, the CP consumption has been 
reduced, while increasing the VCO current for a better 
phase noise at the frequency of interest, while respecting the 
estimated low power consumption budget.

CIRCUIT DESIGN AND SIMULATION 
A.  Phase Frequency Detector / Charge Pump/ Loop Filter 
PFD is a circuit that measures the phase and frequency 
difference between the signal that comes from the VCO and 
the reference signal. Outputs pulses (Down & Up) have 
widths proportional to the phase error. Figure 5 presents a 
PFD using 2 True Single-Phase-Clock (TSPC) D-Flip-Flop 
[6]. Clocks are exploited for resetting; Fref to reset Ffb and 
vice versa. In comparison to the conventional PFD, the AND 
gate, generating the reset signal [7], is removed. The delay 
due to the propagation of the signal will be saved. The CP 
converts the error in phase to current information. It has 
three states as illustrated in Table I.

The main feature of the architecture shown in Figure 6 is 
the reduction of dead zone (the delay needed on CP digital 
command signals to avoid all ones condition) and the 
guarantee of a safe operation without any CP current glitches 
on the Loop Filter (LF) capacitance. PFD design is suitable 
for fast PLL operating at higher frequency; we should 
guarantee that the maximum delay of the PFD is greater than 
the CP switching speed in order to target a zero PFD dead 
zone.  
B. Voltage Controlled Osicllator  
The main part of the system is the VCO, based on ring 
oscillator [8], and designed by a ring connection between 
five inverters [9]. The charging and discharging currents are 
equal, both depend linearly on Vctrl. The Fosc is proportional 
to both currents. Thus, Fout of the presented architecture 
varied linearly withVctrl.

Two series of inverters are used as a buffer to protect the 
oscillation. When the VCO is close to its steady state, the 
phase and frequency of the output clock are adjusted slightly 
to match the phase and frequency of the input reference 
clock.

D. Simulation Results 
Once the lock is achieved, as shown in Figure 10, after 
settling time 4¬µs, shown in Fig (8), the output clock would 
be equal to N√óFref.

filter capacitor as it will saturate when the output clock 
matches the reference clock frequency.

CONCLUSIONAND FUTURE WORK 
The paper presented a designed PLL with low power 
consumption and small loop capacitance. PFD uses 
reference and feedback clock to reset each other; UP and 
DOWN signals don‚Äôt get high simultaneously, yield to low 
glitches for a small loop capacitance value, which is the gain 
as we kept low area required for the application. 
     CP current is reduced given that its phase noise transfer 
function is a LPF (decay in the band of interest) while a 
VCO large current to reduce its output phase noise given 
that its  phase noise transfer function is a HPF. System and 
design are done to optimize the power consumption. System 
stability is guaranteed as PM >60¬∞. 
 
      In our future work, we target designing this PLL to 
operate at higher frequency; for that reason, we have 
discussed above about the condition for zero PFD dead 
zone.
