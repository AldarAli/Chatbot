 INTRODUCTION 
Microparticle separation techniques have attracted 
extensive attention for their importance in clinical 
diagnostics, treatment, and various biomedical applications. 
Most common separation techniques involve centrifugation 
and membrane based filtration on macro scale systems. 
Microfluidics based particle separation systems have 
advantages over these techniques due to small amounts of 
sample and reagent, less time consumption, lower cost and 
high throughput. In general, separation techniques could be 
categorized as passive and active with respect to any 
available applied external forces. Active separation systems 
require external forces such as ultrasound, magnetic field, 
and dielectric field for controlling the behavior of the 
particles suspended in fluid [1–2]. Passive separation 
techniques do not require external forces; the separation 
relies entirely on the hydrodynamic effects, which are mainly 
caused by channel geometry. However, most of the passive 
separation systems suffer from low throughput and filtration 
efficiency due to low channel Re numbers [1–2].  
The 
first 
experiment 
about 
inertial 
forces 
was 
accomplished by Segre and Silberberg [3] in which particles 
migrate to a radial equilibrium position at the pipe radius of 
0.62 from the axis of the pipe, which is known as “Tubular 
Pinch Effect”. Working with a wide range of Re numbers, 
Matas et al. [4] experimentally confirmed the tubular pinch 
effect and found that the equilibrium positions shift towards 
the wall with increasing Re. Kim et al. [5] observed that 
particles focused to a narrow band along the perimeter, 
which is about 0.2 Dh (hydraulic diameter) in low Re number 
(Re < 20). On the other hand, Di Carlo et al. [6] investigated 
the inertial focusing in a straight microchannel and proved 
that uniformly distributed particles in rectangular channels 
migrate across the streamlines of four symmetric equilibrium 
positions at the centers of the sides and move closer to the 
walls as particle Re number increases. Lateral migration of 
particles mainly depends on the ratio of the particle diameter 
to the channel hydraulic diameter (ap/Dh). Inertial effects are 
significantly large and particle focusing occurs in short 
distances in ap/Dh > 0.07 criterion. They also point out that 
the focusing positions that occur in the straight channels can 
be determined by the fold symmetry of the channel’s cross 
section. In a rectangular channel the flow will have two 
focusing positions [7]. Di Carlo et al. [8] also studied the 
equilibrium positions of cells with comparing the expanding 
channel types. It was determined that the equilibrium 
positions moved closer to the channel centerline in rapid 
expanding channel while they were closer to the channel 
wall in the gradual expanding channel. Recently, Asgar et al. 
[9] discovered that the inertial focusing positions of particles 
in a straight microchannel also depend on the channel aspect 
ratio. They found that particles converge to an equilibrium in 
two focused streams along the longer sidewalls for both H/W 
> 1 and W/H > 1 (H: Height, W: Width) at the same channel 
Re number. Shear gradient induced lift force is linked to the 
flow velocity profile at the location of the particle. Due to its 
larger weight and size, the particle moves a little more 
slowly than the fluid and relative velocity is larger on the 
wall side, a pressure difference acts on the particle to push it 
towards to the wall. The second lift force where induced lift 
force is linked to the vicinity of the solid surface is called as 
wall effect. The relative velocity closed to the wall side of 
the particle is reduced by the presence of the wall, and the 
pressure on the wall side is larger than that on the centerline 
side. A lift force is exerted on the particle towards the 
channel center. 
In this study, straight microfluidic channels with 
contracting and expanding geometry are studied. The angles 
in the entrance of contacting part of the channel are varied 
and the influence of the forces on the particle focusing is 
measured at various fluid flow rates.

MICROCHANNEL DESIGN 
The angle of the entrance to contraction part was varied 
while other parameters were kept constant. Schematic view 
of the designed channel geometry is shown in Fig. 1, and 
dimensions are given in Table 1.

METHODS 
A. Fabrication 
SU – 8 3050 (MicroChem Corp.) was spun on the 4 inch 
Si wafer at 500 rpm for 10 s with 100 rpm/s acceleration and 
then 3000 rpm for 30 s with 300 rpm/s acceleration. A soft 
bake process was done at 95 °C for 15 min. After 
lithography, SU–8 coated wafer was post baked at 65 °C for 
1 min. following at 95 °C for 5 min, and developed. Then it 
was placed in a petri dish for PDMS casting. Vacuum oven 
was used for degassing the PDMS and kept at the curing 
temperature of 150 °C for 2 hours. After curing, PDMS was 
peeled off the mold and placed in oxygen plasma furnace 
with a glass substrate side by side for the surface treatment to 
improve the adhesion between PDMS and glass, then both 
pieces were bonded together for the final construction of the 
microfluidic device.

B. Characterization 
A mixture of 0.04 ml solution containing 1% of 9.9µm 
diameter green fluorescent particles and 70 mL DI water was 
prepared.  Flow rates were determined with respect to the 
particle Re numbers (ReP). It has been shown that particle 
inertial lift forces are dominant when Rep > 1, causing the 
particles to migrate laterally inside the channels [10]. Flow 
rates and particle Re numbers used in this study are given in 
Table 2. 
For obtaining a stable image from green fluorescent 
particles, exposure rate and color were adjusted with respect 
to red, green and blue. Exposure rates were varied between 
the values of 80 µs to 160 µs in which microchannel borders 
are not visible so that the particle images could easily be 
viewed. For obtaining an image over time, accumulation 
settings were set at 40 frames, meaning each image taken 
contains accumulated 40 frames.

RESULTS AND DıSCUSSıON 
A. Focusing Positions 
Using the line profile option of the DP72 microscope 
camera software, the positions of the accumulated particle 
flows images were obtained. The line profile system depends 
on the RGB color value of the points along the chosen line. 
From the RGB values focusing width and position were 
determined. The obtained images showing the focusing 
positions of the micro channels are given in Fig. 2. It can be 
seen from the figure highly concentrated single focusing can 
be obtained at certain flow rates for angled designs (30° - 45° 
- 60°) at the upper side of the channel for certain flow rates 
while this could not be possible for 90° degree design.  
B. Intensity Analysis  
The brightness of the color image can be obtained with 
using the line profile option of the microscope. By using 
color intensity values it can be determined whether a certain 
flow rate can produce a single focus or a dual focus 
positions.  While the intensity values give the value of the 
brightness of the focusing, that value needs to be adjusted 
with respect to the width of the focus in order to normalize 
the intensity value. Single focusing could be categorized as 
high intensity over low width values.  In other words, in 
order to define a single focusing position for a certain flow 
rate, its intensity/width value must be much higher than that 
of its second focusing position value. Furthermore, for the 
single focusing position determination at different flow rates 
intensity/width value is divided by the flow rate values to 
normalize the color intensity with respect to flow rate. The 
obtained results are shown in Fig. 3. Left side of each graph 
corresponds to expansion region of the channel while the 
right side corresponds to contraction part of the channel. 
From the graphs, for a certain ReP value whether a focusing 
position is single or double is seen. Mark x shows the single 
focusing positions. For 45 and 60 degree designs have single 
focusing for two different flow rates in the contraction part 
of the channel while 30 degree design has only one and 90 
degree design has none.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
Single focusing position could be achieved for a 
certain flow rate and an angle of inclination at the entrance 
of a contracting part in the direction of flow. This result 
can be explained with the vortex forces prior to the 
contraction part and the wall effect at the proposed angle. 
Fig. 4 illustrates these forces affecting the particle in the 
channel. From this figure, the x component of the vortex 
force will be decreasing with decreasing angle. This force 
is in the direction of the flow causing an increase in the 
flow rate. But that effect will not have significant effect at 
low angle values causing no change in the flow rate.  In 
60°, 45° and 30° channel designs there exists a wall 
induced inertial lift force which affects prior to the 
contracting part. This lift force is perpendicular to the 
angled wall so that its x and y components are not same 
for different angle values. It has lower x component in 
lower angled designs. The x component of this wall 
induced inertial lift force has a decelerating effect for the 
fluid and particle flow and the y component of this wall 
induced inertial lift force is the main driving force for 
obtaining the single focusing position. The x component of 
the wall induced lift force of 60° design is higher than that 
of 45° or 30° design, at which the fluid flow will be 
affected more and its flow rate will be lower than those 
designs. As a result, a single focus was obtained in even 
expansion part of the channel at certain flow rates for 60° 
design.
