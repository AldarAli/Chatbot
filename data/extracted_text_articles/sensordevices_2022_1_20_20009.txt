Abstract— Monitoring the network traffic status of 
urban roads in real-time can provide rich and high-
quality basic data and allow the assessment of traffic 
control effects. Our work focuses on the use of Visible 
Light 
Communication 
(VLC) 
as 
a 
support 
for 
transmission of information providing guidance to 
drivers, as well as specific information to them. 
Connected vehicles communicate with one another and 
with the infrastructure using street lights, street lamps, 
and traffic signals. As a result of joint transmission, 
optical mobile receivers collect data, calculate their 
location for positioning, and, correspondingly, read 
transmitted data from each transmitter. As receivers 
and decoders, optical sensors with light filtering 
properties, are used. To command the passage of 
vehicles safely queue/request/response mechanisms and 
temporal/space relative pose concepts are used. The 
results indicate that the V-VLC system increases safety 
by directly monitoring critical points such as queue 
formation and dissipation, relative speed thresholds, as 
well as inter-vehicle spacing.

INTRODUCTION 
The main objective of the Intelligent Transport System 
(ITS) technology is to optimize traffic safety and efficiency 
on public roads by increasing situation awareness and 
mitigating traffic accidents through vehicle-to-vehicle 
(V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications 
[1] [2] [3]. By knowing, in real time, the location, speed and 
direction of nearby vehicles, a considerable improvement in 
traffic management is expected. The goal is to increase the 
safety and throughput of traffic intersections using 
cooperative driving [4].  
The traffic data collected by the current traffic control 
system using induction loop detector and other existing 
sensors is limited. With the advancement of the wireless 
communication technologies and the development of the 
V2V and V2I systems, called Connected Vehicle, there is an 
opportunity to optimize the operation of urban traffic 
network by cooperation between traffic signal control and 
driving 
behaviors. 
In 
this 
area, 
Visible 
Light 
Communication (VLC) has a great potential for applications 
due to their relatively simple design for basic functioning, 
efficiency, and large geographical distribution. VLC is an 
emerging technology [5] that enables data communication 
by modulating information on the intensity of the light 
emitted by LEDs. In the case of vehicular communications, 
the use of VLC is made easier because all vehicles, street 
lights, and traffic lights are equipped with LEDs, using them 
for illumination, enabling the dual use of exterior 
automotive and infrastructure lighting for both illumination 
and communication purposes [6]. 
The adaptive traffic control strategy aims to respond to 
real-time traffic demand through current and predicted 
traffic flow data modeling. The adaptive traffic control 
system in a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) environment can 
collect more detailed information than the fixed coil 
detector, such as vehicle position, speed, queue length, and 
stopping time. While V2V links are particularly important 
for safety functionalities, such as pre-crash sensing and 
forward collision warning, I2V links provide the connected 
vehicles with a variety of useful information [7] [8]. 
Monitoring the network traffic status of urban roads in 
real-time can provide rich and high-quality basic data and 
allow the assessment of traffic control effects.  
Our work focuses directly on the use of VLC as a 
support for the transmission of information providing 
guidance services and specific information to drivers. This 
paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, in 
Section 2, the V-VLC communication link is described and 
the 
scenario, 
architecture, 
communication 
protocol, 
coding/decoding techniques analyzed. In Section 3, the 
experimental results are reported and the system evaluation 
performed. A phasing traffic flow diagram based on V-VLC 
is developed, as a Proof of Concept (PoC). Finally, in 
Section 4, the main conclusions are presented.

V-VLC COMMUNICATION LINK 
In this section, the transmitter and receiver of the 
proposed adaptive traffic control system are investigated 
concretely. The adaptive model is introduced specifically. 
A. 
System Design 
A V-VLC system consists of a transmitter to generate 
modulated light and a receiver to detect the received light 
variation located at the infrastructures and at the driving 
cars. Both the transmitter and the receiver are connected 
through the wireless channel.

Figure 1 illustrates the basic architecture of a VLC 
system. Both communication modules are software defined, 
where modulation/ demodulation can be programed.The 
VLC emitter has a dual purpose, emits light, and transmits 
data instantaneously by using the same optical power 
without any noticeable flickering. The digital VLC emitter 
module converts the binary data to intensity modulated light 
waves for transmission. A driving circuit controls the 
switching of the LED according to the incoming binary data 
at the given data rate, generating an amplitude modulated 
light beam. Here, the light produced by the LED is 
modulated 
with 
ON–OFF-keying 
(OOK) 
amplitude 
modulation [9].  
White light tetra-chromatic sources are used providing a 
different data channel for each chip. Each luminaire is 
composed of four white WLEDs framed at the corners of a 
square (see Figure 1b). They consist of red, green, blue and 
violet chips and combine the lights in correct proportion to 
generate white light. At each node, only one chip of the 
LED is modulated for data transmission, the Red (R: 626 
nm), the Green (G: 530 nm), the Blue (B: 470 nm) or the 
Violet (V). Modulation and digital-to-analog conversion of 
the information bits is done using signal processing 
techniques. Parasitic capacitance (traces and support 
circuitry) plays an important role in increasing the RC time 
constant and thus slowing transitions. However, the typical 
bit rates that can be supported by fast moving vehicles is 
usually limited by channel conditions, not by the switching 
speed of the LED.  
The visible light emitted by the LEDs passes through the 
transmission medium and is received by the MUX 
photodetector that acts as an active filter for the visible 
region of the light spectrum [10]. The device operation is 
displayed in Figure 1c. Independent tuning of each channel 
is 
performed 
by 
steady 
state 
violet 
optical 
bias 
superimposed from the front side of the device. The 
generated photocurrent is measured at -8V. The MUX 
photodetector multiplexes the different optical channels, 
perform 
different 
filtering 
processes 
(amplification, 
switching, and wavelength conversion) and decode the 
encoded signals, recovering the transmitted information. 
The LEDs are modeled as Lambertian sources where the 
luminance is distributed uniformly in all directions, whereas 
the luminous intensity is different in all directions [11]. The 
coverage map for a square unit cell is displayed in Figure 2. 
All the values were converted to decibel (dB).The nine 
possible overlaps (#1-#9), defined as fingerprint regions, as 
well as the possible receiver orientations (steering angles; ) 
are also pointed out for the unit square cell.

The received channel can be expresssed as y=µhx+n 
where y represents the received signal, x the transmitted 
signal, μ is the photoelectric conversion factor which can be 
normalized as μ = 1, h is the channel gain and n is the 
additive white Gaussian noise of which the mean is 0. The 
responsivity of the receiver depends on its physical structure 
and on the effective area collection. After receiving the 
signal, it is in turn filtered, amplified, and converted back to 
digital format for demodulation. The received signal power 
includes both the energy transmitted from the transmitter 
and from ambient light. The device receives multiple 
signals, finds the centroid of the received coordinates, and

stores it as the reference point position. Nine reference 
points, for each unit cell, are identified giving a fine-grained 
resolution in the localization of the mobile device across 
each cell (see Figure 2). The input of the guidance system is 
the coded signal sent by the transmitters to an identify 
vehicle (I2V), and includes its position in the network P(xi, 
yj), inside the unit cell (#1-#9) and the steering angle,  (2-
9) that guides the driver orientation across his path.

Scenario and Architecture   
The typical single intersection (four-legged intersection)  
is  attached  to  sixteen  roads,  eight  incoming from and  
eight outgoing to North, West, South, and East neighbor 
crossroads’ roads.  The simulated scenario is a traffic light 
controlled intersection as displayed in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Simulated scenario. V2X optical infrastructure and generated 
joint footprints in a split crossroad (LED array=RGBV color spots).  
Four traffic flows were considered. One is coming from 
West (W) with seven vehicles approaching the crossroad: 
five ai Vehicles with straight movement and three ci 
Vehicles with left turn only. In the second flow, three bi 
Vehicles from East (E) approach the intersection with left 
turn only. In the third flow, e Vehicle, oncoming from South 
(S), has right-turn approach. Finally, in the fourth flow, f 
Vehicle coming from North, goes straight. Road request and 
response segments, offer a binary (turn left / straight or turn 
right) choice.  
An orthogonal topology based on clusters of square unit 
cells was considered. The grid size was chosen in order to 
avoid an overlap in the receiver from the data in adjacent 
grid points. Each transmitter, X i,j, carries its own color, X, 
(RGBV) as well as its horizontal and vertical ID position in 
the surrounding network (i,j). In the PoC, was assumed that 
the crossroad is located in the intersections of line 4 with 
column 3. The emitters (street lamps) are located at the 
nodes along the roadside. Thus, each LED sends a I2V 
message that includes the synchronism, its physical ID and 
the traffic information. When a probe vehicle enters the 
streetlight´s capture range, the receiver replies to the light 
signal, and assigns a unique ID and the traffic message.

structure that can be used to create a gateway-free system.

Figure 4. Mesh and cellular hybrid architecture.  
The street lights are equipped with one of two types of 
nodes: A “mesh” controller that connects with other nodes 
in its vicinity. These controllers can forward messages to the 
vehicles (I2V) in the mesh, acting like routers nodes in the 
network. The other one is the “mesh/cellular” hybrid 
controller that is also equipped with a modem provides IP 
base connectivity to the Intersection Manager (IM) services. 
These nodes act as border-router and can be used for edge 
computing [12]. This architecture enables edge computing 
and device-to-cloud communication (I2IM), and enable 
peer-to-peer communication (I2I), to exchange information. 
It performs much of the processing on embedded computing 
platforms, directly interfacing to sensors and controllers. It 
supports geo-distribution, local decision making, and real-
time load-balancing.

As exemplified in Figure 5, the vehicle movement along 
the road can be thought as a queue, where the vehicles 
arrive at a lane, wait if the lane is congested and then move 
once the congestion reduces. For the intersection manager 
crossing coordination, the vehicle and the IM exchange 
information through two types of messages, “request” (V2I) 
and “response” (I2V). Inside the request distance, an 
approach “request” is sent, using as emitter the headlights. 
The “request” contains all the information that is necessary 
for a vehicle’s space-time reservation for its intersection 
crossing (speeds, and flow directions). IM uses this 
information to convert it in a sequence of timed rectangular 
spaces that each assigned vehicle needs to occupy the 
intersection. The objective is to let the IM knows the 
position of vehicles inside the environment at each step t 
A highly congested traffic scenario will be strongly 
connected. In order to determine the delay, the number of 
vehicles queuing in each cell at the beginning and end of the 
green time is determined by V2V2I observation, as 
illustrated in Figure 5a. An IM acknowledge is sent, 
“response” from the traffic signal over the facing receiver to 
the in car application of the head vehicle. Once the response 
is received (message distance in Figure 5, the vehicle is 
required to follow the provided occupancy trajectories 
(footprint regions, see Figure 2). If a request has any 
potential risk of collision with all other vehicles that have 
already been approved to cross the intersection, the control 
manager only sends back to the vehicle (V2I) the “response” 
after the risk of conflict is exceeded.

Color Phasing diagram 
A color phasing diagram for a four-legged intersection is 
shown in Figure 6. We have assumed four “color poses” 
linked with the radial range of the modulated light in the 
RGBV crossroad nodes [13].

The West straight, South left turn and West right turn

are related to South straight, East left turn, and South right 
turn maneuvers. "Blue poses" are related to East straight, 
North left turn, and East right turn maneuvers, and "violet 
poses" are related to North straight, West left turn, and 
North right turn maneuvers.  
 
D. 
Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Localization   
There are critical points where traffic conditions change: 
the point at which a vehicle begins to decelerate when the 
traffic light turns red (message distance), the point at which 
it stops and joins the queue (queue distance), the point at 
which it starts to accelerate when the traffic light turns green 
(request distance) or the points at which the coming vehicle 
is 
slowed 
by 
the 
leaving 
vehicle. 
With 
V2I2V 
communication, the travel time that influences traffic 
channelization in different routes can be calculated and real-
time data about speed, spacing, queues, and saturation can 
be collected across the queue, request and message 
distances. In Figure 7, the movement of the cars in 
successive moments is depicted with their colored poses 
(colored arrows) and qi,j spatial relative poses (dot line). 
We denote q(t), q(t´), q(t´´), q(t´´’) as the vehicle pose 
estimation at the time t, t´, t´´, t´´´ (request, response, enter 
and exit times), respectively. All the requests contain 
vehicle positions and approach speeds. If followers exist the 
request message from its leader includes the position and 
speed previously received by V2V. This information alerts 
the controller to a later request message (V2I), confirmed by 
the follow vehicle. In the PoC we have assumed that

among the vehicles poses and the local maps. For a vehicle 
with several neighboring vehicles, the mesh node uses the 
indirect V2V relative pose estimations method taking 
advantage of the data of each neighboring vehicle [13].

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 
A. 
Communication 
Protocol 
and 
Coding/Decoding 
Techniques 
To code the information, an On-Off keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used and it was considered a 
synchronous transmission based on a 64- bits data frame. 
The frame is divided into four, if the transmitter is a 
streetlamp or headlamp, or five blocks, if the transmitter is 
the traffic light. The first block is the synchronization block 
[10101], the last is the payload data (traffic message) and a 
stop bit ends the frame. The second block, the ID block 
gives the location (x, y coordinates) of the emitters inside 
the array (Xi,j,). Cell’s IDs are encoded using a 4 bits binary 
representation for the decimal number. The  block (steering 
angle ()) completes the pose in a frame time q(x,y, , t). 
Eight steering angles along the cardinal points and coded 
with the same number of the footprints in the unit cell 
(Figure 2) are possible from a start point to the next goal. If 
the message is diffused by the IM transmitter, a pattern 
[0000] follows this identification, if it is a request (R) a 
pattern [00] is used. The traffic message completes the 
frame.

Because the VLC has four independent emitters, the 
optical signal generated in the receiver can have one, two, 
three, or even four optical excitations, resulting in 24 
different optical combinations and 16 different photocurrent 
levels at the photodetector. As an example, in Figure 8, two 
response MUX signals received by vehicle c1 are displayed. 
This vehicle, driving on the left lane, receives order to enter 
the intersection in # 7, turning left (NE) and keeps moving 
in this direction across position #1 toward the North exit 
(Phase2, violet pose). In the right side, the received channels 
are identified by its 4-digit binary codes and associated

(end of Phase 2), they receive authorization. Then, Phase 3 
begins with vehicle b1 heading to the intersection (W) (pose 
red) while vehicles ai (1<i<5) follows its destination 
towards E (pose green).

 Traffic Signal Phasing  
The traffic controller uses queue, request and response 
messages, from the ai, bi, ci, ei and fi vehicles, fusing the 
self-localizations qi (t) with theirs space relative poses qij (t) 
(dotted lines in Figure 7) to generate phase durations 
appropriate to accommodate the demand on each cycle.

Figure 10 Requested phasing of traffic flows 
Vehicle x is assigned a unique time to enter the 
intersection, t[x]. According to the phasing diagram (Figure 
6), in Figure 10, the phasing flow for the intersection is 
visualized. From the capacity point of view it is more 
efficient, if Vehicle c1 is given access before Vehicles bi, 
and Vehicle c2 is given access before Vehicle e, forming a 
west left turn of set of vehicles (platoon) before giving way 
to the fourth phase (north and south conflicting flows), as 
stated in Figure 8. The speed of Vehicle e was reduced, 
keeping a safe distance between Vehicle e and Vehicle d.

 CONCLUSIONS 
Using V-VLC-ready connected cars, we propose a 
queue/request/response approach for managing four-legged 
intersections. A communication scenario is stablished and a 
“mesh/cellular” hybrid network configuration proposed. As 
a PoC, a phasing of traffic flows is suggested. In this study, 
the vehicles' arrival is controlled and they are scheduled to 
cross intersections at predetermined times to minimize 
traffic delays. V2I2V communication provides real-time 
data on queues, requests, and messages distances, including 
queue, request, and message travel times that influence 
traffic channeling in various routes. Delays between left-
turns and forward movements are also allocated taking into 
account 
the 
pose 
analysis. 
Based 
on 
the 
simulated/experimental 
results, 
the 
proposed 
VLC 
cooperative architecture appears to be appropriate for the 
intended applications. The introduction of VLC between 
connected vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure 
allows the direct monitoring of critical points that are related 
to the queue formation and dissipation, relative speed 
thresholds and inter-vehicle spacing increasing the safety.
