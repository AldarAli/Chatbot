Abstract— An empirical study of the power consumption of 
commercial IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee motes is presented. The 
analysis investigates the current that is drained by an 802.15.4 
based module when the radio channel is occupied or packet losses 
take place. For this purpose, we developed a simple testbed where 
problems in the radio medium are emulated in a controlled way. 
This is accomplished by artificially introducing in the protocol 
stack of the nodes a probability that a Clear Channel Assessment 
(CCA) failure or a packet collisions occurs. The results 
demonstrate the importance of CCA failures and especially 
packet collisions in determining the consumption of Wireless 
Sensor Networks with a moderate or high traffic load. Thus, 
problems related to the occupation of radio channel can easily 
more than halve the battery lifetime in networks with just some 
tens of nodes where data must be updated several times per 
second.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
IEEE 802.15.4 is a leading standard in the ambit of wireless 
sensor networks (WSNs). IEEE 802.15.4 [1] specifications 
define the physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers 
for networking architectures of low-cost, low-bandwidth, short-
range wireless nodes. IEEE 802.15.4 protocols offer the basis 
for WSN and Personal Area Network (PAN) standards, mainly 
ZigBee [2] but also ISA100.11a, WirelessHART or MiWi. The 
802.15.4 chipset market is growing dramatically. In 2010, 
ZigBee/802.15.4 chipset shipments nearly doubled while the 
annual revenues for ZigBee/802.15.4 modules are expected to 
reach $1.7 billion in 2015 [3]. Applications for smart homes 
are the main target of these modules, but other fields (such as 
smart cities, industrial plant-process, medical monitoring or 
wellness) are gaining attention from vendors and developers. 
IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee compliant nodes (or ‘motes’),  
which may operate in the ISM 868 MHz, 915 MHz or 2.4 GHz 
frequency bands, are designed to minimize the power 
consumption. They are normally battery powered and used in 
applications where battery replacement is generally unfeasible 
or too costly. 
Aiming at predicting the battery lifetime in a real 
application of 802.15.4/ZigBee technology, the current drain in 
the motes must be thoroughly evaluated. In most cases, 
wireless communications are the main source of battery usage. 
IEEE 802.15.4 MAC is conceived to switch off the transceiver 
when no packet has to be transmitted or received. As a result, 
the nodes may remain in a power-saving (sleep) mode most of 
the time, so that the batteries can be operative for years 
However, due to the contention method applied by 802.15.4 to 
access the medium (CSMA/CA), the consumption of the radio 
transceiver is strongly related to the status of the radio channel. 
Thus, if the medium is not found to be idle or a packet collision 
occurs (because two nodes transmit simultaneously), the 
protocol may induce a non-negligible increase of power 
consumption. In this article, we empirically analyze the impact 
of both the channel occupation and the packet collision on the 
battery drained by commercial 802.15.4/ZigBee nodes. The 
paper extends an initial study already published in [4] where 
the collisions were not taken into consideration. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes 
the behavior of 802.15.4 MAC as well as the dynamics of 
CSMA/CA algorithm. Section 3 briefly comments some 
related literature on 802.15.4/ZigBee consumption. Section 4 
details the utilized experimental testbed, while Section 5 shows 
and discusses the performed measurements. Finally, Section 6 
draws the main conclusions of the paper. 
II. 
IEEE 802.15.4 MAC 
According to IEEE 802.15.4 specification there are two 
types of network devices. Full-Function Devices (FFD) may 
perform as the ‘coordinator’ or central node of a star topology 
or otherwise interact on a peer-to-peer basis forming a multi-
hop mesh network. On the other hand, Reduced-Function 
Devices (RFDs), which are normally battery powered devices 
with limited capabilities, can only communicate with its 
coordinator (residing in a specific FFD).  
Additionally, IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer defines two 
possible operational modes:  
(1) Under the beacon enabled mode, the coordinator node 
periodically broadcasts a special frame (a beacon) informing 
about the existence of the network and allowing the 
synchronization of the ‘children’ nodes. Children nodes must 
wake-up just in time to receive the beacon from their 
Coordinator and keep synchronized to the network. After every 
beacon and during a special period called superframe, packet 
exchanges between the coordinator and the devices take place. 
When the superframe is finished, all the nodes (including the 
Coordinator) can enter into the sleep mode. Thus, battery 
consumption can be also reduced in the Coordinators (which 
can also act as intermediate router in a multi-hop 
802.15.4/ZigBee cluster-tree). This can be an important issue if 
Coordinators are also powered by batteries. However, long 
Beacon Intervals and extended sleep periods (apart from 
increasing packet delay) may provoke serious problems to keep 
the nodes synchronized because of clock inaccuracies. In fact, 
most commercial 802.15.4/ZigBee motes do not support 
beacon mode presently, most probably due to the difficulty to 
enable an efficient beacon tracking in the end devices. 
(2) Under the non beacon or point-to-point mode, 
coordinators do not send beacons. As no synchronization

exists, end devices can wake up (from its sleep mode) in any 
moment to send a data packet to the coordinator. In the 
opposite sense, if the coordinator wishes to send a data packet 
to an end device, it has to wait to be polled by the end device 
with a specific poll frame requesting the data.  
Non-beacon mode is more appropriate for networking 
applications which can be implemented by a simple star 
topology consisting in a set of wireless sensors/actuators and a 
Coordinator powered from the main source. In these scenarios 
(which correspond to many practical cases of WSN 
applications), the Coordinator can maintain its radio receiver 
active all the time so it can communicate with any device in 
any moment. The permanent activity of the Coordinator allows 
clients to be in a power saving mode for long intervals of time. 
Thus, the devices can wake up at their will (on a periodic or 
event-driven basis) just to transmit the sensed data or to poll 
the Coordinator to check if there is any pending message. 
A. CSMA/CA Algorithm 
In both the beacon or point-to-point mode, the access is 
regulated 
by 
CSMA/CA 
(Carrier 
Sense 
Multiple 
Access/Collision Avoidance). This medium access protocol 
obliges nodes to sense the radio medium before sending a data 
packet. So, according to IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, nodes willing to 
transmit data have to contend for the radio channel following 
the CSMA/CA protocol. Thus a source node must initially 
delay its transmission a random number of slots or backoff 
periods of 20 symbols (0.32 ms when the standard works in the 
2.4 GHz band with 62.5 Ksymbols/s). This number is selected 
in the range [0, 2BE-1], where BE is the backoff exponent, a 
variable that regulates the CSMA waiting process. After this 
inactive time, the node performs a Clear Channel Assessment 
(CCA) to test the availability of the radio channel. If the 
channel is not detected to be free, the BE exponent is increased 
in one unit (up to a maximum) and the procedure is reiterated. 
If the CCA operation consecutively fails a predetermined 
number of times, a channel access failure is assumed and the 
packet is discarded. On the contrary, if any CCA is successful, 
the radio transceiver of the node switches from the reception 
mode to the transmission mode (as 802.15.4 communications 
are half-duplex) and the data frame is emitted.  
Normally, the packet is only considered to be adequately 
transmitted if a specific acknowledgment packet (ACK) is 
received from the target node within a certain time interval. 
This ACK response is emitted by the destination upon the 
reception of the data packet as long as CSMA/CA algorithm 
does not apply for ACK packets. However, both the data 
packet or the ACK itself may not arrive properly because of a 
transmission error or a packet collision. Collisions can be 
produced by the activity of other 802.15.4 nodes or by 
interfering devices performing in the same 2.4 GHz band. 
When the acknowledgment is not received, the source node 
iterates the whole CSMA/CA process (resetting BE to its initial 
value). The number of times that the transmission can be 
repeated is also bounded by the specification. Thus, when the 
transmitter reaches this maximum, without any acknowledging, 
the MAC layer presumes a sending failure and the packet 
transmission is cancelled. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
Initial empirical works on the consumption of sensors in 
WSNs were devoted to devices which utilize proprietary stacks 
or just the physical layer of 802.15.4 (see, for example, the 
study in [5] about the CC1000 radio module of Mica2 motes by 
Crossbow [6]). However, many recent theoretical, simulation-
based and, in less proportion, laboratory studies have focused 
on 
modeling 
and 
characterizing 
the 
performance 
of 
802.15.4/ZigBee WSNs. 
The experimental testbeds presented in [9] [10] analyzed 
the coexistence of 802.15.4 with other wireless technologies 
(802.11 and/or Bluetooth) operating in the same 2.4 GHz ISM 
band. Results suggested that 802.15.4 throughput may be 
seriously affected by such interferences. In [11] authors 
compared non-beacon and beacon transmission modes in a 
realistic scenario with two IEEE 802.15.4 development boards 
through different performance metrics. The study in [12] 
briefly summarizes the current consumption of commercial 
chipsets of diverse standards for wireless communications, 
including Bluetooth, Ultrawideband (UWB), 802.11 (Wi-Fi) 
and 802.15.4/ZigBee technologies, during packet transmission 
and reception.  
The performance of CSMA/CA algorithm in 802.15.4 
networks, has been analytically modeled in many articles such 
as [13][14][15][16][17] for both beacon-enabled and/or 
beaconless topologies. The correctness of these models is 
assessed by simulations. On the other hand, the datasheets of 
802.15.4 radio modules normally describe the current 
consumption of the motes for the different basic states of the 
transceiver (idle, sleep, transmitting or receiving modes). Thus 
most battery models in the literature are merely based on the 
data offered by the vendors, without providing any validation 
with actual motes. 
In [18], the proposed model for slotted (beaconed) 802.15.4 
MAC is employed to predict the energy consumption per 
received data bit. However, the utilized consumption model for 
the different states of the nodes is not justified. A similar study, 
also focused on beacon enabled cluster-trees, is presented in 
[19]. The study offers a mathematical formulation to compute 
the consumption of the ZigBee Coordinator and the end 
devices of the cluster-tree depending on the emitted traffic and 
the beacon timing. For the calculus of the power consumption 
the model (which assumes that the radio state is idle during the 
CSMA/CA backoff time) utilizes the values offered by the 
datasheets of Chipcon (now acquired by Texas Instruments) 
CC2420 radio transceiver and the Microchip PIC18LF8720 
low-power microcontroller.  
The 
consumption 
in 
beaconed 
networks 
is 
also 
characterized in [20]. In that interesting paper authors present 
their own measurements of the power consumption of a 
CC2420 transceiver (although the experimental testbed for the 
measurements is not described). The paper also empirically 
characterizes the relationship between the received power and 
the bit error probability. As a result, the proposed model, which 
takes into account the dynamics of CSMA/CA mechanism, 
permits to calculate the mean required energy per data bit as a 
function of the path losses.

The consumption of IRIS sensors, which employ an 
ATMEL AT86RF230 transceiver, is studied in [21]. The 
performed tests allow characterizing the current drained during 
the basic operations of the motes (association, binding and data 
transmission). The deployed testbed does not isolate the motes 
and does not either consider the effect of the activity in the 
radio medium on the consumption. The study in [22] develops 
a simple linear model to estimate the upper lifetime bound of a 
WSN. The model is based on measurements of the energy 
consumption and execution time of different operations on a 
Tmote Sky sensor mote (which is provided with a CC2420 
radio module). As the study is intended to predict the longest 
possible sensor lifetime, neither the measurements nor the 
model contemplate the extra energy due to failed attempts to 
access the channel or lost messages provoked by collisions. 
The work in [23] assesses the applicability of beaconed 
802.15.4/ZigBee to industrial plant control applications. The 
evaluation is carried out through OMNeT++ simulations. The 
mean energy consumption per transmitted byte is estimated by 
assuming the battery model of a CC1000 radio module, which 
is not compliant with 802.15.4 standard.  
The feasibility of using 802.15.4 specifications for medical 
Personal Area Networks is analyzed in works such as 
[24][25][26]. In particular [24] presents an analytical model to 
compute the lifetime of a hypothetic network of implanted 
802.15.4 sensors. The study, which utilizes the typical 
consumption of a CC2420 chip, is carried out for both beacon 
and beaconless modes concluding that beaconed networks 
present more restrictions in term of available data rate and 
crystal 
tolerance. 
The 
applicability 
of 
802.15.4 
communications in medical WSNs is investigated in [25] and 
[26] through systematic simulations with OPNET and 
OMNeT++ tools. Aiming at calculating the energy consumed 
per message, authors in [26] utilize the model documented in 
the datasheets of Jennic JN5139 ZigBee modules. 
The study in [27] analyses the reliability of 802.15.4 
cluster-trees when three different sets of values are employed 
to define the parameterization of CSMA/CA algorithm. The 
same authors propose in [28] a cross-layer technique to tune 
the 802.15.4 MAC parameters. According to this technique, 
which is evaluated through ns-2 simulations of both single-hop 
and multihop WSN, the MAC parameters are adaptively 
defined to minimize battery usage. By means of simulations 
with Castalia 3.0 simulator, the article in [29] evaluates the 
energy consumption of sensor nodes in a multi-hop beacon-
enabled WSN when using physical and logical channel quality 
estimators. All these three studies also employ the battery 
consumption model of a Texas Instruments CC2420 radio 
transceiver. In [30], CSMA/CA parameterization is studied in a 
real testbed with Jennic JN5139 modules. Authors measure a 
message loss rate in the range [0-5%] although the conditions 
in which these losses are induced are not under control. 
Furthermore the goal of the measurements is to evaluate the 
delivery ratio of the 802.15.4 motes, so power consumption is 
not considered. 
IV. 
EMPLOYED TESTBED 
The employed testbed network consisted of a simple 
802.15.4 star topology. The star comprises a Coordinator node 
(acting as the network sink) and a (leaf) end-device, which 
performs as the sensor mote. The network was put into 
operation with two MSP4302618 Experimenter Boards [31] by 
Texas Instrument (TI), one of the most widespread vendors of 
802.15.4/ZigBee technology. These boards incorporate a last 
generation MSP430 microcontroller and can be extended with 
different TI low-power RF wireless modules. For our 
experiments, the boards were connected to an 802.15.4-
compatible CC2520EMK [32] transceiver working in the 2.4 
GHz ISM band. The nodes were powered by two AAA 1.5V 
batteries.  
In contrast with previous and other existing 802.15.4 
transceivers, CC2520EMK enters into a sleep mode during 
most part of the random CSMA wait periods. Consequently, 
the consumption of these idle CSMA waiting times (which we 
measured in our previous work [4]) has been practically 
removed. This fact is coherent with the analytical models of 
battery consumption existing in the literature related to 
802.15.4 technology, which almost unanimously assume that 
transceiver is turned off during the CSMA waits. Anyhow, 
CCA failures increase the number of CCA operations, so it 
may still impact on the current consumption. 
In our experiments, we measured the current drained from 
the batteries by the whole board. To isolate the effects of radio 
communications on battery utilization, all the peripherals 
included in the board (e.g. LED diodes) were carefully turned 
off for the measurements. Similarly, non utilized GPIO 
(General Purpose Input Output) pins were set as outputs to 
minimize the consumption of not-connected inputs.  
As the majority of commercial 802.15.4 radio transceivers, 
the CC2520EMK module works in the 2.4 GHz band. This 
chip implements the physical layer of IEEE 802.15.4 as well as 
some functionalities (such as CCA operation, frame filtering or 
automatic ACK generation) corresponding to the IEEE 
802.15.4 MAC layer. The CC24XX & CC25XX families of 
IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceivers are conceived to be 
utilized 
together 
with 
Z-Stack, 
the 
version 
of 
the 
802.15.4/ZigBee stack designed by TI. In the boards of our 
testbed, Z-stack is loaded and run by the MSP430 
microcontroller. 
To emulate CCA failures and packet losses, the C source 
code of Z-stack was intentionally modified and recompiled 
before being installed in the microcontroller of the sensor mote. 
In particular we altered the procedure that executes the CCA 
for unslotted CSMA transmissions in the transceiver as well as 
the function that informs the sending node about the reception 
of ACK messages. So, the CSMA wait is performed (or not) 
depending on a constant probability and not on the actual state 
of the medium (which will be always free because wired 
transmissions are employed). Thus, this parameter, which is 
defined by the user for every experiment, decides the 
probability of assuming that the channel is busy and, 
consequently, the existence of a CCA failure. Similarly, packet 
retransmission is uniquely based on another user-defined 
probability, which determines the possibility of not detecting 
the reception of the ACK packets (which is basically 
equivalent to a packet collision). In the code, for every CCA 
operation and every packet transmission, a pseudo-random 
211

integer between 0 and (216-1) is generated. This number is 
normalized to 1 and compared with the existing CCA failure 
(or packet collision) probability to decide if a failure (or a 
collision) must take place. 
The utilized testbed for the consumption characterization is 
depicted in Figure 1. The goal is to measure the current 
required by a generic sensing node (performing as an 802.15.4 
end device) when it regularly sends data to a sink node (with 
the role of the Coordinator). This upstream traffic closely 
approximates the typical application of a Wireless Sensor 
Network. 
As radio modules incorporate an SMA antenna connector, 
the communication between the motes is achieved through a 
0.5 m long SMA-to-SMA cable. Thus, the interferences of any 
other device operating in the same unlicensed band (e.g. 
through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections) are avoided. The 
transmission power of the transceiver is chosen to be 0 dBm (1 
mW) while the attenuation provoked by the cable and each 
SMA connector is under 0.1 dB/m and 1 dB respectively. 
Consequently, the power at the receptor is about -2 dBm, 
which is far from the limits imposed by the saturation of the 
radio receptor (6 dBm) and by the transceiver sensitivity (-98 
dBm). This guarantees that any detected CCA failure or packet 
collision is caused by the failure and collision probabilities 
introduced in the ZigBee stack of the end device. 
To estimate the mean current required by the sensor mote 
for the different considered scenarios, we utilized a true-rms 
Fluke 289 digital multimeter. For the range of 50 mA, this 
piece of equipment measures the DC current with an accuracy 
of 0.05% and a resolution of 1 µA. The multimeter is 
connected between the voltage source (of 3 V) and the supply 
pin of the experimental board (as it is reflected in Fig.1). In this 
board, 
the 
consumption 
of 
the 
transceiver 
or 
the 
microcontroller cannot be easily segregated from that of the 
rest of the board. Therefore the measurements compute the 
current drained by the whole board. After minimizing the 
effects of the peripherals, this consumption is essentially 
caused by the aggregated activity of the microcontroller and the 
radio transceivers.  
The applications loaded in the motes were part of a control 
application provided with the demonstration kit. In the 
application, the end device, acting as a switch (e.g. a lamp 
switch), may send a simple command to the coordinator (which 
could be located in a bulb). In our experiments this command 
are programmed to be transmitted at regular intervals with a 
programmable periodicity. Each command is conveyed in a 
single 802.15.4/ZigBee packet with a MAC data payload of 25 
bytes (9 bytes of application data plus the 16 byte overhead 
introduced by the ZigBee Network Layer and the ZigBee 
Application Support Sub-Layer). This scenario can represent 
the typical case of a ZigBee WSN where sensors periodically 
transmit a simple parameter which can be codified in some 
bytes, within the payload of a small packet.  
V. 
OBTAINED RESULTS  
We executed a series of systematic experiments using the 
previous testbed and modifying the probabilities of a CCA 
failure and packet collision. In all the experiments, the 
algorithms involved in the CSMA/CA access method were 
parameterized with default values defined by the 802.15.4 
specification. (e.g. the minimum and maximum value for the 
Backoff exponent). 
Packet rate was fixed to 5 data packets per second. In 
addition, the end device (in a typical ZigBee application) is 
programmed to poll the Coordinator in a periodic basis to 
request possible data. In our experiments, this poll process was 
programmed to be executed just one time every 5 seconds. 
Similarly, after sending any packet, end devices normally 
transmit a poll packet to the Coordinator to enable a response 
to the sent data. In our case, the time between the data packet 
and its corresponding poll packet was also set to a maximum of 
5 seconds (thus, only one poll frame of this type is transmitted 
for every 25 packets). As a consequence, poll packets have a 
minor impact on battery consumption, which is mainly due to 
the data packets. 
Different transmission scenarios were considered by 
varying the probabilities of experiencing a CCA failure or a 
packet collision.

Authors in [16] analytically compute both the CCA failure 
probability and the packet collision in a beaconless 802.15.4 
network. Their analysis assume that motes only employ carrier 
sensing techniques so that only the activity of other 802.15.4 
nodes in the network can cause CCA failures. This implies that 
external interferences (by devices of other technologies 
working in the same band) and other channel errors are not 
considered to compute the CCA failure or packet collision 
probabilities. Even neglecting the effects of the interferences, 
author show that for data rates of 5 packets per second and per 
node, networks of 10 to 100 nodes may suffer probabilities of 
CCA failure and packet collisions in the range [0.1-0.9]. These 
probabilities clearly drop only if the nodes present a lower 
activity. Therefore, even in networks with a not very high 
number of nodes, a high rate of CCA failures and packet 
collisions must be expected if the motes update and transmit 
their sensed data frequently. Interferences just can deteriorate 
this behavior. 
Taking into account this realistic data, we performed 
different experiments by modifying the probabilities of CCA 
failure and packet collisions from 0.0 (ideal case where the 
channel is always available and no loss occurs) to 1.0 (worst 
case where channel is always busy and all packets are lost), 
with constant increments of 0.1.  
The measured mean current drained by the end device is 
depicted in Figure 2. We repeated the experiments for three 
limit cases: a) CCA operations may fail but no collision takes 
place; b) only packet collisions can occur (CCA always 
successes); c) CCA operation and collisions happen with the 
same probability. The two first cases allow isolating the effect 
of each process whereas the third case corresponds to the most 
realistic situation where collisions and CCA fails are strongly 
correlated.   
Each displayed point in the figure represents the 
measurement of the mean drain current after the transmission 
of 9000 packets (about 30 minutes) under a constant 
probability of CCA failure and/or packet collision. 
With collision probabilities higher than 0.8, the losses cause 
the sensor to disassociate from the coordinator very often. This 
resulted in an extremely high consumption (25.662 mA) as the 
end device is trying to re-associate to the Coordinator almost 
permanently. 
The graphs show that CCA failures increase the power 
consumption. In particular, the extra consumption due to the 
repetition of the CCA operation ranges from 10% to 50%. The 
rise rate in the battery usage is accelerated for higher values of 
the probability of a CCA failure. This can be explained by the 
fact that the utilized version of ZigBee stack tries to retransmit 
the data packet once again whenever a channel access failure 
occurs (after 5 consecutive CCA failures). Thus, the increase 
does not follow a linear function. 
On the other hand, packet collision is shown to have a 
higher impact on the battery usage. As long as the packet has to 
be retransmitted for every loss, the consumption rapidly grows 
with the collision probability. Figure also illustrates that the 
combination of both effects (collisions and CCA failures) 
strongly degrades the lifetime of the battery. So, for this more 
realistic situation, the drain current rockets for collision (and 
CCA failure) probabilities higher than 0.4. This fact should be 
carefully taken into account when designing a WSN where 
sensors are expected to have a short duty-cycle. In that 
scenario, collisions and channel access failures could easily 
reduce the battery lifetime (in a network with some tens of 
nodes) by a factor of 3 or 4 with respect to the ideal case with a 
free radio medium. Moreover, the employed uncorrelated 
model which decides the timing of CCA failures or packet 
losses can also be considered too optimistic. In fact, the periods 
of channel occupation or the activity of interferences normally 
follow correlated patterns which are better characterized by 
Markov processes. The existence of long periods of channel 
occupancy or other radio channel problems should even 
decrease the node lifetime in a real WSN application.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has empirically studied the impact of CCA 
failures and packet collisions on the current consumption of an 
actual 802.15.4/ZigBee mote.  
While other practical studies in the literature introduce 
CCA failures or packet losses in the 802.15.4 communications 
by adding wireless interfering sources, our study has 
implemented a simple testbed of two actual nodes where 
channel occupation and packet collisions are emulated via 
software by altering the protocol stack of the motes. Thus, the 
utilized testbed has permitted to carry out a set of systematic 
and repeatable measurements of the battery consumption for 
diverse preset values of the channel occupation and packet 
collision probabilities (which is not possible in a scenario 
where radio communication problems are induced by a 
background wireless traffic.) 
Achieved results indicate that the combination of CCA 
failures and packet collisions may produce a severe drop in the 
battery lifetime of the nodes. 
The paper has presented the preliminary results of an 
ongoing investigation. Future work should investigate the 
effects of other factors, considering a more complex stochastic
