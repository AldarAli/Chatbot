Abstract— While existing voice navigation systems provide 
simple and easy-to-understand directions, they have a 
disadvantage in that voice directions tend to be long when the 
number of left-right turns is large. The objective of this study is 
to realize a summarization method for voice directions that also 
provides a geographic image of the route to the destination. The 
system generates multiple candidate routes and simplifies the 
voice directions based on street names. Furthermore, we 
propose a method to evaluate multiple candidate routes and 
determine the optimal route using evaluation formulas that 
indicate the degree of summarization of both the route and text 
of directions. Experimental results showed that the proposed 
method yielded a higher route recall agreement rate in 
participants. Although the optimization method was effective, 
the evaluation formulas did not work well for some paths.

I. INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, voice navigation systems, such as Google 
Maps, have become increasingly popular. Many of existing 
voice navigation systems employ a turn-by-turn style 
directions method [1], in which 1) a route is determined 
primarily based on a shortest path algorithm [2], and 2) the 
distance and direction to the next intersection are repeated by 
a voice; this enables guidance to a specified destination. 
While this has the advantage of simple and easy-to-
understand guidance, it has the disadvantage of a long voice 
navigation text if the number of left-right turns is large. It is 
better to keep voice directions as short and clear as possible, 
especially when considering the use of voice directions on 
fixed digital signage, which has become increasingly popular 
in recent years. For example, the Mei-chan [3] and Shaberu 
Bus Stop [4] signage-type voice navigation systems, installed 
at the main gate of our university, allow users to receive voice 
directions while viewing a route to the required destination 
on a map on a screen. In other words, when a user prefers a 
geographical image of a route, detailed voice directions are 
not necessary, but summarized, short, and easy-to-understand 
voice directions should be generated. 
The objective of this study is to realize a summary of 
spoken directions that also provides a geographic image of 
the route to the destination. In order to achieve the above 
objectives, we previously proposed a method [5] that 1) 
generate an easy-to-understand route that is not necessarily 
the shortest route, but is suitable for summarization, and 2) 
summarize the route so that the voice direction fits within the 
specified number of characters. 
In this study, we adopt the following three approaches: 1) 
generate multiple candidate routes with fewer right/left turns 
than the shortest route using the n-Min Stroke Shortest Path 
(n-MSSP) algorithm; 2) simplify the routes based on street 
names, considering street names to be key points for 
generating voice directions; and 3) based on evaluation 
formulas that indicate the degree of summarization of the 
route, the best route is determined. We believe that 
summarizing voice directions will contribute to improved 
pedestrian navigation and more advanced digital signage-
based systems.  
In this paper, we describe related studies in Section 2, 
describe the proposed system in Section 3, discuss the 
evaluation of the proposed system in Section 4, and 
summarize in Section 5. 
II.  RELATED WORK 
Although there have been many studies on summarizing 
natural language sentences and on road generalizations [6-8], 
few studies have focused on summarizing voice directions. 
A road generalization is a method that draws only the 
major roads in a road network based on the length of road 
strokes. A stroke is a grouping of road networks based on 
cognitive psychology [6] [7], and represents a following path. 
Zhang et al. [8] realized road generalization by selecting 
distinctive roads based on their connective relationships. 
Within studies into the applications of road generalizations, 
methods based on facility search results [9] [10] and in a 
Fisheye-view format [11] have been proposed. However, 
road generalization only selects roads based on their 
geometry and connectivity, and does not consider the 
implications on voice directions.  
There are also several studies on summarization in the 
Geographic Information System (GIS) field; Kaigun et al. 
[12] proposed social data and sentence summarization 
methods for travel route recommendations. Other existing

methods include summarizing the structure of a road network 
in an easy-to-read manner [13], generating customized 
cognitive turn-by-turn directions based on a user's travel 
history [14], and summarizing and generating meaningful 
sentences from travel data [15]. 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM 
The configuration of the proposed system is outlined in 
Figure 1. First, given a departure point and an arrival point, a 
set of the n (n=1,2,...) MSSP routes is computed based on the 
n-min stroke shortest path (n-MSSP) function; these are 
considered as candidate routes. Then, the candidate routes are 
simplified based on a street-based path simplifier function. If 
the simplification of the candidate paths is not sufficient, a 
Vertex based path simplifier function, based on the number 
of vertices, is used to further simplify them. Next, the text for 
the simplified candidate routes’ navigation is summarized 
using on a word count-based text summarization function. 
Finally, the optimization of voice directions is achieved using 
the optimal path determination function based on evaluation 
formulas. This generates a summarized route and the 
corresponding guidance text. The MMDAgent [16] and 
MMDAgent EDIT [17] mechanisms were used to generate 
the voice directions.

A. 
n-Min Stroke Shortest Path Function 
The n-MSSP search method [18] searches for multiple 
candidate routes between two points based on given rules, 
which will be outlined later. The n-MSSP function can obtain 
the shortest route from the routes that require fewer right or 
left turns than the shortest route. 
Specifically, a road set, stroke set, etc., are obtained from 
the road database, and the algorithm proposed by Hiura et al. 
[18] is used to search for and obtain a set of the n-MSSP 
routes. The definition of the n-MSSP is as follows.  
● 
1-MSSP 
The shortest path among the paths with the fewest number 
of left or right turns between two points. 
● 
n-MSSP 
The path with the smallest amount of left or right turns 
among the paths shorter than the [n-1]-MSSP route. 
B. Street-Based Path Simplifier Function 
The street-based path simplifier function simplifies routes 
by using major roads with street names as key points. In other 
words, even if there are multiple routes to a major road, the 
system greatly simplifies route guidance based on the 
hypothesis that any route can reach the major road if it has a 
general direction. 
The simplification algorithm is shown in Figure 2. First, 
for every route obtained by the n-MSSP search function, data 
on the behavior of the current node is stored when 
progressing to the next node. Next, for each path, the 
existence of a street name for the next link connected to the 
current node is checked sequentially in the direction from the 
end point to the beginning point. If a street name exists, the 
loop terminates. If there is no street name, the search 
continues until the next node of the starting point is reached.

C. Word-Based Text Summarization Function 
A word-based text summarization function generates an 
optimal guide text within the specified number of characters. 
The five key components of a guide text are "minimum 
information", "time required", "total distance", "distance", 
and "turning point". "Minimum information" refers to the 
information expressed only in terms of the direction of the 
turn, and the other four components are considered to be 
supplementary information to make the directions easier to 
understand.  
Taking the initial value of each component of the guide 
consisting of only the "minimum information," we seek a 
combination that maximizes the sum of values under the 
condition that the word limit is satisfied. In other words, the 
problem of generating a guidebook is reduced to the 0-1 
knapsack problem, where "number of characters = weight". 
The value of each component of the guide text is determined 
based on a hierarchical analysis method [19], as shown in 
𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 : The i-th node 
𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 : Action at the i-th node 
for  (i ← 0 to n-1) { 
   𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖=  next action at the i-th node (go straight : -1, turn left : 
0, turn right : 1) 
Store ∞ at the start and end points (a_0,a_(n-1)) 
} 
for(i ← n-2 to 1) { 
   if(𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 ≠ −1) { 
      Check if there is a street name on the link in the 
direction to the end point connected to that node.  
      if (Street name ≠null) { 
         exit 
      } 
   } 
}

D. 
Vertex-Based Path Simplifier Function 
The vertex based path simplifier function uses the 
Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm [20] to simplify a path by 
reducing the number of vertices on the guided path one by 
one. The Visvalingam-Whatt algorithm is a method that 
geometrically simplifies Polyline. Although geometrical 
simplification omits some guidance, such as small turns, we 
considered it to be sufficient for the purpose of this study, i.e., 
to grasp the geographical image of the guided route. 
Specifically, the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm is 
applied iteratively until the number of vertices within the 
character limit of the audio guidance text generated by the 
"minimum information" is reached. For each decrease in the 
number of vertices, a guide sentence is generated, which is 
then judged regarding whether it satisfies the termination 
condition (i.e., the character count limit) or not. 
E. 
Optimal Path Determination Function 
In the optimal path determination function, all candidate 
routes are evaluated using the evaluation formulas to 
determine the optimal route and guide sentences. First, the 
function obtains the value Ai from the result of the street 
based path simplifier function, which indicates how well the 
route is expressed, i.e., how well it concisely captures the 
main points of the route. The definition of Ai is as follows: 
𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 =
𝑋𝑋
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 
where 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 is the number of components in the simplified 
guide for the i-th candidate route, and 𝑋𝑋 is the number of 
components in the pre-simplified candidate route directions 
with the greatest number of right or left turns.  
Next, we obtain the value Bi from the vertex-based path 
simplifier function, which is a measure of how much of the 
guide text is summarized in the parts that are not related to 
the main parts of the route. The definition of Bi is as follows: 
𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖 =
𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖
𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖, 
where 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 and 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 are the number of vertices of the i-th path 
before and after applying the vertex based path simplifier 
function, respectively. 
When determining the optimal route for a user, it is 
necessary to consider the balance between the number of left 
or right turns and the distance. Therefore, we define Ci and 
Di, which are standardized numbers for left/right turns and 
distances, respectively, as follows: 
𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖−𝑐𝑐
¯
𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 , 
where 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 is the inverse of the number of right/left turns, 𝑐𝑐
¯ is 
the mean of 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖, and 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 is the standard deviation of  𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖, and 
𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 =
𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖−𝑑𝑑
¯
𝜎𝜎𝑑𝑑 , 
where 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 is the inverse of the distance, 𝑑𝑑
¯
 is the mean of 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖, 
and 𝜎𝜎𝑑𝑑 is the standard deviation of 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖. 
 
Using these values, we evaluate each path using the 
following equation, called the evaluation formula (1): 
𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔(𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 + 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖), 
(1) 
where 𝜔𝜔 is a small value, 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖 represents how precisely 
and clearly the guidance text is expressed, and 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 + 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 
represents how well balanced the number of right and left 
turns and distances are. 
IV. EVALUATION 
The purpose of our experiment was to verify whether the 
proposed method of summarizing directions is more effective 
for users to remember routes and for expressing directions 
more clearly than the conventional method. 
A. 
Experimental Condition 
An evaluation experiment was conducted on 12 subjects. 
Generated directions and map images were presented to the 
subjects, and 1) the time taken to memorize the route (average 
measurement time) was recorded; 2) the accuracy of subject’ 
route recall (route matching rate) was analyzed; and 3) a 5-
step questionnaire survey was conducted. Table 1 shows the 
combinations based on the comparison experiments. 
Two types of paths (shortest paths and the ⌈n/2⌉-th n-
MSSP) and a combination of three path simplification 
methods (no summary, vertex based path simplifier, street 
based path simplifier) were evaluated. The ⌈n/2⌉th n-MSSP is 
the ⌈n/2⌉th path obtained by the n-MSSP  algorithm. Subjects 
performed evaluation experiments on different paths for each 
method. Methods 1-2, 1-3, 2-2, and 2-3 are the proposed 
methods. 
The character count limit was set to 40 characters, which 
was considered to be an appropriate length for the voice 
guidance text based on a preliminary survey. The 
questionnaire questions, presented on a 5-point scale, were as 
follows: 
1. 
Is the route easy to remember? 
2. 
Is the guidance easy to understand? 
3. 
Did the voice guidance help ease your anxiety 
about the road?

Experimental Result 
Figure 4 shows the results of the route matching rate. The 
route matching rate is the percentage of the actual route that 
matched the participant’s memorized route after they listened 
to the voice guidance text. The methods based on the ⌈n/2⌉th 
n-MSSP (2-1, 2-2, and 2-3) yielded higher route matching 
rates than the methods based on the shortest paths (1-1, 1-2, 
and 1-3). Since the method based on the ⌈n/2⌉th n-MSSP 
requires fewer left or right turns than the shortest path, this 
result suggests that the path with fewer left or right turns is 
easier for a user to remember.  
Table 2 compares the average time taken for a participant 
to memorize the route by looking at the voice guidance text 
and route map for each method. Users required less time to 
memorize the route for Methods 1-2 and 2-2 than for the other 
methods. This result indicates that the vertex-based path 
simplifier function is effective in reducing the time required 
to memorize a route. 
Finally, the results of the questionnaire are shown in 
Figure 5. For the question "Is the route easy to remember?",  
the summary generated from the vertex-based path simplifier 
function (Methods 1-2 and 2-2) obtained the highest 
evaluation for each route. The summary based on the street-
based path simplifier function (Method 2-3) did not achieve 
such a high value. This indicates that there is room for 
improvement of the street name-based route summarization 
algorithm. In response to the question "Is the guidance easy 
to understand?", Method 1-2 received a higher rating when 
the number of right or left turns was higher.

Evaluation of Optimization Methods Based on 
Evaluation Formulas 
Next, we evaluated the optimization function based on the 
evaluation formula (Eq.1). 12 subjects were interviewed 
about which of the routes between Destinations A and F 
generated by the following three methods they found easier 
to understand: 
Shortest path The route determined by the shortest 
path algorithm. 
n-MSSP path（proposed method） The route with 
the fewest number of right/left turns, determined by the 
n-MSSP algorithm. 
Optimal path (proposed method） Overall optimal 
path generated based on the evaluation equations.

path method.  Middle: n-MSSP method.  Right: optimal path method. 
 
 
 
Figure 8.   Interviews results regarding optimal routes. 
 
Examples of the paths used in the experiments are shown 
in Figures 6 and 7, and the experimental results are shown in 
Figure 8. The n-MSSP path and the optimization path yielded 
superior results compared with the baseline method, the 
shortest path. Theoretically, the global optimization method 
should exhibit the best results, but for some paths, the simpler 
minimum stroke path was superior. This result suggests that 
the evaluation formula does not work effectively for some 
paths, and that improvements can be made.  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed a method for summarizing 
voice directions. Using the n-MSSP (n-min stroke shortest 
path) algorithm, multiple candidate routes were generated 
that required progressively fewer right or left turns than the 
shortest path. We regarded the street names as a key point in 
generating voice guidance; hence, the routes were simplified 
based on the street names. Furthermore, the best route and its 
guide text are determined from multiple candidate routes 
using the evaluation formula for the degree of summarization 
of the route. 
Through evaluation experiments, a total of six 
combinations of two different routes and three different guide 
text generation methods were evaluated. The experimental 
results showed that the proposed method yielded a higher 
route recall agreement rate in participants. In particular, the 
combination of the ⌈n/2⌉th n-MSSP and the vertex based path 
simplifier function was effective. Although the optimization 
method was effective, the evaluation formulas did not work 
well for some paths. This suggests that the evaluation formula 
requires improvements. 
In the future, we plan to implement a new summarization 
method that better combines vertex- and street name-based 
summarizations, and to improve map rendering to highlight 
road names and other key points of the route.
