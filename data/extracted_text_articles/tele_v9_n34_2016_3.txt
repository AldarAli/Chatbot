Abstract— In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the secondary 
users may encounter frequent IP handoffs due to high 
spectrum mobility, even if they remain static spatially. Since 
mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is not originally designed to deal 
gracefully with such IP handoffs induced by spectrum mobility 
only, the performance of the IP-based applications running in 
secondary users (SUs) may degrade severely in such scenarios. 
This paper conducts a simulation based investigation to gauge 
the seriousness of the issue and then suggests possible 
solutions. To do so, we have first developed in ns-3 a CR 
Attribute Module, and then implemented MIPv6 over it. For 
SUs, we have considered three spectrum selection strategies, 
namely Greedy, Most Recently Used, and Least Frequently 
Used. In each case, we have analyzed how the frequency of IP 
handoffs varies with the rise in spectrum mobility, resulting in 
degraded throughput in SUs. Our study reveals that MIPv6 is 
unable to work properly in CR networks mainly due to the 
high default values of MIPv6 parameters. So, we propose to 
customize mobile IPv6 – in terms of appropriating the pre-set 
values of its parameters – in order to make it work properly in 
CR networks, especially where the spectrum mobility is high.

 INTRODUCTION 
The ever-increasing popularity of mobile devices and 
smart phones are causing explosive growth of data traffic in 
mobile communication networks [1]-[4]. At the same time, 
the licensed spectrum for mobile broadband is becoming 
limited and hence costly to the mobile operators. However, 
recent surveys on spectrum occupancy statistics in various 
countries worldwide reveal that licensed bands are not being 
utilized fully [3]. This opens up the possibility that a user of 
a heavily loaded system can harness the underutilized 
spectrum of another system opportunistically. The well-
known approach of dynamic spectrum access employs the 
cognitive radio (CR) technique, which has been standardized 
in IEEE 1900.4 [4] and included in the end-to-end efficiency 
project of the European Telecommunication Standard 
Institute (ETSI) [5]. According to IEEE 1900.4 [4] and ITU-
R M.2330-0 report [6], opportunistic spectrum usage could 
be another deployment scenario of CR-based dynamic 
spectrum access in heterogeneous CR networks (CRNs). In 
CRNs, the base stations/access points (BSs/APs) are 
assumed to be legacy, operating in a particular radio access 
technology 
(RAT), 
whereas 
mobile 
devices, 
called 
secondary users (SUs), are reconfigurable terminals (can use 
different frequency bands of radio access networks (RANs)). 
Utilization of idle licensed spectrum in this way reduces the 
capital expenditure as no extra investment is needed for new 
system installations.  
An SU in a CRN switches from one channel to another, 
when it is interrupted by a licensed device, commonly 
known as primary user (PU). This event of channel 
switching is called spectrum mobility [7]. Spectrum mobility 
in a multi-RAT, multi RAN and multi-operator environment 
causes two types of handoff: intra-system handoff and inter-
system handoff [4]. Switching from a busy channel to a free 
channel of the same network system at the time of PU arrival 
causes an intra-system handoff. On the contrary, switching 
from a busy channel of one network system to a free channel 
of a different network system at the time of PU arrival is 
called an inter-system handoff. Inter-system handoff happens 
typically in a heterogeneous radio environment, where 
multiple operators use multi-RATs in the same location (for 
example, Fig. 1). In Fig. 1, one operator has WCDMA 
commercial network (i.e., a cellular system), while another 
operator owns IEEE 802.11x technology as a private WLAN 
system. In such a muti-RAT, multi-operator scenario, inter-
system handoff is a major challenge because the 
conventional handoff management schemes (such as GPRS 
tunneling protocol used in 3G systems, or, the complex

tunneling mechanism, used in Long Term Evolution (LTE)) 
used to perform handoff between the same RAT within the 
same operator’s network. Hence, they can be solely based on 
link layer technology. As a result, these techniques are not 
suitable for heterogeneous CRNs.  
So, there is a strong need to migrate the technology-
specific core infrastructure toward all-IP platform, since IP is 
generic enough to serve all underlying technologies. 
Although there are numerous IP-based handoff management 
protocols, we consider mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [9] in this work 
because it is the de-facto standard in today’s world. As 
reported by ITU-R [6], the inter-system handoff can be 
handled through IP layer by implementing a dedicated radio 
system as the common signaling channel, called basic access 
network (BAN) [8]. It employs a cognitive pilot channel, 
standardized in the E3 project, to inform the SUs about the 
access information, such as the available channels, relevant 
load and access strategy of each RAT. Due to the dynamic 
behaviour of radio networks, BANs adopt a handoff strategy 
that uses the environmental radio information (i.e., channel 
idleness), useful for opportunistic SUs to switch to the 
preferred network. The cognitive pilot channel consumes 
small bandwidth of a licensed/unlicensed channel as reported 
in [6]. It is used for the sole purpose of signaling only, and 
not for data transmission.  
The focus of our work in this paper is on the performance 
evaluation of inter-system handoffs caused by spectrum 
mobility only [10]. We assume that the unavailability of 
channels in the current network causes an inter-system 
handoff that ultimately leads to an IP handoff. Thus, 
eventually, the frequency of IP handoffs depends on the 
parameters, such as PU arrival rate and PU channel holding 
time [11]. In CRNs, the number of such IP handoffs may be 
quite high even when the SU is stationary (i.e., mobility-
driven handoffs are practically zero). Moreover, in modern 
WLAN and LTE or LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) networks, the 
channel usage occurs in discontinuous mode, i.e., a PU uses 
a channel for its transmission for a short duration, and then 
immediately releases the channel for the other PUs [12]. For 
instance, on an average if a PU has 210 bytes of data to 
transmit and its transmission rate is 20 Kbps, its average 
channel holding time is 0.4 s (=(210*8)/20000). Also, 80% of 
the spectrum holes in a WLAN are not very big, being only 
0-3 s wide [13]. Given such small channel holding times as 
well as narrow spectrum holes, PU interruption frequency 
becomes very high. It renders the CRN environment 
extremely dynamic for the SUs. This, in turn, poses a new 
set of challenges for the MIPv6 [9] itself because even if the 
SUs are static, they have to invoke MIPv6 to handle IP 
handoffs triggered by spectrum mobility.

MIPv6 was originally designed for handling spatial 
mobility only, and so it is not optimized for frequent IP 
handoffs due to inter-system spectrum mobility. It is well 
known that the handoff procedure in MIPv6 takes a 
significant amount of time, approximately 1.896 s to 2.47 s 
[14]. Hence, the net temporal overhead due to multiple IP 
handoffs may become very high over the complete lifetime 
of a data connection for an SU, which degrades its data 
throughput significantly. That is why the objective of this 
paper is to investigate the performance of MIPv6 in CRNs, 
in particular, the effect of spectrum mobility on MIPv6. We 
know that, depending on the movement detection and care-
of-address (CoA) configuration strategies, the standard 
MIPv6 has three flavors: router advertisement (RA) based 
MIPv6 [9], router solicitation (RS) based MIPv6 [9] and 
dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) based MIPv6 
[9][15]. In the first two flavors, an SU uses a stateless 
address auto-configuration mechanism to configure new 
CoA. In the third flavor, the DHCP server assigns IP 
addresses through a dynamic address allocation method [15]. 
We have performed our analyses using all the three flavors 
of MIPv6. To simulate a heterogeneous CRN, we have 
developed the following modules in the network simulator 
ns-3 [16]: (1) a CR attribute module (CRAM) to mimic a 
typical CRN, (2) three basic spectrum selection algorithms, 
namely greedy (GDY), most recently used (MRU), and least 
frequently used (LFU), and (3) our own MIPv6 module [17] 
as per RFC 6275 [9]. 
Our main purpose is to identify exact causes behind the 
afore-mentioned issues of MIPv6 (in all the three flavors) 
when used in CRNs. We have investigated the simulation 
traces and observed that the high values of RA interval, 
lifetime of CoA, and duplicate address detection (DAD) 
timers are primarily responsible for the poor performance of 
MIPv6. Next, we have validated the numerical results with 
our simulation results. Finally, we have suggested the 
suitable values for CoA lifetime and DAD period for 
possible use in heterogeneous CRNs. Also, we have 
measured the throughput performance of SUs for different 
spectrum selection algorithms, by varying the PU arrival rate 
and PU channel holding time. It is worth mentioning here 
that this paper is an extended version of [1] to report 
additional numerical analyses, wide-ranging simulation 
results, new validation exercises, and explanatory notes.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, we discuss recent research works on spectrum handoff 
and IP handoff in CRNs. Section III provides a brief 
description of our model implementations in ns-3. Section IV 
illustrates the MIPv6 issues noted in the considered 
heterogeneous CRNs. In Section V, we have analyzed the 
number of IP handoffs and its impact on throughput of the 
SUs. Finally, Section VI recommends the suitable 
modifications needed to overcome the issues with MIPv6. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
To access the Internet services using CRNs, the SUs 
cycle through three sequential phases: spectrum handoff 
phase, IP handoff phase, and data transmission phase. The 
spectrum handoff phase consists of channel sensing, handoff 
decision, pause, and channel switching functions [7]. 
Similarly, IP handoff phase consists of RA, CoA formation, 
and tunnel setup [9]. The phase transition is illustrated in Fig. 
2. During data transmission, if reappearance of PU occurs, 
then the SU moves again to channel sensing phase, where the 
SU attempts to find spectrum holes to switch to. If an empty 
channel is unavailable, the SU continues sensing the set of 
busy channels, repeating channel sensing and pause phases 
continuously. In the spectrum decision phase, the SU decides 
the best channel to switch to, among the available channels. 
The selection logic is closely related to the channel 
characteristics, and the operations of the PUs and the SUs. In 
the channel switch phase, the SU changes its operating 
channel. If the channel switch occurs in the same system, 
data transmission resumes immediately; otherwise, the SU 
encounters an additional IP handoff. 
Though many recent research works focus on spectrum 
mobility in CRNs, only a few of those focus on the resulting 
IP handoffs and problems thereof faced by SUs. Some of the 
previous works try to reduce MIPv6 handoff delay in 
heterogeneous CRNs, through integrated system architecture 
[10] and using a cross-layer protocol [11]. 
A. Spectrum Handoff 
Wang et al. [18][19] have proposed a dynamic 
programming based greedy algorithm to determine the 
optimal target channel sequence, and proved that the greedy 
algorithm provides the same results as the dynamic 
programming based algorithm, but with lower time 
complexity. To optimize the data delivery time, a traffic-
adaptive spectrum handoff mechanism is proposed in [19]. It 
changes the target channel sequence of spectrum handoffs 
based on traffic conditions. Southwell et al. [20] analyzed 
spectrum handoff delay, considering the cost of channel 
switching and congestion due to multiple SUs, with prior 
knowledge of heterogeneous channels. They have proposed a 
fast algorithm to determine the best single-user decision,

depending on other user’s plans without communicating with 
each other. 
B. IP Handoff 
In [10], Kataoka et al. have proposed an MIP-based CRN 
architecture to reduce the handoff delay. The system 
architecture contains a control node that integrates multi-
RAT 
access 
points 
and 
a 
unified 
authentication, 
authorization and accounting (AAA) server that performs 
authentication, authorization and charging on behalf of all 
networks. The AAA server provides a single IP address to 
SUs while roaming among multiple networks and a control 
node manages the IP handoff through a fast routing based 
scheme. However, the downside of this protocol is that the 
control node becomes a bottleneck and this may result in a 
single point failure. Chen et al. [11] have proposed a cross-
layer protocol to optimize the data transmission time in CR 
LTE 
networks. 
Since 
the 
authors 
have 
assumed 
homogeneous LTE networks, they have not used MIPv6. 
Instead they have used the standard LTE handoff mechanism 
which takes only a few ms; so there is not much impact of IP 
handoff on transmission time. 
The above existing proposals have been made to reduce 
the IP handoff latency in CRNs. They are unable to report 
thus far the issues of network layer mobility management 
protocols, such as MIPv6 in CRNs. Also, no prior works 
exist to show the impact of spectrum mobility alone on 
MIPv6. These observations call for a detailed analysis of 
MIPv6 in heterogeneous CRNs, which may give us an 
insight into the practical design issues of MIPv6 and the 
impact of spectrum mobility on IP handoffs.  
III. 
COGNITIVE RADIO ATTRIBUTE MODEL (CRAM) 
We have implemented CRAM in ns-3 [16]. It takes 
traffic parameters and spectrum selection strategy as input. 
We describe CRAM in the following three subsections. 
A. Traffic Parameters 
We consider network1 with C1 number of channels and 
network2 with C2 number of channels. At any point in time, 
each of these channels can be occupied by a PU or an SU or 
remains empty. We have assumed that network2 has higher 
preference over network1 for SUs, i.e., an SU switches to 
network1 if and only if network2 is unavailable. For 
simplicity, 
we 
have 
assumed 
homogeneous 
traffic 
parameters for all channels and the PU traffic parameters are 
same for network1 and network2. We have assumed that the 
PU and SU arrival processes follow a Poisson distribution 
while their service times follow an exponential distribution. 
Table I lists the variables used in this section.

networks, we use the state transition diagram shown in Fig. 3

B. Spectrum Selection Strategies 
We 
have 
implemented 
three 
spectrum 
selection 
strategies: GDY [18][22], MRU [23], and LFU [24]. These 
strategies are implemented based on the statistical 
information of the channels. In GDY strategy, the SU selects 
the first empty channel without any pre-estimation of its 
freeness. The works in [18] and [22] on modeling and 
analysis of spectrum mobility events assumed GDY strategy 
(called first-come-first-served in their system model). The 
GDY strategy is an opportunistic one; it selects the first 
empty channel, not targeting to utilize the spectrum holes 
optimally [18]. In contrast, several other research works 
[10][23][24] adopt selection strategies to utilize spectrum 
holes efficiently for the purpose of load balancing among 
channels as well as reducing data transmission time and 
improving throughput of SUs. These works consider the 
typical heterogeneous CRN environment [10] with multiple 
PUs and SUs [18][23][24]. We also assume this type of 
scenario in this work. The MRU and LFU are selected as two 
efficient spectrum selection strategies based on the concepts 
applied in [23] and [24], respectively. In the MRU strategy, 
the SU selects the channel which has been used most 
recently by a PU, expecting a lengthy absence of PUs in that 
channel in the near future. In LFU strategy, the SU selects 
the channel which has been least used by the PUs thus far, 
hoping that it will remain so in the near future too. We have 
assumed the arrival process of PUs follow Poisson 
distribution. The GDY strategy selects an idle channel 
randomly, not considering the available spectrum hole 
duration. On the other hand, the LFU strategy enhances the 
utilization rate of a low utilized channel. But, accessing the 
channel which has been used by a PU most recently, would 
give the high chance of getting longest spectrum hole due to 
the Poisson arrival of PUs. In this regard, MRU always 
selects the longer spectrum hole than the other two strategies.  
In Fig. 4, we have illustrated spectrum selection by a SU 
using these three strategies. At the time t1 and t2, the SU 
follows the GDY strategy to switch channel. At time t1, the 
SU selects the spectrum hole of the first channel of network1 
even though channel 3 is also empty. Similarly, at time t2, the 
SU selects the spectrum hole of the first channel of 
network2. At time t3, the SU follows MRU strategy and 
selects the spectrum hole of channel 2 of network1 as it is 
used most currently among the empty channels. At time t4, 
the SU uses LFU strategy to switch to channel 2 of network2 
as the usage percentage of the channel by PU is less than 
other free channels.

and Timer classes are used to schedule a task, such as 
assigning a channel to a SU/PU for a particular time interval 
and cancel it after completion of the task. The Simulator 
class is used for initial scheduling of the entire task in the 
simulation, i.e., it starts the PU and SU transmissions. The 
RandomVariable class is used to generate exponentially 
distributed random numbers. We used two schedulers: 
channel scheduler (Fig. 5) and SU scheduler (Fig. 6). The 
channel scheduler takes the mean value of λp and Xp as input. 
Following the distribution, the sequence generator generates 
a large number of sequences (over 1000). Each sequence 
consists of PU service time and duration of spectrum holes. 
During simulation, it makes the state of the channel either 
busy or free, based on the generated values. In the PU busy 
state, the channel scheduler starts the PU timer and makes 
the state as busy. After expiration of the PU timer, the free 
timer starts and the channel state becomes free. It would 
remain free up to the spectrum hole duration of the current 
sequence unless an SU sends a busy trigger. The SU busy 
trigger changes the channel state into busy state such that all 
SUs see that channel as busy. But, PU can interrupt the SU 
at any time and the SU has to move to another free channel 
or, pause state, if there is no free channel available. After 
expiration, it queries for the next sequence. A channel sensor 
database is implemented that acquires the channel 
information. 
 
In the SU scheduler, the user inputs its data transmission 
time and the spectrum selection strategy. The spectrum 
selection strategy acquires the channel information from all 
channels of all systems and makes a decision. It outputs the 
next channel number (k) and the remaining free time. If it 
gets the free time slot, it starts a transmission timer, giving a 
busy trigger to the kth channel scheduler. The start 
transmission functionality makes the SU’s network1 or, 
network2 netdevice state into ‘UP’. The Stop Transmission 
function makes the SU’s corresponding state into ‘Down’ 
state. If at any point in time, the spectrum selection strategy 
cannot find a free channel, it pauses for a predefined timer 
value. After expiration of the pause timer, it again runs the 
spectrum selection strategy.

MIPV6 ISSUES IN CRNS 
We have developed our own MIPv6 module [17] for ns-3 
(as it is not available currently) on top of CRAM. 
A. Simulation setup 
We have considered two networks: network1 and 
network2 containing 20 and 10 channels respectively. The 
SU is opportunistic to network2. We used a constant position 
mobility model for the SUs because we are not interested in 
spatial mobility. We used λp = 1.5 and E[Ns] = 4. Since 
multiple SUs are used, the contention among the SUs to 
access the same spectrum hole is managed through periodic 
sensing as shown in Fig. 2. It is to be noted that, for 
simplicity, we have measured the throughput performance 
of single SU. We used exponentially distributed connections 
with average connection length 480 bytes [25]. So, when the 
data rate of primary connection is 19.2 Kbps [25], we have 
E[Xp]= (480*8)/(19.2*103)=0.2 s. The Pause timeout value 
and spectrum handoff delay are set as 0.05 s and 0.01 s, 
respectively. The correspondent node (CN) and SU are 
running ‘UDP Echo’ application and transferring packets at 
the rate of 80 Kbps. In this simulation, we keep the data rate 
fixed for all the PUs and the SUs. The whole simulation is 
run for 1000 s. However, we present only the results selected 
from 100 s. to 200 s. to highlight the design issues.

B. High RA Interval and Lifetime Period 
1) Problem Description 
If the duration of spectrum holes is very small, an SU 
may switch from one network (say network2) to another (say 
network1), reside there for a very short time, and then may 
return to network2 again. When the SU switches to 
network1, the address configured in network2 still remains 
valid for some more time. If it returns to network2 quickly, it 
could use the previously configured CoA in network2, giving 
rise to two issues. First, when the SU is in network1, another 
SU in network2 may configure the same CoA and execute 
DAD procedure. The DAD procedure detects the address as 
valid for obvious reasons. So, when the SU returns to 
network2 quickly, duplicate addresses would exist in 
network2 even if the DAD procedure detects no duplicity. 
So, the SU will use duplicate CoA in CRN if it makes a 
quick return in the old network. Second, the binding update 
and tunnel setup procedures in MIPv6 are always triggered 
after the completion of the DAD procedure. So, if the SU 
uses a previously configured CoA in network2, those 
procedures are skipped. Since MIPv6 is not triggered, the 
tunnel set up between the SU and its home agent (HA) would 
still be the older one and the traffic would not be redirected 
towards the SU. As a result, the performance of the SU 
degrades drastically. 
To illustrate the problem we have performed simulations 
for the RA-based and RS-based MIPv6 cases, but not for 
DHCP-based MIPv6, because DHCP eliminates the DAD 
period, and thus, does not suffer from this problem. In Fig. 7, 
we illustrate the impact of high RA interval and lifetime 
duration on packet flow in CRNs for RA-based MIPv6. First, 
we used MaxRAInterval=3 s and MinRAInterval=1 s 
as given in [14]. So, after switching back to network1, the 
SU does not perform MIPv6 operations for a long time due 
to high RA interval and lifetime period. This is evident from 
long gaps in packet sequence number in Fig. 7. Next, we 
decreased 
the 
values 
of 
the 
RA 
interval 
to 
MaxRAInterval=0.07 s and MinRAInterval=0.03 s. The 
corresponding simulation result (Fig. 7) shows that MIPv6 is 
unable to work gracefully, resulting in long gaps in packet 
sequence number. So, we further reduced the values of RA 
intervals to 7ms (MaxRAInterval) and 3ms (MinRAInterval), 
and then we found that all MIPv6 operations are completed 
successfully (Fig. 7). We also observed that, under this 
circumstance, a large number of control packets are being 
generated, leading to congestion. So, we argue that the RA 
interval and lifetime period must be set considerably low in 
order to be appropriate for use in CRNs. 
In Fig. 8, we illustrate that problem for RS-based MIPv6, 
taking the same set of values of RA interval and lifetime 
period. In this case, RS is sent by an SU after the link layer 
attachment and access point returns RA in response to RS. 
So, the RA delay is reduced but not completely eliminated. 
In this case, the SU receives RA more quickly than in the 
previous case. But, since the previously configured address 
still remains valid, the problem becomes more severe than 
RA-based MIPv6. The difference is seen in case of RA 
interval between 1-3 s. Comparing Figs. 7 and 8, we observe 
that there are more gaps in packet sequence number in RS-
based MIPv6 than that in RA-based MIPv6. So, RS-based 
MIPv6, which actually reduces handoff delay, degrades 
performance much more than RA-based MIPv6 does. 
However, this difference is not seen in cases of small RA 
intervals like 30-70 ms and 3-7 ms, as the RA interval and 
RS delay are almost the same in these cases.

2) Validation with the Numerical Results 
To validate the ‘MIPv6 not triggered’ problem, we use 
the MIPv6 handoff parameters given in Table II. The timing 
diagram, shown in Fig. 9, presents the timing of RA message 
reception by the SU and the behavior of address expiry timer 
in case of RA-based MIPv6. After getting RA in network2, 
the SU switches to network1 following a spectrum handoff 
and returns back to network2 that provides the RA message 
again. The address expiry timer is last updated when the SU 
receives the RA message before switching to network1, as 
indicated in Fig. 9. After switching back to network2, the old 
address, previously configured in network2, is not expired 
and the SU uses that address without configuring a new 
address Hence, DAD is not performed and MIPv6 is not 
triggered. After getting RA in network2 again, the life time 
timer will be updated again. So, the total time elapsed 
between these two updates is
TSH

. Here, we 
assume the spectrum hole duration as W/2, instead of W, 
because the SU acquires the spectrum hole randomly in 
between 0 to W interval. The ‘MIPv6 not triggered’ problem 
happens if the valid lifetime is greater than the elapsed time 
between two updates in network2. So, the probability of the 
problem can be calculated as follows:

In the previous case, if the SU continues in network1, 
even after PU interrupt, due to channel unavailability in 
network2, then the stay time in network1 will increase. For 
two such PU interruptions, the spectrum hole value would be 
2*W/2. So if the SU returns to network2 after ‘n’ PU 
interrupts in network1, then the probability of ‘MIPv6 not 
triggered’ problem would be:

It is to be noted that the RA delay depends upon the RA 
intervals set by the AR and the attachment timing of the SU 
to the new link. As given in [26], RA can be given as follows:

It is to be noted that the RS delay is two times the 
wireless hop delay, i.e., Rs=2*τ. The total probability of 
‘MIPv6 not triggered’ problem can be computed in the 
similar way as in (15). 
The validation graphs for RA-based and RS-based 
MIPv6 are shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, respectively. 
Taking τ=0.1 ms, Rm=30 ms, and RM=70 ms, we vary TVL to 
obtain the total probability of occurrence of ‘MIPv6 not 
triggered’ problem. In our simulation, we find this 
probability by counting occurrences of the problem and 
dividing it by the total number of switches from network1 to 
network2. It is to be noted that the chance of occurrence of 
the problem will increase if W in network1 is less than TVL in 
network2. The time of stay of SU in network1 mainly 
depends on W, which is an exponential variable with mean 
0.52 s, computed using (12). So, if TVL is increased from 0 to 
the mean of W, there is a sharp increase in the probability 
due to the increase in the number of spectrum holes. For 
TVL=0.52 s to TVL=1.0 s, there are fewer cases where W lies 
between mean of W and TVL. First, the frequency of spectrum 
holes decreases after the mean due to its exponential 
property. Second, the stay time of SU in network1 depends 
on the number of PU interruptions and the probability of 
high PU interruptions is small, as indicated in (15). So, the 
rate of increase in probability is slow in this period. It is to be 
noted that, in both graphs, the numerical results almost 
match with the simulation results, which validates our 
simulation work. 
C. High DAD Period 
1) Problem Description 
RFC 6275 [9] has mentioned the default DAD period as 
1 s, which may be higher than the considered duration of 
spectrum holes in CRNs. Whenever an SU switches to a new 
network, the address configuration procedure – in particular, 
the DAD procedure – consumes almost the entire spectrum 
hole, and hence, the spectrum hole cannot be used for data

transmission at all (Fig. 13 and Fig. 14). So, the throughput 
of SUs degrades in CRNs. For this reason, the DAD period 
must also be reduced to make MIPv6 more effective in 
CRNs.

For the successful completion of the MIPv6 handoff 
process, the handoff delay must be less than the spectrum 
hole value. So the ‘incomplete IP handoff’ problem for one 
PU 
interruption 
happens 
if 
the 
condition, 
W/2< 
TL+RA+TDAD+TBU holds. For ‘n’ PU interruptions, the

Assuming, S=2*THO, we can compute the total probability of 
‘incomplete IP handoff’ problem using (15), by replacing L 
by S. In case of RS-based MIPv6, RA is to be replaced by RS 
in (19). The total probability can be computed in the similar 
way as given in (15). 
The validation graphs for ‘incomplete IP handoff’ 
problem are shown in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 in the case of RA-
based and RS-based MIPv6, respectively. Taking TL=10 ms 
and TBU=23 ms, we vary TDAD to obtain the total probability 
of occurrence of ‘incomplete IP handoff’ problem in 
network1. The ‘incomplete IP handoff’ problem occurs if the 
IP handoff delay is higher than the spectrum hole duration. It 
is known that TDAD is the dominant delay component in the 
IP handoff delay. So, the chance of the problem will increase 
if we increase TDAD. We observed that the frequency of W in 
network1 is high but with small spectrum hole durations for 
TDAD=0 to TDAD=0.52 s. due to its exponential nature. So, 
with increase in TDAD from 0 to 0.52 s, the probability of 
occurrence of the problem increases sharply. Also due to the 
exponential nature of W, for TDAD= 0.52 s to TDAD=1.0 s, the 
frequency of W is reduced with small spectrum hole 
duration. So, the rate of increase in the probability is slow in 
this period. It is to be noted that the numerical results nearly 
match with the simulation results, thereby validating the 
correctness of our simulation.

ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF SPECTRUM MOBILITY 
In this section, we present the main results and discuss 
their implications at length. Here, we have made some minor 
changes in the simulation setup used in Section IV-A, in 
order to bring in more randomness in the availability of 
spectrum holes. The channels of CRAM are characterized as 
either of high usage or of low usage, to benefit from LFU 
and MRU strategies. We have used λp, E[Xp], and E[Ns] 
variables to control the emptiness of the channels (Table III). 
Also, to alleviate the problems explained in Section IV, we 
have taken 7 ms and 3 ms for MaxRAInterval and 
MinRAInterval, respectively. The preferred lifetime values 
are assumed to be 0.5 s and 1 s, respectively. The simulation 
has been performed for RA-based and DHCP-based MIPv6 
only, and not for RS-based MIPv6. This is because, for small 
RA intervals, RS-based MIPv6 behaves almost similarly as 
RA-based MIPv6 does. 
We have randomly assigned either E[Xp]HIGH or 
E[Xp]LOW values in all 30 channels, while keeping E[Ns]=4. 
Increasing λp increases the frequency of spectrum holes but 
with reduced duration of each. From Fig. 17, we observe 
that, up to λp≤2.8, the number of IP handoffs increases sub-
linearly, and, for λp>2.8, the frequency drops abruptly. So 
PU arrival rate of 3 per s acts as a kind of threshold for this 
experimental setting. We note that, for 0.1≤λp≤2.2, all IP 
handoffs are completed successfully due to sufficiently large 
spans of the spectrum holes. As a result, the throughput of 
the SU is reduced only slightly (this reduction is primarily 
due to the lengthy handoff operation of MIPv6) as shown in 
Figure 15.   Validation graph for “incomplete IP handoff”  
problem in RA-based MIPv6

Fig. 18. For 2.2˂λp≤2.8, some spectrum holes become 
squeezed resulting in few incomplete IP handoffs. However, 
the number of incomplete handoffs is not significant enough 
to cause drastic degradation in the throughput of the SUs 
(Fig. 18). But, when λp>2.8, the spectrum holes become 
really small to allow almost any handoff to be finished in 
such a short duration. So, the SUs do not get the opportunity 
to complete spectrum handoff as well as IP handoff most of 
the time. In this case, the SUs cycle between pause and 
channel sensing phases (Fig. 2), thereby reducing the 
throughput of the SUs drastically (Fig. 18). However, in the 
case of DHCP-based MIPv6, incomplete IP handoff does 
not occur at all because DAD process is not used; as a 
result, there is no sharp degradation of throughput initially 
(Fig. 19). But, beyond λp=2.2, the holes become too small to 
allow completion of handoff; SUs start to cycle between 
pause and channel sensing phases (Fig. 2); so there is a 
gradual degradation of throughput performance (Fig. 19). 
Comparatively, DHCP-based MIPv6 performs better than 
the other two versions do, implying that the former could be 
a better choice in CRNs. 
Now, we focus our attention to the selection strategies 
(different colors in Figs. 18 and 19 indicate them). Fig. 18 
shows that, for λp≤2.2, the MRU strategy performs better 
than LFU and GDY strategies. This is because the MRU 
strategy always finds those free channels, which can be used 
for a longer period of time without needing to perform 
another IP handoff shortly. That is not true for the other two 
strategies. However, when λp>2.2, the average spectrum hole 
duration becomes very small and is entirely consumed by the 
MIPv6 handoff procedure in all the three spectrum selection 
strategies. So, all three performs equally bad then. Since 
MRU always selects the longest spectrum hole, it wastes 
more time than other two strategies in RA-based MIPv6 
(Fig. 18). However, in case of DHCP-based MIPv6, wastage 
of spectrum hole due to MIPv6 handoff operation is reduced. 
Hence, MRU strategy performs better than LFU and GDY 
do (Fig. 19). 
For 0.1≤E[Xp]≤0.4, the number of IP handoffs is 
increasing. In particular, for 0.1≤E[Xp]≤0.3, all IP handoffs 
are completed successfully, leading to minor throughput 
degradation largely due to lengthy MIPv6 handoff operation 
only (Fig. 20). But, for 0.3<E[Xp]≤0.4, most of the IP 
handoffs are incomplete. As a result, the throughput of the 
SUs drops quickly (Fig. 21). Also, when E[Xp]>0.4, the 
number of IP handoffs itself is reduced because the SUs are 
mostly cycling between channel sensing and pause phases 
(Fig. 2). As a result, the throughput of the SUs degrades 
sharply (Fig. 20). In DHCP-based MIPv6, for E[Xp]<0.4, all 
IP handoffs are successfully completed due to elimination of 
TDAD. But, for E[Xp]>0.4, the SUs are unable to find

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We have analyzed the number of IP handoffs resulting 
from spectrum mobility in the absence of spatial mobility. 
Our study has carried out a root-cause analysis of the 
observation that MIPv6 cannot work properly in CRNs, and 
reveals that it is due to high values of RA interval, lifetime 
period of CoA, and DAD period. That is why the 
performance of MIPv6 degrades considerably especially 
when the spectrum holes are becoming smaller with more 
PUs turning active at a higher rate. So, our first 
recommendation is that the values for these parameters must 
be reduced to appropriate levels for possible use of MIPv6 in 
CRNs.  
Our second conclusion is that, for lower values of PU 
traffic parameters, MRU and LFU have better performance 
than GDY has; but, for higher values of those parameters, 
GDY is better than MRU and LFU. Our future work includes 
design a dynamic spectrum selection strategy to fit with 
MIPv6 for heterogeneous spectrum mobility scenarios in 
CRNs in order to improve the throughput of SUs further.
