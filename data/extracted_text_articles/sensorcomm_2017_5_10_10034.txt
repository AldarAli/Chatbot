Abstract—Efficient underwater localization is a challenging 
issue as the need for underwater convergence systems increases. 
In this paper, we present a method of position recognition for 
underwater mobile devices equipped with pressure and gyro 
sensors. In the proposed scheme, at least two cooperating 
surface nodes (or one surface node having two separate 
transducers) and two discrete-time data are required to 
recognize position. The main idea and procedure are addressed 
here and its prototype and experimental results will be 
provided in a following research paper.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, there has been increased interest in underwater 
convergence systems, e.g., smart fish farm, mission-critical 
underwater robot, immersive marine leisure activities, water 
quality monitoring and maintenance. For these applications, 
the use of moving objects, such as underwater device, 
vehicle, drone, or mobile sensor node, would be very helpful 
if deployed together. Meanwhile, one of the major problems 
related to the underwater systems supporting mobility is 
location awareness because radio frequency (RF) based 
global positioning system (GPS) that is commonly used in 
terrestrial networks does not work in underwater. 
Some studies focused on the localization of underwater 
wireless acoustic sensor network (UWASN) can be found in 
the literature [1][4]. Typically, in range-based schemes, 
three dimensional localization is simplified to a problem 
estimating the coordinates in two dimensions owing to Time 
of Arrival (ToA) measurement and a pressure sensor. In this 
work, we propose an efficient localization scheme utilizing a 
gyroscope in which the degree of freedom for an estimate of 
location is reduced. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
addresses the general system model of underwater 
localization. Section III describes the main principle and 
procedure of the proposed location awareness scheme. In 
Section IV, concluding remarks on the direction for further 
work close the article.

SYSTEM MODEL 
A conceptual diagram of range-based underwater 
localization is shown in Figure 1, where three anchor nodes, 
𝐴1, 𝐴2, and 𝐴3, are located at water surface and an object is 
launched underwater. It is assumed that ToA is measured at 
each anchor and a pressure sensor is mounted at the object. 
Then, an anchor node, e.g., 𝐴1, easily knows the projected 
radius 𝑟1  from the distance information 𝑑1  and the water 
depth information 𝐷1. Since other anchor nodes can calculate 
their projected radii in a similar way, the location of the 
object is finally determined as the intersection of three 
circles.

PROPOSED LOCALIZATION SCHEME 
A. Gyroscope-Assisted Localization 
The basic assumption of the proposed range-based 
localization scheme is that two anchor nodes are placed at 
water surface and a mobile object equipped with a gyroscope 
exists underwater. Then, the main idea is as follows. At an 
arbitrary time, each anchor node extracts its projected radius 
from distance and depth information. The red-colored solid 
circles in Figure 2 represent the trajectories with the radii of 
𝑟1 and 𝑟2, which informs us that the object is located at either 
𝑋 or 𝑋′. After a predetermined time, the entities taking part 
in the localization process repeat the same task, i.e., the 
object provides distance and depth information again and

two anchor nodes acquire the blue-colored dotted trajectories 
as shown in Figure 2, which means that the current possible 
locations of the object are 𝑌  or 𝑌′ . Consequently, there 
remain four candidates on the movement of the object: 1) 𝑋 
to 𝑌, 2) 𝑋 to 𝑌′, 3) 𝑋′ to 𝑌, 4) 𝑋′ to 𝑌′. Further, since the 
object reports the direction of its movement acquired from a 
gyroscope to anchor nodes, an estimate among four 
candidates is finally chosen and the localization process is 
terminated. 
It is noted that the accuracy of the proposed scheme will 
be improved if the number of time samples or anchor nodes 
increases. Also, a single anchor node having two transducers 
apart from each other could replace the two anchor nodes 
shown in Figure 2.

time samples. 
B. Localization Procedure 
The specific procedure of the proposed localization 
scheme is given as follows. 
 
A master anchor node (or an onshore station or an 
anchor node having two transducers) initiates a 
localization process. 
 
The master anchor node sends a broadcasting 
message underwater. 
 
The moving object responds to it with depth 
information and two anchor nodes calculate each 
projected radius from the acquired depth information 
and the estimated distance information. 
 
After a predetermined time, the master anchor node 
sends the broadcasting message again. 
 
The moving object responds to it with the direction 
of movement as well as depth information, and then 
the two anchor nodes calculate each projected radius 
again. 
 
The master anchor node calculates the location of the 
moving object based on the trajectories provided at 
two time instants and the direction information and 
this terminates the localization process.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this article, an idea of gyroscope-assisted localization 
for underwater mobile communication systems has been 
proposed. The direction of movement as well as range and 
depth information is utilized in the algorithm to help find 
location. The proposed scheme reduces the number of 
anchors required for the position recognition of an 
underwater moving object at the expense of complexity 
increase for the use of a gyro sensor. 
As subsequent work, it is worth investigating other 
simple and efficient schemes for underwater localization 
using multiple sensors, specifically focused on acceleration 
sensor and magnetometer sensor. The implementation and 
verification of the proposed schemes are also challenging 
problems to be addressed.
