Abstract—The purpose of this study is to explore the use of
public cloud computing by the US Federal Government lever-
aging dynamic systems modeling and system thinking methods.
A historical analysis of public cloud hyperscale service provider
growth and Federal Government cloud consumption is conducted
as a baseline to highlight significant milestones over the past fif-
teen years. A stakeholder interest map is established to determine
the endogenous and exogenous elements of our study, and a novel
dynamic model is developed to capture the feedback loops, stocks,
and flows, as well as multi-dimensional relationships between the
variables presented. To prevent large and potentially harmful
oscillations, cloud diversity principles such as interoperability
and security are presented which promote both balance and
sustainability in the system. The primary hypothesis is that self-
reinforcing feedback loops which represent the consumption of
public cloud services will be constrained by goal-seeking loops
which represent Federal Information Technology (IT) budget
limitations and macroeconomic fluctuations. To conclude, areas
such as model enhancement through greater quantitative analysis
as well as recommendations for further research on this topic are
proposed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The US federal IT budget for the fiscal year 2022 is approximately
92.4 billion dollars [1]. Over ten percent of that amount is projected
to be utilized towards the consumption of public cloud services
by government agencies. This double-digit percentage has increased
exponentially over the past five years and appears to accelerate as
new use cases are discovered and demand increases. The shift from
privately run government data centers to cloud-hosted infrastructure
has accelerated over the past decade as security and resiliency of these
platforms and services have finally met stringent government com-
pliance requirements [2][3]. With digital transformation initiatives
now in progress from multiple areas of government, a new problem
is forming and related to increasing spend on these premium cloud
services.
With a seemingly endless supply of computing resources available
public cloud vendors such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have
capitalized on the shift from on-premises maintained compute, net-
work, and storage systems to offsite third-party operated platforms.
With business agility comes some trade-offs, primarily associated
with less control and visibility around the complete spend of manag-
ing and maintaining these environments. Cloud vendors are intent on
increasing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), boosting their share
price and overall profitability. While this incentive leads sales teams
to position large transformational deals, the customer (in our case,
the federal government) must make careful selections and ensure
the proper controls are in place to prevent sprawl in the resources
provided [4][5][6][7].
In a previously published research paper titled "Preventing E-
Government Tragedy Of The Clouds Using System Thinking Meth-
ods", we developed a cloud service ontology, used a systemigram to
highlight system connections, and proposed a novel cloud efficiency
model [8]. In this study, we focus on the multi-dimensional nature
of an E-government system leveraging public cloud infrastructure
to define causal relationships to understand multi-loop behavior. In
Section 2a, a timeline is developed to highlight significant milestones
in both E-government use of the public cloud and the beginnings
and dynamic growth of the big three hyperscalers, Amazon Web
Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. In Section
2b, we explore our system’s endogenous and exogenous agents with a
stakeholder interest map. Section 2c presents a causal loop diagram to
display the variables in our system and show the relationship, polarity,
and behavior of this multi-loop structure. Section 2d introduces cloud
diversity principles, a road map for E-government entities to leverage
public cloud resources more efficiently and effectively. We touch
upon portability, security, and interoperability of the system to ensure
we are creating a future state architecture that is sustainable and
resilient. In Section 3, we conclude with our hypothesis, constraints,
and ideas for further research to enhance the body of knowledge
around this topic.
A. Definitions
E-government is defined as the delivery of government services via
information and communication technology (ICT) efficiently to both
businesses and citizens [9][10]. E-Government refers to the delivery
of government services via Information and Communication Tech-
nology (ICT) efficiently to Citizens (G2C), Businesses (G2B), Gov-
ernment Employees (G2E), and other Government Entities (G2G). It
also infers the use of digital technologies such as computer systems
and mobile platforms. Cloud computing, as defined by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is "a model for en-
abling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned
and released with minimal management effort or service provider
interaction"[1]. Hyperscalers are cloud service providers; as their
name denotes, they have the ability to rapidly scale compute resources
from geographically dispersed data centers. Hyperscalers focused on
for this study will be Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure,
and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as those are the largest based on
current market share and customer base, and adoption. Cloud service
models are categorized as public, private, and hybrid. Public refers
to a third-party managed service, and private is typically owned and
operated by the organization requiring the services, hybrid refers to an
entitiy that uses infrastructure and services which traverse both public
and private. Some of the prominent cloud service offerings are AWS
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Azure Active Directory (AAD), and
Google’s Big Data Service (BDS) [11][12].
B. Problem Statement
The rate of US Federal IT spending on public cloud services has
been growing exponentially over the past ten years. Over 10% of the
US Federal Government’s IT budget is now used for public cloud
services which are consumed in a “utility” model [13][14]. Unlike

capital expenses for on-premises data center hardware and software,
the cost of public cloud services is difficult to quantify and predict.
Macroeconomic volatility presents an enhanced socioeconomic risk.
A strategy is therefore proposed to ensure diversification through
governance.
The research goal is to use systems thinking and systems dynam-
ics methods to establish boundaries of the system under analysis,
examine the causal relationships of system elements and propose a
cloud sustainability model that is based on principles, not process
[15][16][17]. The motivation of this study is to contribute to the
body of knowledge towards a significant and timely problem that
is beginning to present itself in E-Government and may have far-
reaching economic consequences if not adequately addressed.
C. Research Questions
The following are research questions we aspire to answer in this
study:
1) What are the endogenous and exogenous boundaries for mod-
eling E-Government consumption of public cloud computing
resources?
2) Using a causal structure, how do you model the Federal US
Government IT consumption of Public Cloud Services?
3) How can you represent the life cycle of Public Cloud services
in a dynamic model?
4) Are there factors that may limit the long-term growth of Cloud
service utilization in E-Government?
II. APPROACH & METHODS
The foundational method employed for this study was a system-
atic literature review. The inclusion and exclusion criteria involved
selecting conference papers and scholarly journal papers via major
academic search engines such as IEEE Xplore, Academic Search
Premiere, and Scopus. The time frame selected was from 2006 to
the present as the modern concept of cloud computing is relatively
new and was formed alongside the Hyperscaler organizations such
as AWS, Microsoft, and Google.
Systems thinking methods are used to identify the primary stake-
holders and their endogenous and exogenous boundaries. Causal loop
diagrams provide an overview of reinforcing and balancing elements
in our analysis. Stock and flow dynamic diagrams are also represented
to quantify the accumulation and drainage of elements such as budget
amounts. Valves provide us with the rate of inflows and, in our
model, connect to the causal loops. By employing a multi-disciplinary
approach, the data collected can be observed from multiple angles
leading to a more thorough analysis and conceptual understanding of
the research.
A. Timeline
In Figure 1, green markers represent the launch dates of Amazon
Web Services in 2006, Google Cloud Platform in 2008, and Microsoft
Azure in 2010. The pillars in blue represent significant milestones
in the public cloud, such as the modern cloud computing concept
introduction by then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt. This is followed
by AWS’s significant expansion in Europe and Asia, which is now
gaining global traction for its public cloud services. In 2016 the
Gartner magic quadrant was released for infrastructure as a service,
with only three companies in the Leadership quadrants showing how
far behind the others have fallen.
Events in orange denote the milestones of government public
cloud adoption. Changes, such as creating a Federal cloud computing
PMO in 2009 and passing the Modernizing Government Technology
(MGT) act, allow government agencies to begin to invest in public
cloud services. Markers in dark grey show dynamic year-over-year
double-digit hyperscaler revenue growth, hitting 81% in 2015. In
2021, the Federal IT budget allocation for the public cloud topped
ten billion and exceeded 10% of the total funding. The final red

marker shows the recent downward trend in all three hyperscaler
organizations leading to extensive tech industry layoffs.
B. Boundary
In an effort to define the endogenous and exogenous elements,
key system stakeholders and orient our study, Figure 2 presents a
stakeholder interest map.
Fig. 2. Stakeholder Interest Map.
Internal to this study are what we consider E-Government primary
consumers: citizens, businesses, government employees, and alternate
government agencies. Also endogenous in this model are the public
cloud operations and customer success teams which partner with
value-added resellers to provide professional services and support
based on requirement [18]. Utility providers and clean energy partners
deliver services that power, cool, and regulate the large tier-four data
centers. Exogenous stakeholders include alternate (non-big-three)
cloud service providers, Federal data center operations teams, and
co-location providers.
Multiple stakeholders straddle endogenous and exogenous bound-
aries, such as information system security providers, as they serve
both the public and private sectors. Also, US citizens who do not use
E-Government services still contribute to taxes that fund budgets, so
they cannot be entirely removed from the endogenous stakeholder
list.
C. Causal Loop
A causal structure model is presented in Figure 3 and focuses on E-
Government service development [13][19]. The first stock represents
an accumulation of services that are currently in development. The
valve following into this stock is the rate of new projects. Out of the
E-government services development stock flows a link with a positive
8

polarity to the expected service rejection rate, which is expected
based on evaluations of solutions. Connected to service rejection are
the approvals, which have negative incoming polarity and a positive
one towards the expected increase in operational efficiency. New
services typically enhance effectiveness and lead to the next variable,
customer satisfaction rate, with a positive incoming polarity. Next
is the expected business value of new services, which completes
the chain and creates a clockwise balancing loop due to the single
negative polarity.
Fig. 3. Causal Loop.
Out of the E-government services, the stock also flows a pos-
itive connection to the service development rate valve, which has
a negative development delay relationship because any delay can
significantly impact our flow. On the model’s right side, we have
a stock representing E-Government services in production. Out of
that stock, there is a positive relationship to the service rejection
rate, reducing the IT budget stock down the line. There is a delay in
the IT budget in two directions; the arrow on the left is the budgeted
IT costs and has a positive polarity towards the expected approvals
variable. Flowing in the opposite direction of the IT budget stock is
another delay towards the desired new capabilities of the individual
government agencies. There is a positive relationship between these
new desired capabilities and the demand for new services, which
has a negative relationship with the service rejection rate, creating
another counter-clockwise balancing loop. The service rejection rate
connects to the expected service rejection rate with positive polarity,
making our final complete loop another clockwise balancing loop.
Completing the model is a negative polarity from the average
life of services to the service decommission rate valve. This value
connects to the opposite flow of the rate of new project charters
denoting that as services are retired, new services are being formed
in their place. The final variables which affect our model are E-
Government growth positively connected to the demand for additional
resources, and this increased demand having a positive polarity
towards the demand for new services.
D. Cloud Diversity Principles
Cloud diversity principles, shown in Figure 4, provide a strategic
way that E-Government entities can evaluate the public cloud solu-
tions and make determinations based on principles over process. Prin-
ciples were selected based on their level of importance and impact as
it relates to cloud operating paradigms. These areas were consistently
referenced in the literature and related cloud computing case studies
hence their inclusion in the framework. A thorough understanding
of vendor cost models, including resource consumption, falls under
the economical principle. This involves understanding per unit costs,
terms of service, and the value chain of public cloud adoption.
It is critical to understand how pricing is established to ensure
the predictability of spend for budgetary purposes. Interoperability
of services and platforms ensures that systems that are already
established have a level of integration to the public cloud service,
this prevents silos and greater efficiency of operational resources.
Fig. 4. Cloud Diversity Principles.
The ability to migrate data and workloads to disparate services is
a key tenant of the portability principle. Preventing vendor lock-in
scenarios and "sticky" service solutions is paramount to ensuring the
most cost-effective landing zones can be utilized and open universal
formats are adopted. The final principle is security which should
be intrinsic to the architecture and follow defense-in-depth tenets.
Defense-in-depth refers to the use of multiple security mechanisms
such as firewalls, endpoint agents, or intrusion prevention and detec-
tion systems deployed in layers on the target system. Heuristics have
become increasingly important as the types of cybersecurity threats
have grown, the system should have an early detection mechanism
and understand anomalous behavior with automated remediation
processes.
III. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
E-Government will continue to grow due to the exponential
demand for digital services. The next generations will expect gov-
ernment services to be easily accessible via mobile platforms with
fast access to data and relevant content. For this reason, public cloud
services and their respective capabilities will be necessary to build
future iterations of innovative applications and public sector cloud-
hosted services. We first set our boundary via a systemigram in Figure
1 and showed the interconnections of these endogenous components.
Next, we explored our first causal relationship diagram in Figure
2, which highlighted the multi-dimensional loops and balancing
behavior as a result of the stock, flows, and variable linkages. In
Figure 3, we leveraged the aging chain and logically segmented the
system by the maturity of services through the system. We can model
the effect of time on and quantify the rates at which E-Government
services get evaluated, moved into a production environment, and
finally move towards decommissioning, and replacement [20][21].
Research questions related to the boundary, causal structure, as
well as service life-cycle have been addressed via our models.
Factors that may limit the long-term growth of cloud services in
E-Government should be addressed with a more quantitative model;
therefore, any results have a low degree of accuracy; this also holds
true for the question around the quantitative significance of factors re-
lated to development velocity, budgetary constraints as well as service
retirement rates [10]. While we have leveraged multiple models to test
our hypotheses, the ones we employed are more basic in nature. This
is due to the time allotted for the study as well as research experience
with these dynamic tools. To further this research, a greater dive with
more profound expertise on the subject would be required to build
out the quantitative models that accurately depict this E-Government
service adoption and budgeting life-cycle. The data collection process
for this research was rudimentary and would yield more accurate
results if additional rigor and time were allocated. A literature review
with greater depth and acceptance criteria could also bolster the

quality of our overall study. Some additional areas of research which
could be complementary to this study would be focused on the E-
Government application development process, associated toolchains,
and possibly enablement methods to understand if more significant
outcomes can be achieved through the build-out of a new government
innovation lab. This would involve the government operating like
a start-up and attracting top-tier technical talent, typically captured
by big tech companies. This would be a significant shift based on
how government IT operations have traditionally operated but not
impossible; it would take a shift in mindset and policy, which is not
impossible.
