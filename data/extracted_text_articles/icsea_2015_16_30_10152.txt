Abstract— Open Source Software has evolved dramatically in 
the last twenty years and now many open source products are 
considered similar, or better, than proprietary solutions. The 
result is that the trustworthiness of some open source products 
is now very high and the motivations for adopting an open 
source product over a proprietary product has changed in the 
last ten years.  For this reason, we ran a mixed research 
approach, composed of three empirical studies, so as to identify 
the motivations for the adoption of open source products. The 
goal is to take a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in FLOSS 
motivation’s adoption. Results show that the economical 
aspects and the freedom of some type of licenses are not the 
main adoption drivers any more while other motivations such 
as the ease of customization and ethical reasons are currently 
considered more important. 
Keywords-Open Source Adoption; Empirical Study; Open 
Source Quality. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Previous research on the adoption of Free/Libre Open 
Source Software (FLOSS) has mainly focused on adoption 
models, such as MOSS [1], Open BQR [2], QSOS [3], and 
others based on the evaluation of a set of information usually 
considered by potential users when they select a new FLOSS 
product.  
Some works highlight economic or technological reasons 
[4][5][6] but, to the best of our knowledge, only a few of 
these studies investigated the factors considered during the 
adoption 
of 
FLOSS 
by 
different 
organization[6][7]. 
Therefore, the goal of this study is to understand the current 
reasons that drive the adoption of FLOSS in IT companies, 
using a research approach that promises to obtain a more 
complete picture of the motivations for FLOSS adoption. 
This led to the definition of the following research question:  
RQ1: What are the motivation drivers behind the choice 
of a specific FLOSS product over proprietary software? 
In order to answer our research question, we designed a 
mixed research approach, composed of three empirical 
studies. We started with a first round of interviews to 
identify the high level motivations for the adoption. Then, 
the motivations were refined and clustered by means of a 
focus group with experts in FLOSS adoption. Finally, we 
conducted a survey to understand the importance of the 
motivations identified from the adopter’s point of view.  
Results of this work show that the motivations for the 
adoption of FLOSS have evolved in the last years and 
economical aspects and the license type are not as important 
as in the past [6] while other motivations, such as the ease of 
customization and ethical reasons are considered more 
important.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the related works. Section III addresses the 
research approach used. Section IV describes the results 
obtained. In Section V, we discuss results and in Section IV 
we present threats to validity. Finally, in Section VI we draw 
conclusion and future studies.  
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
In our previous work [6], we conducted a survey with 
151 FLOSS stakeholders, with different roles and 
responsibilities, about the factors that they consider most 
important when assessing whether FLOSS is trustworthy. 
Here, we did not ask the motivations for the adoption of a 
FLOSS product or a proprietary one, but we asked for the 
factors considered to compare two FLOSS products.  
We identified 37 factors, clustered in five groups: 
economic, license, development process, product quality, 
customer-oriented requirements. The product reliability and 
the degree to which a FLOSS product satisfies functional 
requirements turned out to be the most important factors for 
a 
trustworthy 
product, 
immediately 
followed 
by 
interoperability, availability of technical documentation, 
maintainability, standard compliance and mid-/long-term 
existence of a user community. Economic factors, such as 
Return on Investment (ROI) and Total Cost of Ownership 
(TCO), and the availability of a solid maintainer organization 
were far from being considered as relevant, as was widely 
publicized.  
Yan et al [9] ran a survey with students as participants, to 
identify the motivations for the adoption of FLOSS in 
Malaysia, China, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, 
collecting 264 questionnaires for FLOSS adopters and 212 
for non-adopters. They identified a set Intrinsic Motivation 
(to know, to accomplish, and to experience stimulation), and 
extrinsic motivations (identified regulation, “introjected 
regulation” and external regulation).  
Previous works discuss some economic motivations 
[4][10], suggesting TCO and ROI as the most important 
driver for FLOSS adoption.  
Other motivations can be derived by the information 
required by the FLOSS adoption models. These models are 
based on the evaluations of a set of information, weighted for 
their importance. Some models allow users to define the 
importance of some information, and to evaluate the product

they are willing to adopt. The most important methods in this 
category are the Open Business Readiness Rating 
(OpenBRR)[13], 
the 
Open 
Source 
Maturity 
Model 
(OSMM)[12], the Qualification and Selection of Open 
Source Software (QSOS)[3] and the Open Business Quality 
Rating (OpenBQR)[2] that summarizes the benefits of the 
previous three models. All these models, suggest to evaluate 
economic factors, license, development process, product 
quality but only QSOS and OpenBQR add customer related 
factors, such as the degree of which a product satisfies the 
customer requirement. Other evaluation models are based on 
a set of predefined weight for each information and allow 
predicting the trustworthiness or the likelihood of the 
adoption of a specific FLOSS product. An example is the 
MOSS model[1], based on the results obtained in [6]. 
Also in case of the evaluation models, there is an 
indication on the information that should be evaluated, but 
the motivations of the choice are not clearly identified.  
Finally, a Gartner’s report [17] shows that the top three 
reasons for using FLOSS from manager’s point of view are 
the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), the improved security 
and the strategic and competitive advantages. 
III. 
THE RESEARCH APPROACH 
In this section, we introduce the research approach and 
the study design of our work.  
The goal of this work is to understand the motivations for 
the adoption of FLOSS software. To avoid to bias the results, 
based on the results available in the literature, we decided to 
collect the motivations from scratch by means of a first 
round of interviews, and then a second run of interviews to 
analyze qualitative and quantitative results.  
This work has been composed by 3 empirical studies, as 
depicted in Figure 1: 1) Interviews 2) Focus group and 3) 
Group Interviews. 
 
 
The first round of interviews has been carried out by 
means of a questionnaire based on open-ended questions, so 
as to not drive the interviewee to a predefined set of answers. 
Then, the focus group has been designed to cluster the 
answers provided by the participants in smaller sets. Finally, 
the survey has been conducted by means of a second 
questionnaire, composed by closed-answer questions, based 
on the motivations group identified in the focus group. 
A. Interviews 
The goal of this study was to identify the motivations that 
influence the adoption of FLOSS.  
The interviews are addressed to assessing the current 
situation in the FLOSS adoption. The idea is to take a 
snapshot of the state-of-the-art in FLOSS motivation’s 
adoption according to developers, managers and custom 
integrators. For this reason, we designed a semi-structured 
interview with open-ended questions.  
Semi-structured interviews tend to be much more highly 
interactive and allow us to clarify questions for respondents 
and probe unexpected responses. Moreover, in order to 
collect a set of reliable answers, all interviews were carried 
out in person, by the same interviewer.  We believe this is 
the most effective way to elicit information and establish an 
effective communication channel with the interviewees.  
The semi-structured questionnaire was composed of three 
sections. After a brief first section, to profile the interviewee, 
and the company the interviewee belongs, we asked to list 
and rank the motivation for the adoption of FLOSS software, 
based on their importance, on a 0-to-10 scale, where 0 meant 
“totally irrelevant” and 10 meant “fundamental”. During the 
second section, the interviewer, also took note of the 
description of the motivation, so as to ease the clustering 
process to be carried out in the focus group. In the third 
section of the questionnaire, since we wanted to understand 
if the factors identified in [6] influence the adoption of 
FLOSS, the interviewer asked to rank the factors identified 
in [6], not listed as motivations during the second section of 
the questionnaire.  
B. Focus Group 
The focus group has been carried out to discuss the 
results of the interviews and draw qualitative conclusions on 
the results, summarizing and clustering the motivations. The 
clustering part is needed, since several users can define 
similar but not identical motivations.  
The focus group event has been planned to last three 
hours. We invited five participants; four researchers with 
experience in FLOSS quality, adoption models and FLOSS 
development and the author of the paper that acted as 
moderator.  
During the focus group we did not report the importance 
of each motivation to the participants, so as to avoid biased 
results by this value.  
Before the beginning of the focus group, we provided an 
overview of the objectives of the study, and described how 
participants should discuss and act during the session. Then, 
we presented the motivations elicited in the survey and we 
wrote them on a set of post-it notes. 
In order to better understand the difference among 
similar motivations, the moderator, who also carried out the 
interviews in person, reported the description of the 
motivation reported by the interviewees. Then, we asked the 
participant to organize the post-it notes on a white board 
using the affinity grouping technique[16].  
C. Group Interviews  
The final study has been designed to be executed in a 
group interview, with the support of a closed-ended 
questionnaire.  
In this case, the interviewer explained each question to 
the participants who answered to the questions on a paper-
based questionnaire. 
The interviewer distributed the questionnaires to the 
participants before the beginning of the workshop and then, 
Figure 1. The Study Process

after a short introduction of the motivation of the study, he 
asked to fill in the questionnaire, taking care that participants 
were not influenced in their answers from each other’s.  
We believe this method is more effective than online 
questionnaires, since participants have the possibility to 
make questions or to ask for more details.  
We organized the questions in the questionnaire in two 
sections, according to the types of information we sought to 
collect: 
• 
Personal information, and role in relation to 
FLOSS: helps to profile the interviewee and the 
company.  
• 
Motivations: here we asked to list and rank the 
motivation for the adoption of FLOSS software, 
based on their importance, on a 0-to-10 scale, 
where 0 meant “totally irrelevant” and 10 meant 
“fundamental”. 
The motivations included both the motivation identified 
in the interviews and the missing factors identified in [6]. 
Moreover, to improve the readability of the questionnaire, 
we grouped the motivations in five groups: License, 
Development process, Product quality issues, Customer 
requirements.  
IV. 
RESULTS  
Here we report the results of the three studies, together with 
a short discussion and interpretation.  
In order to answer to our research question, we first 
analyze the results of the group interviews and then we 
compare the results with those obtained in the first 
interviews after the clustering carried out in the focus group.  
Finally, we compare the list of motivations with the 
factors highlighted in our previous survey [6]. 
A. Interviews 
The sample of interviewees was not determined in 
advance. A preplanned sample would have allowed for a 
more controlled result analysis, but it would also have 
limited the possibility to add interviewees to the set in an 
unanticipated manner. We are fully aware that this may have 
somewhat influenced our results. 
Here we first provide information about the sample of 
respondents, which can be used to better interpret the results 
and then, we show the collected results with a concise 
analysis of the responses obtained, with insights gained by 
statistical analysis.

We interviewed a total of 38 participants. collecting 52 
different motivations with an average of 4.32 motivations 
listed per interviewee, a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 
motivations.  After a first screening on synonyms (eg.  
“Ethic” and “Ethical reasons”) we reduced the total number 
of motivations to 33.  
In Table III, we report the list of reasons together with their 
frequencies, ordered by #answers. Column Frequency % 
reports the answer’s frequency (#Answers/Total number of 
Answers). 
The first immediate result is that, compared to our 
previous survey [6], several new motivations have been 
identified while others are not considered. Unexpectedly, 
most of the development factors, license issues, and quality 
aspects such as complexity, performance and usability are 
not considered as good motivations for FLOSS adoption. 
 However, since several motivations identified in this 
first round of interviews are pretty similar, the identification 
of similarities and difference will be analyzed after the 
results of the focus group.  
B. Focus Group 
During the focus group we discussed how to cluster 
similar motivations, and how to compare them to those 
highlighted in our previous survey [6].  
The clustering, carried out with the affinity group 
technique, allowed to reduce the motivations to 21, on which 
13 are common with the factors identified in [6] and 8 are 
new: ethic, personal productivity, freedom, partnership, 
competitiveness, innovation, flexibility, project maturity.  
Table VI shows the list of motivations after the clustering 
process carried out, together with the results obtained in the 
next study. For reason of space, Table IV do not report the 
motivations not considered by our interviewees. 
Based on the clustering results, we were also able to 
calculate the ranking of each motivation reported in the 
interviews. For reason of space, we do not report the results 
but we only describe the differences with the results obtained 
in the group interviews, in the next section.  
C. Final Group Interviews 
As for the interviews, the sample of interviewees was not 
determined in advance. 
The survey has been executed during FOSDEM 2013 
workshop “An Interactive Survey on marketing and 
communication 
strategies”[14]. 
We 
distributed 
47 
questionnaires, obtaining 21 valid questionnaires.  
Participants 
were 
FLOSS 
experts, 
developers 
and 
practitioners. No students or non-experienced participants 
were considered in the analysis of the results. Table IV 
contains 
the 
distribution 
of 
companies 
where 
our 
interviewees belong while Table V shows the percentages of 
the roles for four organizational roles. Note that, in this case, 
roles are mutually exclusive, since we asked our 
interviewees to answer to the questions based on the selected 
position. 
Even if the sample was not determined in advance, the roles 
of our interviewees are well distributed among managers, 
developers and custom integrators, while no end-users filled 
in the questionnaire in this group.

A statistical analysis of the responses lets us partition the 
factors into importance groups, which we show in Table VI’s 
columns “entire dataset,” “managers”, “developers” and 
“customer integrators”.  
As for Table III, the column “Frequency %” reports the 
answer’s frequency (#Answers/Total number of Answers) 
while column “rank” report the weighted average of ranking, 
using the importance of each motivation as the weight while 
column “[6]” shows if the motivation has an higher or lower 
importance than the relative factor identified in [6]. 
Let’s first discuss the column “entire dataset, where we 
identified eight importance groups, from 1 (least important) 
to 8 (most important). The ordered grouping indicates a 
statistically 
significant 
importance 
ranking 
between 
motivations belonging to different groups, but no such 
ordering within each group. For instance, the motivation 
“customization easiness” belongs to group 8, so it’s ranked 
as more important than quality and just as important as 
“Economic” and “Personal Productivity” which are in group 
6. The number of groups depends on the portion of the 
population considered. For “Managers”, the statistical 
analysis led to nine groups while for “Developers and 
“Custom Integrators” to eight groups. 
The motivation “customization easiness” is considered, 
by all groups, as the most important driver for the adoption 
of FLOSS. Compared to our previous survey [6], this 
motivation gained several positions, moving from group 4 
(out of 8) to group 8.  
Ethical motivations, not included in [6], seems to be very 
important for our interviewees while the overall product 
quality is at the same level of personal productivity, and 
economic.  
Other motivations such as freedom, community support 
and potential partnership are relatively important (group 4) 
while all other motivation are definitely not relevant, lying in 
groups 1, 2 or 3.

When considering the different roles. few noticeable 
differences emerge.  
As expected, managers consider Economic of higher, but 
developers and Custom Integrators consider its importance 
substantially below average. Unexpectedly, managers have a 
different view of Ethic and personal productivity considering 
both motivations of little importance compared to the other 
groups. Moreover, managers are not interested to freedom at 
all.  
Custom integrators consider only a smaller set of 
motivations compared to the other groups, with quality, 
customization easiness, ethic and personal productivity as the 
most important motivations.  
Developers’ motivations are similar to the average. 
Merging the result of the first set of interviews with those 
obtained in the group interviews, we will obtain a final 
dataset composed by 59 participants (38 from the one-to-one 
interviews and 21 from the group-interviews).  
In this case, results do not change significantly, showing 
a similar trend as in Table VI. For reason of space, we report 
only the variations respect to the results presented in Table 
VI.  
The only differences are in three motivations where Ethic 
move down to group 5, personal productivity moves up to 
group 6 and community support moves up to group 5.  
We believe that this is due to the population of the 
interviewees, that in the interviews mainly belong to medium 
enterprises while in the group interviews to SMEs.  
V. 
RESULTS DISCUSSION 
The first immediate result of the study is that several 
development, economical and quality factors, usually 
considered important to evaluate a FLOSS product [6] are 
not considered as good motivations that drive the adoption of 
FLOSS.  
Our interviewees prefer FLOSS since they can easily 
customize it, without dealing with proprietary issues and 
being able to provide the higher value as possible to their 
customers.  
Ethical motivations gained a very high importance. We 
believe that this is due to the population of our interviewees, 
since we carried out the interviews during FOSDEM.  
As expected, quality and economic are always considered 
very important while new motivations as personal 
productivity. Freedom, potential partnerships are also 
considered as adoption key drivers.  
VI. 
THREATS TO VALIDITY  
Due to the number of subjects we were able to obtain 
necessary power for performed statistical tests. Before 
performing test preconditions (normality, independence of 
variables, etc.) were checked to make sure that they are 
satisfied. 
To get reliable measures questionnaires were checked by 
an expert on empirical studies. 
Subjects have similar background and knowledge about 
FLOSS. 
Although we ask the participant of the survey to provide 
individual answers, the results could be partially affected

since they were seated together in the same room. In the first 
two studies we employed only high skilled participants with 
a good experience on FLOSS while in the survey, we only 
analyzed the answers provided by experts. However, since 
we ran the survey during a FLOSS conference results could 
be biased in favor of FLOSS. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this work, we reported on a mixed research approach 
composed of three empirical studies, with the overall goal to 
characterize the motivations for the adoption of FLOSS 
products.  
We first provided an overview on the existing proposal 
and studies investigating the motivations, including our 
previous survey [6] where we analyzed the factors 
considered by the users when they need to compare two or 
more FLOSS products.  
Then, we conducted a first round of semi-structured 
interviews of 38 FLOSS users, so as to identify the high level 
motivations and to understand if the factors identified in [6] 
can also be considered motivations. Results of this first study 
show that most of the quality and economic factors are not 
driving the choice of FLOSS among proprietary software. 
The motivations were then clustered in groups, reducing the 
set to 21 motivations.  
Finally, we conducted a structured group interview, 
based on a closed-answer questionnaire, where we asked our 
interviewees to rank the motivations they consider key 
drivers for the FLOSS adoption.  
Results show that FLOSS users currently consider new 
motivations. Ease of customization is the most important 
motivator to adoption of a FLOSS product since it allows 
companies to better adapt the product to their customers.  
Ethics is also a very important motivation. Several users 
consider it more ethical to adopt FLOSS instead of 
proprietary software.  
Finally, quality, economic and personal productivity are 
also considered of middle importance with some variations 
in different groups. For instance, managers are most 
interested in economics, with less emphasis on ethics, as also 
confirmed by Gartner in [17], while customer integrators 
consider product quality as the most important motivation.  
Although we designed both studies to minimize threats to 
validity,  it was difficult to obtain good statistical 
significance for each group of users. We plan to replicate the 
study with a larger set of users so as to validate the results 
and to improve its statistical significance.
