Abstract—A great challenge nowadays is the systematic study 
on medicinal relevant functional (trans)membrane proteins 
reconstituted in tunable biomimetic model lipid membranes. 
Ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release channels (RyRs), integral 
membrane proteins present in various mammalian tissues, are 
of great importance for muscle contraction. For the present 
study, the RyR isoform 1 (RyR1) was isolated from the skeletal 
muscle of rabbits. Here, we show the reconstitution of RyR1 
into an artificial model lipid system, the so-called S-layer 
supported lipid membrane (SsLM). Bacterial crystalline 
surface layer (S-layer) proteins render the possibility to 
generate solid supported membranes of high longevity on 
various supports in order to enable investigations by a great 
variety 
of 
surface-sensitive 
techniques. 
According 
to 
preliminary results, RyR1 was successfully reconstituted into 
the SsLM as proven by quartz crystal microbalance with 
dissipation 
monitoring. 
Moreover, 
control 
experiments 
revealed that RyR1 did not stick to an S-layer lattice without 
an attached lipid membrane. Hence, evidence is provided that 
the SsLM as multifunctional interface might constitute a 
pharmaceutically interesting platform to investigate, e.g., the 
effect of a broad range of drugs on reconstituted RyR1 or 
other membrane proteins in general.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Membrane proteins are essential for life and offer various 
functions by serving as key components in inter- and 
intracellular communication. Therefore, they represent very 
attractive drug targets, but at the same time, studying 
membrane proteins and their pharmacological applications is 
a highly challenging task [1]. In an effort to develop 
synthetic membrane mimics of the natural cell membrane in 
both, structure and function, fabrication of a supported lipid 
bilayer on a solid substrate is receiving growing attention [2]. 
Solid supported lipid membranes are a well-known class of 
model membranes, extremely useful for studying biophysical 
and biochemical properties of biological membranes, their 
constituted lipids and in particular (trans)membrane proteins 
[2]-[4]. In order to design a synthetic lipid membrane that 
overcomes the challenges facing membrane-spanning protein 
reconstitution, a strategy based on surface (S-) layer proteins 
acting as biocompatible cushions separating the lipid bilayer 
from the solid support has been developed (Figure 1) [3][4]. 
The result of this approach based on the building principle of 
archaeal cell envelope structures are the so-called S-layer 
supported lipid membranes (SsLMs). The latter provide 
many advantages, e.g. reduces the non-specific binding of 
proteins to solid substrate, increase lipid membrane stability 
and longevity, provides a lubricant layer allowing the lipid 
bilayers to remain mobile, allows insertion of bulky 
transmembrane proteins into the lipid bilayer, and may assist 
self-healing of local defects in lipid bilayers deposited on 
large supports [3][4]. 
S-layer 
lattices 
are 
two-dimensional 
arrays 
of 
proteinaceous subunits which constitute the common surface 
structure of almost all archaea and most bacteria [3][5]. 
Bacterial S-layers have the unique property that, following 
disruption by chemical agents from cells, monomers of the 
protein can reassemble to their original lattice structure in 
suspension, on solid surfaces, at air–water interfaces, and on 
phospholipid mono- and bilayers. Most bacterial S-layer 
lattices are composed of a single protein or glycoprotein 
species having a center-to-center spacing of approximately 
5–30 nm, are 5 to 10 nm thick and show a smooth outer and 
a more corrugated inner surface (Figure 1). The lattices with 
a surface porosity ranging between 30–70% are composed of 
identical pores with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm [3]-[5]. 
One of the major advantages of planar supported lipid 
bilayer models is the wide range of surface-sensitive 
techniques, which can be applied to study the overall 
membrane characteristics and its constituents [2]. Quartz 
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D)

is one of these techniques, which allow real time quantitative 
measurements of the shift in frequency, which corresponds 
directly to the mass of bound material on the sensor surface 
including the associated liquid medium. Moreover, also the 
energy loss (dissipation) gives information related to changes 
of the viscoelastic properties of the deposited layer [6]. 
The present study is motivated by the high demand of 
studying responsive membrane proteins in a biomimetic 
environment. This intention is of paramount importance as 
the results of genome mapping showed that approximately 
one-third of all genes of an organism encode for membrane 
proteins, which are key factors in cell’s metabolism and thus, 
in health and disease. Moreover, membrane proteins 
constitute preferred targets for pharmaceuticals (at present 
more than 60% of all consumed drugs) [1].  
In the present study, RyR1 has been chosen to be 
reconstituted in SsLMs (Figure 1) since RyR1 is related to 
several severe human diseases, such as malignant 
hyperthermia, myocardial ischemia and central core disease 
[7][8]. The typical activator of the receptor is ryanodine, a 
plant alkaloid isolated from Ryania speciosa. It was soon 
discovered that ryanodine can cause muscles to contract or to 
reduce contractile force [8]. Experiments revealed that RyR1 
activation can be reversed to inhibition of Ca2+ release after 
prolonged incubation with ryanodine in the micro-molar 
range. In general, RyRs are modulated by endogenous as 
well as pharmacological effectors. Ca2+ represents the most 
important endogenous factor, whereby its release from the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is thought to be triggered by an 
action potential. As a result, the intracellular concentration of 
Ca2+ is increasing, which leads to the opening of other ion 
channels that are regulated by RyR1 and the subsequent 
release of Ca2+ from the SR [7]. 
To sum up, planar model lipid membranes, in particular 
SsLMs functionalized with pharmacologically relevant 
membrane proteins like the RyR1 may receive widespread 
recognition in drug discovery and protein–ligand screening. 
In future, the increased knowledge on membrane proteins 
will allow rebuilding sensory organs, e.g., an artificial nose, 
and are of high interest for the development of biosensors 
based on the function of membrane proteins [1]-[5]. 
In the following, Section II describes the S-layer protein 
isolation and modification, lipid membrane formation on the 
S-layer lattice, isolation of RyR1 and QCM-D measurements 
to provide evidence for the SsLM formation and RyR1 
incorporation. Section III A deals with the assembly of the 
SsLM, whereas Sections III B and III C report on the 
reconstitution of RyR1 in the SsLM out from proteo-
liposomes with and without CHAPS, respectively. Section 
III D shows that RyR1 cannot be attached to a plain S-layer 
lattice without any lipid membrane. Finally, Section IV gives 
a conclusion and outlook on the planned future work. 
II. 
METHODS 
Isolation of S-layer proteins The bacterial S-layer protein 
SbpA was isolated from Lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM 
2177 as previously described [9]. The protein solution (0.1 
mg/mL in recrystallization buffer: 0.5 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM 
CaCl2, pH 9) was self-assembled on gold substrates for 3 
hours. A subsequent rinsing step with water was applied in 
order to remove excess protein. 
Chemical activation of SbpA The S-layer protein was 
modified with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodi-
imide hydrochloride (EDC, Sigma-Aldrich; 15 mg/mL, pH 
4.5). Subsequently, vesicles containing 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine (DMPE) were bound via 
EDC coupling onto the activated SbpA lattice [10]. 
S-layer 
supported 
lipid 
membrane 
formation 
Phosphatidylcholine isolated from egg yolk (Egg PC) and 
DMPE were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The β-diketone 
ligand has been synthesized as described elsewhere [10]. 
Phospholipids with 1% β-diketone ligand were dissolved in 
chloroform and dried under vacuum for at least 3 hours at 
45°C. The lipid film was subsequently rehydrated and 
extruded 21 times through a polycarbonate membrane 
(Whatman, UK) by using a Mini Extruder (Avanti Polar 
Lipid Inc, USA) to form a suspension of large unilamellar 
vesicles (LUVs). Before use, LUVs were diluted in sucrose/ 
glucose (1/2) to give a final lipid concentration of 1 mg/mL. 
Isolation of the ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release channel 
RyR1 was isolated from heavy SR of rabbit skeletal muscle 
as described elsewhere [11]. RyR1 was provided in 
unilamellar proteoliposomes composed of α-phosphatidyl-
choline and approx. 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethyl-
ammonio]-1-propane sulfonate hydrate (CHAPS). The stock 
RyR1 concentration was 1.38 mg/mL, which was diluted 
1:50, 1:100 and 1:500 as indicated in each experiment.  
Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring 
(QCM-D) The QCM-D E4 device (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) 
was operated with gold-coated quartz crystal sensors (QSX 
301, Q-Sense AB) to measure the shift in frequency, ∆f, and 
dissipation, ∆D, as a function of time [6]. QCM-D 
experiments were measured at 25 ± 0.02°C. All given data 
were measured at the 5th overtone. The flow rate was 25 
μL/min for all fluid injections and rinsing steps. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Assembly of S-layer supported lipid membranes 
QCM-D was not only applied to follow SsLM formation, 
(i.e., recrystallization of S-layer proteins on gold sensor and 
successive formation of a lipid bilayer by binding and 
subsequent fusion of LUVs) but was also used to investigate 
the 
incorporation 
features 
of 
RyR1. 
Representative 
measurements of ∆f and ∆D in the course of the formation of 
the SsLM and interaction of the latter with RyR1 as a 
function of time are shown in Figure 2. In a first step, the 
assembly of S-layer proteins from solution on gold sensors 
was determined and showed a rapid decrease of ∆f to ~-75 
Hz and a slight increase of ∆D (<1×10-6) (Figure 2; Table 1). 
Both values recorded by QCM-D for S-layer proteins 
recrystallization on the gold sensor are in good agreement 
with previously published work [2][10][12]. 
Two obstacles face bilayer formation onto S-layer protein 
lattices; vesicle attachment and successive spontaneous 
vesicle fusion. The S-layer lattice has a so-called antifouling 
characteristic, meaning that nothing sticks to it and hence,

vesicles would simply roll over the proteinaceous lattice [3]. 
This intrinsic feature may be a biological function of the 
S-layer lattice covering many prokaryotic cells. Therefore, 
EDC was used to activate the carboxyl groups of the S-layer 
protein forming highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediates. 
Subsequently a solution of vesicles (LUVs) comprising of 
Egg PC, DMPE and β-diketone ligand was passed over the 
S-layer lattice [10]. This composition was chosen for several 
reasons: The Egg PC is the bulk component forming the 
spherical vesicle, DMPE as linker molecule is covalently 
bound with its terminal amino group to the activated S-layer 
protein, and the amphiphilic β-diketone ligand molecules 
incorporated in the LUVs master their fusion by the inter-
vesicular complex formation of two β-diketone ligands with 
one Eu3+-ion. The accompanied dramatic structural change 
of the lipid layer can nicely be investigated by QCM-D. 
Initially, the layer composed of bound vesicles gave rise to a 
huge decrease in ∆f (~-340 Hz) and increase in ∆D (~65 × 
10-6), corresponding to a very soft, highly water–containing 
vesicular layer. After Eu3+-ion triggered vesicle fusion, ∆f 
increased instantly to ~-100 Hz and ∆D decreased to 
~10×10-6 (Figure 2). The pronounced shift in ∆f and ∆D 
provide clear evidence for the change of the attached lipid 
structure. The obtained difference in ∆f between the S-layer 
lattice with and without an attached lipid membrane is 
approximately 22 Hz (Table 1). This value is in good 
agreement with the previously reported QCM-D response for 
bilayer lipid membrane formation [10][13]. In addition, the

TUTION USING DIALYZED (A) AND UNDIALYZED (B) PROTEOLIPOSOMES. 
 
same ∆D was previously reported for SsLMs [10]. 
Subsequently the lipid membranes were rinsed with 
recrystallization buffer to remove unbound excess material. 
B. Reconstitution of RyR1 via undialyzed proteoliposomes 
Addition of RyR1 proteoliposomes (1:100 dilution; 13.8 
μg/mL RyR1) causes a significant shift in ∆f indicating the 
attachment of RyR1 to the lipid membrane. Due to the 
moderate shift in ∆f and ∆D, an attachment of intact 
proteoliposomes can be excluded. The incorporation of 
RyR1 is evidenced by the fact that ∆f does not decrease after 
rinsing. The difference in ∆f in respect to the SsLM was 
determined to be ~33 Hz. This value is corresponding to a 
mass of 584.3 ng. Mean values of ∆f, ∆D, and changes in 
mass of repeated measurements are summarized in Table 1. 
Since proteoliposomes hosting RyR1 still contained CHAPS, 
it is not possible to determine the most probably small 
influence of the detergent on the bound mass. 
To investigate the influence of the RyR1 concentration 
on its incorporation into the SsLM, the experiment was 
repeated with a lower (1:500 dilution – 2.76 µg/mL) and a 
higher concentration (1:50 dilution – 27.6 μg/mL) of RyR1. 
For the 1:500 dilution ∆f was determined to be -19.5 Hz. 
Hence, the decrease in ∆f was slightly more than half of the 
value observed for the 1:100 dilution. Looking at the mass 
change, the attached mass was slightly higher (344.6 ng) 
than half of the mass determined for the 1:100 dilution. In 
contrast, ∆f was -30.1 Hz for the 1:50 dilution. Although the 
concentration of RyR1 was the double value than for the 
1:100 dilution, the decrease in ∆f was approximately 3 Hz 
lower. The calculated mass of incorporated RyR1 was even 
slightly lower (532.1 ng) despite the higher concentration. 
However, as RyR1 is very bulky (29 nm × 29 nm per RyR1 
complex [14]), there is a limitation in the number of 
incorporated RyR1 simply by the available membrane area, 
which is theoretically reached at the 1:100 dilution. 
C. Reconstitution of RyR1 via dialyzed proteoliposomes 
To investigate the influence of CHAPS on the 
incorporation of RyR1 into the SsLM, the experiment were 
repeated with the 1:100 dilution of dialyzed RyR1 
proteoliposomes (Figure 2). The shifts in ∆f after formation 
of an S-layer lattice and closed bilayer were equal to those 
observed in previous experiments. Table 1 shows that ∆f as 
well as the calculated mass for incorporated RyR1 is much 
lower for dialysis treated proteoliposomes than for the 
previous set of experiments without dialysis (275 ng vs. 584 
ng, respectively). This finding could be explained by the 
absence of CHAPS, which was still present in the undialyzed 
proteoliposomes. 
Another interesting result is the decrease in dissipation: 
In the experiment with undialyzed RyR1, ∆D between SsLM 
and incorporated RyR1 was determined to +0.91×10-6. In 
contrast to this value, the difference for dialyzed RyR1 has a 
negative value (-6×10-6; Table1). Hence, it is conceivable 
that the lipid membrane containing a detergent, which may 
induce defects in the lipid bilayer structure, behaves more

viscoelastic than the membrane purely comprised of 
phospholipid molecules.  
All experiments both, with dialyzed and undialyzed 
RyR1 proteoliposomes evidenced the incorporation of RyR1 
into solid SsLMs. The use of proteoliposomes lacking 
CHAPS gave a much lower value for mass change indicating 
that the presence of CHAPS facilitate the incorporation of 
RyR1 via proteoliposomes into the SsLM. Another 
explanation for the different results could be that the protein 
content was higher in the undialyzed assay, thereby resulting 
in a higher mass attached to the sensor (Table1). Finally, one 
cannot exclude that a certain part of the total mass 
determined by QCM-D has to be referred to the detergent 
CHAPS. 
D. Negative control 
All previously performed experiments provide evidence 
for the incorporation of RyR1 into SsLMs. To confirm that 
the receptor is not attached due to unspecific adsorption to 
the naked SbpA lattice, control experiments without previous 
formation of a lipid membrane were conducted. The 
attachment of RyR1 (13.8 μg/mL) directly on an S-layer 
lattice is clearly visible by the decrease in ∆f (data not 
shown). However, flushing of the system causes an increase 
in ∆f until the initial value for the SbpA lattice was reached. 
Thus, the whole mass assigned to RyR1 attached to the 
S-layer lattice was washed away. This result proves that 
RyR1 can successfully be reconstituted into an SsLM but it 
does not stick to a plain S-layer lattice on a sustained basis. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The preliminary data provide evidence, that the SsLM 
constitute a promising platform for studying transmembrane 
proteins in particular as RyR1 is a huge 2.3 MDa homo-
tetrameric, membrane-protruding complex [14]. Moreover, 
SsLMs do not get disintegrated by the presence of detergents 
like CHAPS. The future work will elucidate the orientation 
of the reconstituted RyR1 in the SsLM by binding of, e.g., 
fluorescently labelled ryanodine. Also replacement of the 
latter by natural ryanodine will give information on the 
correct folding of RyR1. Electrophysiological studies on the 
modulation of (single) ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release 
channel by effectors and drugs are the ultimate goal of this 
ongoing work. Finally, other receptor proteins, in particular 
the important class of G-protein coupled receptors will be 
functionally reconstituted and studied in the multifunctional 
interface of this robust platform. In this context it is 
interesting to note that recently a rapid technique for the 
sampling of membrane-associated proteins from the surface 
of a living cell and their subsequent deposition into SsLM 
has been achieved [15]. The future aims are the rebuilding of 
sensory organs like, e.g., artificial noses or tongues and the 
design of highly sensitive and specific biosensors based on 
arrays of responsive membrane proteins [16].
