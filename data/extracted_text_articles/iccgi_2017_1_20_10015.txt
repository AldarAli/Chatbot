Abstract—The aim of this work is an application of the 2D-
dynamic representation of DNA/RNA sequences for a description
of inﬂuenza viruses. The descriptors (numerical characteristics)
for the considered sequences are calculated. We expect that the
results will reveal some new features of the considered objects
and will be helpful for the creation of a model of time evolution
of inﬂuenza viruses.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, we have introduced and developed a new method
of comparison of Deoxyribonucleic acid/Ribonucleic acid
(DNA/RNA) sequences called by us 2D-dynamic represen-
tation of DNA/RNA sequences [1]–[5]. In the 2D-dynamic
representation, the DNA/RNA sequence is represented as a
set of material points in 2D space (”2D-dynamic graph”).The
distribution of the points in the plane and the way of calculat-
ing their masses is described in [1]. This method belongs to
a group of methods in bioinformatics known in the literature
as Graphical Representation Methods. They allow for both
graphical and numerical comparison of the objects. The ﬁrst
methods of this kind have been published in the eighties
and nineties [6]–[9]. Since then, many other approaches have
been constructed, as for example [10]–[13]. Reviews may be
found in [14] [15]. Each method describes different aspects of
similarity and still new approaches are constructed.

METHOD AND EXPECTED RESULTS
2D-dynamic representation is based on shifts in a two
dimensional space. The DNA/RNA sequence is represented
by material points with different masses in a two dimensional
space. This method is an improvement of traditional plots, in
which particular bases are represented by two orthogonal pairs
of colinear basis vectors. Such a choice of the vectors leads to
the possibility of shifts back and forth along the same trace.
The so called repetitive walks lead to degeneracy: different
sequences may be represented by the same graphs. In order
to remove the degeneracy, points with masses which are a
multiplicity of the unit mass have been introduced. After a
unit shift a point with unit mass is localized. If the ends of the
vectors during the shifts coincide, then the mass of this point
increases accordingly. The total mass of the graph (the sum of
all masses) is equal to the length of the sequence.
Several examples of the 2D-dynamic graphs representing
different complete genome sequences of Zika virus are shown

in Figures 1-2. Similar sequences are represented by similar
graphs. The structural forms of the graphs evolve with time.
Pairs of graphs are similar to each other: HQ234498 Uganda
1947 is similar to KF268948 Central African Republic 1976
(Fig. 1) and KJ776791 French Polynesia 2013 is similar to
KU365777 Brazil 2015 (Fig. 2). This observation is conﬁrmed
by the calculations done in [5].
Each graphical object is here described by a set of nu-
merical values called in the theory of molecular similarity
descriptors. We have shown that dynamical variables of the
classical mechanics as, for example, the coordinates of the
center of mass are the representative descriptors:
µx =
P
i mixi
P
i mi
,
µy =
P
i miyi
P
i mi
,
(1)
where xi, yi are the coordinates of mass mi assigned to the i-th
node of the 2D-dynamic graph. We have also used some other
descriptors, as for example the principal moments of inertia of
the graphs.
In the present work we apply these descriptors to a de-
scription of the sequences of inﬂuenza viruses. We hope to
discover some correlations between the descriptors and time
and place. The necessary data are freely accessible in database
Genbank. The mathematical description of these data will be
helpful for a general knowledge about the viruses and also for
a prediction of their evolution. This information is relevant for
the designing of the vaccine.
