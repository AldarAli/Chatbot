INTRODUCTIONS 
 In order to improve the automobile intelligence and 
security, 
contemporary 
cars have already gradually 
entered into active safety design 
from 
the past passive 
security settings. Now, except for the seat belts, airbags, 
bumpers and so on, we have to take active safety design into 
more consideration. The car can take the initiative to take 
measures to avoid accidents in advance. For example, the 
driver drowsy warning system, automobile anti-collision 
radar, GPS (Global Position System) system, tire pressure 
monitoring warning system, engine fire alarm prediction 
system, headlight automatic adjustment system, blind area 
monitoring system, vehicle information transmission system, 
automatic braking system, SOS parking system and 
automatic fire extinguishing system. All of these are to 
actively avoid a variety of accident factors that may be 
triggered by people or the vehicles. But studies into the 
various accident factors triggered by drivers is not a very 
active research topic; for example, traffic accidents caused 
by driver fatigue and cardiac sudden death is not uncommon, 
which contribute the appearance of driver on-site health 
monitoring mode that is based on the driver's physiological 
state detection. In recent years, the aging population is a 
growing trend and aging problems are spreading between car 
drivers who take a certain proportion of the underlying heart 
disease; when a sudden heart attack occurs when driving a 
vehicle, current active safety facilities cannot detect it 
timely, which creates an obvious danger [1-3]. 
     Some fundamental research about heart sound shows that 
heart sound can reflect the health status of different people 
[4-5]. When we make a combination of the existing driver 
fatigue detection system and automotive active safety 
systems, a more comprehensive unity of car reliability and 
security will be achieved. Therefore, the article analyzes the 
characteristics of heart sound signal and vehicle background 
noise firstly, and proposes the model of the heart sound in 
vehicle internal environment; according to the model, a kind 
of acquisition device is designed; then, it discusses the heart 
sound classification and identification method based on 
independent sub-band function, especially the rules and 
algorithms of independent sub-band function construction, as 
well as how to make independent sub-band function as a new 
statistics characteristic parameter.  
In order to quickly determine a heart sound signal, which 
is separated from the heart sound acquisition apparatus, the 
paper introduces the new concept, i.e., the degree of heart 
sound signal certainty. Finally, efficiency and feasibility are 
verified through the heart sound acquisition, classification 
and identification experiments.

CHARACTERISTICS OF HEART SOUND SIGNAL AND 
AUTOMOTIVE BACKGROUND NOISE 
The ventricular and the atria’s filling and contraction 
leads to heart beat, while heart beat information after 
cardiothoracic body reaches the surface and form the “heart 
sounds” that we can hear. Heart sound signals have the 
following main characteristics [5-6]: 
In most cases, we only can hear the first heart sounds s1 
and the second heart sounds s2; s1 is relatively low and long, 
lasting about 0.15s, while s2 is relatively high and short, 
lasting about 0.12s. Heart sound signals are mainly 
distributed in the first heart sound and second heart sound 
where a dominating place for us to extract heart sound 
parameters. However, the third heart sound and forth heart

sound are inconspicuous, so they are not underlined. 
Frequency of the heart sound is mainly concentrated on the 
range of frequency from 0~600Hz. Frequency of the first 
heart sound is between 50 and 150 Hz, while the second 
heart sound is concentrated in the range of 50 ~ 200 Hz. 
They have obvious change on amplitude while the other 
frequency range tends to zero. Figure 1 shows the heart 
sound signal spectrum. 
The heart sound signal is periodic, so we perform the 
analysis of the heart sound in one cycle. Although the 
waveform of each cycle is different and there are various 
interferences, we can still deal with the heart sound signal 
by regarding it as a repeated stable signal. 
Horn, the sound of a motor, brake sound, voice (audio), 
the wind, the sound of tire on the road and other noise are 
the main background noise in the automotive environment; 
in most cases, this noise can be divided into the interior 
noise and exterior noise. In this work, we focus on the 
interior noise. The typical car background noise has the 
following characteristics [1, 2]: 
    The sound of a motor, we also mean the sound of engine 
noise, which is one of the main sources of interior noise, 
typically 
including 
gasoline-combustion 
noise 
and 
mechanical vibration noise. When the car at low speed or go 
idling gasoline combustion noise is greater than the 
mechanical vibration noise, on the contrary, the later is 
greater than the former. Frequency of the engine noise is 
between 0 and 200 Hz, if the sound of a motor is smooth, 
there will a peak point in frequency 100HZ. Figure 1 (b) 
shows the frequency spectrum diagram of the motor sound. 
The car acceleration sound whose spectrum showed obvious 
ultra-low frequency and with a typical low-pass band 
spectrum, that is one special sound of a motor. Figure 1 (c) 
shows the acceleration sound spectrum. 
The voice is the sound of the voices of the passengers in 
the car or stereo, and it is an active interior noise, which was 
relevant with the occupant’s physiological characteristics, 
emotional and language content. Voice pitch frequency is a 
range of 130 Hz to 350Hz, while the harmonics of the 
frequency range up to 130 Hz to 4000 Hz, but the energy is 
mainly concentrated in the pitch range. Figure 1 (d) shows 
the sound spectrum; the music signal has a wider range of 
the spectrum and contains a richer, higher harmonic.  
The brakes sound is that when there is a car braking, 
brake pads hugging tire, tire and ground cause a dramatic 
friction, then, the tire will make a harsh braking sound; the 
faster, heavier quality of the car and the sharper the brakes, 
the louder the noise; sometimes, the brakes sound will be up 
to 70-90 dB. Figure 1 (e) shows the acceleration sound 
spectrum diagram, which is energy-frequency mainly 
concentrate between 0 Hz and 200Hz, but there are also 
obvious treble component; the brakes sound is an interior 
noise with wider spectrum. 
Horn, a peculiar language among car, people and vehicles 
to talk to each other, is indispensable in automotive safety 
systems. The horn is a steady-state signal with a good point 
and timbre; in addition, the baseband frequency of horn 
general around 400Hz and its spectrum showed baseband 
and several octaves, according to the spectrum. We cannot 
see significant fluctuation in the sound stage. Figure 1 (f) 
shows the spectrum of horn. The noise in the range of 0 to 
200Hz clearly coincides with the spectrum of the heart 
sound signal.

      characteristics of the interior noise 
III. 
A HEART SOUND ACQUISITION DEVICE FOR 
AUTOMOTIVE ACTIVE SAFETY 
In order to achieve real-time monitoring of cardiac health 
condition of the driver, the heart sound acquisition device 
was designed as an automobile active safety. The device 
configuration is installed on the car safety belt. The device 
not only can collect but also can finish the pretreatment of 
heart sound signal and classify the cardiac physiological 
state of the driver. According to such equipment, an alarm 
will alert when the physiological state of the heart is 
abnormal. Heart sound acquisition probe arrays are installed 
in the wall of a deformable elliptical acoustic cavity while 
the signal processing circuit, sound and light alarm were 
fixed at the top of the noise cavity; but what was configured 
in the cavity was an embedded lithium rectangular nylon 
sleeve, which cuffs can be installed on the car safety belt. 
Such kind of sleeves can be adjusted up and down along the 
seat belt position so effortlessly that it is possible to collect 
the heart sound signal without much effort. Recently, the 
device has applied for a Chinese invention patent, as shown 
in Figure 2.  
When the driver plugs the seat belt, the heart sound 
monitoring device will changed into working state; once the 
monitoring device does not detect heart sounds heart sounds, 
the light will shine, the driver is required along the seat belt 
up and down to adjust the position of the heart sound 
monitoring device in the chest; when heart sounds are 
detected, the light does not shine. The device provides real-
time monitoring of the cardiac physiological state of the 
driver; with this, we can make rapid analysis of the collected 
heart sound signals though the internal processor, or 
89

transmitted to the onboard computer processing. According 
to the classification of the heart sound, we can determine the 
health status of the driver. Once the abnormal sound is 
found, lights will flash, an audible alarm will appear and the 
abnormal sound signal will be transmitted to the automotive 
active safety systems for further processing. The device is 
not only used in lithium battery-powered, but also ultra-low-
power processor applied internally to improve working time 
of the signal acquisition. Once the seat belt is not properly 
plugged, the device will power off, reducing the power 
consumption.   
In order to improve the reliability of the classification and 
identification of heart sound signals, that means we need to 
eliminate automotive environmental noise to the greatest 
extent as well as the rapid and effective algorithm to 
correctly identify the classification of heart sounds.

HSSCD 
has 
quantitatively 
described 
the 
overall 
performance of closeness of a signal with standard heart 
sound signal in the amount of information and complexity. 
Figure 3 is time-domain waveform diagram of the heart 
sound signal and a variety of automotive background noise; 
Table 1 is a signal corresponding HSSCD value. 
We can have the following conclusions by the HSSCD 
analysis. 
Judgment 1: when HSSCD = 1, that is exactly the same 
two heart sound signals; 
Judgment 2: when HSSCD is approaching 1, indicating 
that the detection signal can be classified as a heart sound 
signal; 
Judgment 3: when the HSSCD value is smaller, it signals, 
does not belong to the heart sound signal. 
   Experiments show that HSSCD have little relationship 
with the signal change in sampling frequency and length, 
even if there is a difference in length and the sampling 
frequency of the two signals, HSSCD remains essentially 
unchanged.

HEART SOUND SIGNAL EXTRACTION METHODA KIND 
OF STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTIC PARAMETERS：THE 
HEART SOUND INDEPENDENT WAVELET FUNCTION 
    Feature Extraction of heart sound is to find a kind of 
transformation. This transformation can convert the original 
heart sound signal into a certain state of feature space, but 
also be able to save all the original information, so that to 
lay the foundation for the classification and identification of 
heart sounds. 
Feature Extraction of heart sound has many forms, such 
as a time-domain characteristics parameters extracted 
cardiac cycle, heart rate, and adjacent interval of the first 
heart sound and second heart sounds, Extracting the spectral 
characteristics of the heart sounds, linear predictive spectral 
coefficients, Mel frequency spectral coefficients [11] as the 
characteristic parameters of frequency. These characteristic 
values can be used for classification and identification of the 
heart sounds. According to the characteristics of the heart 
sounds, this article uses the heart sound independent wavelet 
function as a new kind of statistical characteristic. 
A. Description of independent sub-band function 
For one channel of the heart sound signal s(t), if we can 
brake it into q layers data segment Zq, with equal length 
(q=1,2, …Q), independent component analysis and signal 
divided into layers, by finding a full rank separation matrix, 
thereby defining the output signal [b1,b2,…bQ], including 
the information of heart sound signal s(t) as independent as 
possible, this group statistically independent function with 
each other in the time domain, which is what we call cluster 
of independent sub-wave function [5]. 
    The Independent sub-wave function is derived in the 
following way: (a) layers of the signal. This process can be 
understood as hierarchical linear transformation of the signal;  
(b) Analysis of the  independent components of the signal. 
The result of this process is hierarchical signal matrix 
solutions mixing matrix and the hierarchical signals are 
converted into mutually independent vectors matrix. This 
process can also be considered to be the projection of the 
vector direction independent of each of the sub-wave 
function. From more experiments, we draw more 
conclusions, as explained below: 
    The independent sub-wave function has strong local 
characteristics of the time domain, since the independent 
sub-wave function obtained by the different signals are 
varied, DFT (Discrete Fourier Transformation), DCT 
(Discrete Cosine Transformation) transform guide [9] to the 
base function to the various signals are very similar, showing 
obvious global characteristics in the time domain.  
    The independent sub-wave function has strong local 
characteristics of the frequency domain because the 
frequency characteristic curves of the different signals 
acquired independent sub- wave function are different. 
    These characteristics indicate that the independent sub-
wave functions can characterize on the signal not overlapped 
as a characteristic parameter, the identification and 
classification of the heart sounds may be used as an effective 
feature parameter. 
B. Algorithm realization of heart sound independent sub-

wave function are as follows:

    1) Stratify heart sound signal s(t). Signal layering is 
equivalent to a set of orthogonal base projection, and the 
hierarchical signal had orthogonally, using independent 
component analysis of the signal, while the length of each of 
the hierarchical signal should remain the same. Hierarchical 
method can meet these two conditions, such as wavelet 
hierarchical method, EMD (Empirical mode decomposition) 
hierarchical method; 
    2) Remove the mean, and preliminary bleach the stratified 
signal; 
3) Independent component analysis of the hierarchical 
signal after pretreatment, eventually to get heart sound 
independent sub-wave function cluster. 
 Figure 4 (a) is a single cycle of heart sound signal s, first 
use empirical mode of EMD decomposition t that broke s 
into a series of approximate simple component signal 
combination, that is:

Zl is the number one intrinsic mode function IMF, which 
is self-adaptive decomposition by the nature of the signal; r 
is the residual function of the average trend of the 
representative signal, λl is a coefficient, Figure 4 (b) is the 
result of empirical mode decomposition. Sk(t) will be 
merged into two groups hierarchical signals s11(t) and s12(t) 
with equal amplitude, as shown in Figure 4 (c); then we use 
fastica 
(fixed 
point 
iterative 
algorithm), 
Infomax 
(information maximization algorithm), and dwt_ica, three 
algorithms to process s11(t) and s12(t) statistically and 
independently , to obtain the heart sound independent sub-
wave, as shown in Figure 4 (d), (e), (f) below. We can see 
from the figure that the same sample points of independent 
heart sounds sub-wave as the source signal, but these three 
ways to get the heart sounds independent sub-waves are 
very different in magnitude. When using the dwt_ica 
algorithm, the independent heart sound sub-wave obtained 
is basically the same, however when obtained with fastica 
and infomax method, there is slightly different in the heart 
sound independent sub-wave b1f, b2f, b1i, b2i, especially, the 
infomax method has a significant uncertainty; its best result 
shows the effect can be better than dwt_ica, FastICA 
algorithm, but sometimes appears to be worse than those 
two methods. Cluster of independent sub-wave function 
shown in the picture is the average of the three test results. 
(Wherein the x-axis is the sample point, the y-axis is the 
amplitude.) 
Coefficient description of reconfiguration similarity: two 
heart sounds independent sub-wave similarity coefficients 
between the heart sound signals reconstructed with the 
original heart sound signal is the bigger the better; 
Irrelevancy describes with correlation coefficient r, which is 
the metric of independent heart sounds sub-wave of 
irrelevance degree, relevance between b1 and b2 is the 
smaller the better. Compare the data results shown in Table 
2; the value in the table is the average results of the three 
experiments. 
Using the data shown in the table, we can make a decision 
from the signal remodeling, the effect of the three algorithms 
are both good. Judging from the relevance of independent 
heart sounds wavelet, effects using fastica [9] or dwt_ica [9] 
algorithm are good, but the wavelet relevance obtained 
using infomax algorithm is significantly bigger. Analyzing 
from the time spent in computation, dwt_ica algorithm is the 
most efficient.  
In summary, dwt_ica algorithm shows obvious advantages 
in all aspects, so we will use dwt_ica algorithm to get the 
heart sound independent sub-wave function. A heart sound 
signal stratified results and three BSP algorithms of 
obtaining independent sub-wave function as shown in Figure

VII. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A.  The acquisition and separation of heart sounds 
In the vehicle initiative safety of heart sound acquisition 
device needs to set sampling frequency, channel parameters, 
etc. Frequency of the heart sound concentrates on the range 
of frequency from 10 to 400 Hz while heart murmur is 
below 1500 Hz. According to sampling law, we can avoid 
distortion when sampling rate is at least more than 3000 Hz. 
In the environment where vehicle noise is relatively large, 
we use 4 channels and 11025 Hz sampling rate. A group of 
acquisition results are shown in Figure 6(a). Then, 
according to the extraction method of heart sound signal 
stated in the section 3 and blind separation of four aliasing 
signal based on ICA [9], we can get four separation signal 
shown in Figure 6(b). 
In order to judge the heart sound and the vehicle 
background noise from the four separated signals, we 
analyze the sound signal with heart sound signal certainty 
(HSSCD), and discover that the HSSCD of separated signal 
1 is 0.9869, which is heart sound signal; the HSSCD of 
separated signal 2 is 0.4765, which is speech signal; the 
HSSCD of separated signal 3 is 0.3275, which is motor 
sound signal; and the HSSCD of separated signal 4 is 
0.4532, that is brake sound signal. Through sound 
transmitter, we can verify the conclusion. In fact, we just 
need to extract heart sound signal, and do not need to spend 
time on the other signals.

acquisition device 
B. The heart sound signal pretreatment 
The main task of the heart sound signal pretreatment is as 
follows [11]: (1) determine the beginning and the end point 
of the first heart sound and the second heart sound of each 
of the signal in a section of heart sound signal; (2) find out 
the beginning and end point in a periodic heart sound signal, 
and calculate the heart rate for displaying the characteristics 
of heart sounds better, highlighting the main component of 
heart sounds which are quite useful for the heart sounds 
identifying. Firstly, calculate the energy spectrum of the 
heart sound signal, namely separated signal 1 shown in 
Figure 7(a).  According to the envelope extraction method 
based on Hilbert transformation [5], we can extract heart 
sounds envelope, and the result is shown in Figure 7(b). 
Then, we can get normalization energy envelope shown in 
Figure 7(c) with the threshold taken from the average of the 
envelope. The optimized envelope can reflect the section of 
heart sound signal more accurately than the envelope 
directly obtained. Among them, every broader pulse 
respectively represents the first heart sound, and the 
narrower respectively stands for the second heart sound. 
Thus, we can easily calculate heart sounds interval and 
heartbeat. Lastly, we section heart sounds according to the 
period, and the result is shown in the Figure 7(d).

C. The classification identification of heart sound signals 
In the identification mode, the heart sound information 
in the database is a standard group. The database includes 
normal heart sounds (like the compare heart sound signal 1), 
and abnormal heart sounds (like the compare heart sound 
signal 2 which is premature beat heart sound, and the

compare heart sound signal 3 which is fibrillation heart 
sound). Take discretionarily a periodic heart sound signal 
from the signals in Figure 7(d) as the test group. They are 
shown in Figure 8(a). 
The standard group and the test group are required to 
use the same signal equipment and own the same 
magnification. They should not have saturated distortion 
(the best control is about the 70 ~ 80% of the maximum 
distortion amplitude). Then, we can extract heart sound 
wavelet function which is taken as a kind of statistical 
characteristic parameters from these data. Set the 
independent wavelet function of heart sound signal of the 
standard group as  
( )
i
c
b t   and the function of the identified 
heart sound signal as. Then, calculate their average 
similarity distance by the formula (13), which is 
respectively 0.0790, 0.6114, 0.8942. Choose directly the 
one which has the smallest similarity distance as the results 
of identification result, and this tested signal is the normal 
heart sound one. The similar phase diagram is shown in 
Figure 8(b). We can find out intuitively that the testing 
signal of classification recognition is most similar to the 
normal heart sound signal and the similar phase diagram is a 
thin oblique line of 45°. Several hundred classification 
identification experiments show that the same person's 
recognition rate at the same time is 100%, and the 
recognition rate at different time from the same person is up 
to 97%. For some specific person, the recognition rate is up 
to 99%, if we constantly update the normal database with 
the new acquisition of heart sounds. If we only classify heart 
sounds as normal heart sounds and abnormal, we would 
have a better classification recognition efficiency and effect. 
It basically reaches the level of practical application.

recognition of heart sound detection for vehicle active safety. 
Through the analysis of the main characteristics between 
heart sound signals and car background noise, designed in 
the car on the heart sound acquisition, separation, 
classification of soft and hardware scheme, compared 
fastica, dwt_ica, infomax three algorithms to obtain the 
effect of heart sound independent wave function, the 
dwt_ica algorithm the results of comprehensive evaluation 
is best, and discussed the heart sound signal model, noisy 
sound mixing signal separation model and heart sound

sounds determined (HSSCD). Similar distance mode 
matching method for heart sound independent characteristic 
parameters of the wave function and normalized envelope 
heart sound cycle segmentation technology, it reduced the 
calculation and increased the recognition rate, and it opens a 
new way for the practical application of heart sound 
identification.  
In the future, we will further improve the calculation 
speed and practical application.
