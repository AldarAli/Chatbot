Abstract
In wireless network, the communication works in half
duplex mode and nodes can interfere together. In this con-
text, fairness is not obvious. This paper will focus on fair-
ness in the received packets by each node. Fairness is eval-
uated for static networks topologies called Single Star Net-
work or Double Star Network. The fairness is quantiﬁed by
its index. In this work, the evaluation of fairness index for
double star network is given. Some value of this index are
not possible for double star network topology. For example
the index of one can only be possible if the double star net-
work is simular to star network. Then the star networks are
studied and some simulations are used to illustrate the way
to get fairness in the network by controlling the ﬂow rates.

Introduction
The performance of wireless 802.11 MAC protocol is
generally evaluated with two parameters : collision prob-
ability and fairness [1],[13]. The fairness algorithm was
widely studied by different research groups. Jain, Chiu and
Hawe give us a mathematical deﬁnition in [6]. Their pa-
per introduces the fairness index for any kind of resource
sharing. This deﬁnition will be applied to the packet rates
received by nodes.
TCP fairness was studied in [4], where the authors pro-
pose a distributed algorithm on neighbors to improve TCP
fairness.
In another paper [11] the authors propose a
scheduling algorithm to get fairness in a multi-hop wireless
network. Some papers are also based on the study of a dis-
tributed algorithm to maximalize throughput and fairness in
Ad Hoc networks [2],[3] .
This paper is focused in fairness on node reception rates
in an Ad-Hoc wireless network. A general introduction for
fairness and fairness index is given. After that, a description
of the network characteristic is done. For a theoretical anal-
ysis of the problem, the fairness index is evaluated for a ba-
sic network called Double Star Network and Star network.
The existence of some value of fairness index is proved. We
recall form [15] that exact fairness, such that fairness index
is one, is not possible until Double Star Network degener-
ates in a Single Star Network. The fairness of Star network
is studied and an algorithm is recalled from [14]. The sim-
ulation is done with NS2-2.33, will show that fairness can
be accomplished by limiting the transmission rate of some
nodes.

Network model and fairness
This work is done in the area of Ad-Hoc wireless net-
work. An Ad-Hoc network is made of wireless nodes which
establish wireless communications between themselves. In
this context, there is no central infrastructure. This means
that the nodes are equivalent. A node can be in two states
at a given time, transmission or reception. The limitation of
radio communications implies that the communications of
a channel are limited in distance and they act in half duplex
mode. These characteristics are described as follow :
2.1
Network model
We consider an Ad-Hoc network such as :
• The network is packet-switched
• The nodes are in half-duplex mode
• Only nodes in some distance can communicate
• The time is divided in time slots
• Packets are sent in time slots

2.2
Fairness index
In an Ad-Hoc network, the nodes have an equivalent role.
Because the communications are in half-duplex mode, the
position of the node in the network topology is dramatically
related to its transmission rate. Some nodes with high de-
grees of connectivity in transmission will interfere with a
high number of neighbors. This implies that the transmis-
sion and reception rates of the nodes are different.
In this paper, we try to give a fair access to each node.
Fairness can be expressed as a mathematical formula given
in [6]. The formula is based on a resource independent
model and can be used to express fairness for any shared
resource. It is also independent of network scalability. The
resource will be applied to the reception rate of each node.
We recall the fairness index deﬁnition form [6] :
Deﬁnition 2.1. The fairness index of a shared resource xi
is given by
f(xi) = (Pn
i=1 xi)2
n Pn
i=1 x2
i
(1)
We will apply this approach to the reception rate of a
node. Here are some of the notations :
Notation. The following notations will be used in this work
:
• Let xi be the reception rate of node Xi
• Let rj,i be the reception rate of node Xi of the packets
send by Xj
• Let Di be the degree of node Xi
• Let Si
j be the transmission rate of node Xj which is a
neighbor of node Xi
Remark 1. Using the previous notations, we have a recep-
tion rate xi of node Xi :
xi =
Di
X
j=1
rj,i
Node Xj has transmission rate Sj.
Therefore we have
rj,i = Si
j. This gives us :
xi =
Di
X
j=1

Double Star Network
Compute a fairness condition on reception rates is not
easy for some Ad-Hoc networks. From a theoretical ap-
proach, the star double network and star network are intro-
duced. This network is simple enough to compute a relation
on transmission rates to get fairness. It can represent a sub-
graph of an Ad-Hoc network composed of a central nodes
and its neighbors.
3.1
Deﬁnition
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Double Star network). The double star
network SNn,m is composed of n + m + 1 nodes
{X0, X1, . . . , Xn, Xn+1, ..Xn+m} where :
• {Xi, i
≤
n} are neighbors of the node X0,
{X0, Xi, n + 1 ≤ i ≤ n + m} are neighbors of the
node Xn
• and there is no connection between Xi, Xj for i, j > 0
only X0 is the neighbor of Xn.
This is an example :
X0
X5
X7
X8
X10
X11
X4
X6
X1
X2
X3
X9
Figure 1. The SN8,3 double star network
When the central nodes X0 or Xn sends a packets, it will
be received by their neighbors and this is not fair. Each set
of packets respectively sent by Xi where 0 < i < n+1 and
or by Xj where n < j < m+n+1 will be seen respectively
only once by X0 or Xn.
3.2
Fairness index of the double star net-
work
We can compute the fairness index for a double star net-
work :
Lemma 3.1. For a double star network SNn,m, the fairness
index α for the reception rate is given by the equation :
2 (2 − α(n + m + 1)) X2 − 2α(n + m + 1)Y 2+
Q(S0, Sn) = 0

where :

is a quadratique form where
A = −(n − 1)(n + m + 1)α((n + m + 1)α − n − 1)
(n + m + 1)α − 2
B = m(n − 1)(n + m + 1)α
α(n + m + 1) − 2
C = −(n + m + 1)2α2(2m − 3) − 2(n + m + 1)α(m2 − 2)
2(α(n + m + 1) − 2)
Proof. Let α be :
α = f(x)
some basic computation gives the equation (3).
The equation (3) might have no solutions.
Let’s see
which value α will give no trivial solutions. Equation (10)
is a quadratique relation in X and Y it has a constant term
Q(S0, Sn).
3.2.1
The coefﬁcients of X2 and Y 2
The coefﬁcient of Y 2 is −2α(n + m + 1) it is negative
because α is a fairness index and therefore α is positive.
The coefﬁcient of X2 is 2(2 − α(n + m + 1)). Its sign
depends on 2 − α(n + m + 1).
The following lemma gives some results about the exis-
tence of solution of (3) :
Lemma 3.2. For a double star network, the existence of
fairness index α is submit to the following rules :
• If
2
n+m+1 > α then there exits no trivial solutions for
equation (3).
• If α >
2
n+m+1 then there exists no trivial solutions for
equation (3) if Q(S0, Sn) > 0.
Proof. If
2
n+m+1 > α then the coefﬁcient of X2 and Y 2
have opposite sign. This implies the existence of solutions.
If α >
2
n+m+1 then the coefﬁcient of X2 and Y 2 have
same sign. To have no trivial solution, the quadratique form
Q(S0, Sn) has to be positive.
The lemma 3.2 shows the importance of the sign of the
quadratique form Q(S0, Sn) if α >
2
n+m+1. In the next
part, the sign of quadratique form will be studied.
3.2.2
The sign of the quadratique form Q(S0, Sn)
Recall that :
Q(S0, Sn) = AS2
0 + 2BS0Sn + CS2
n
(4)
In the lemma 3.2, the sign of the quadratique form
Q(S0, Sn) is important for α >
2
n+m+1. Let’s suppose
that (n + m + 1)α − 2 > 0, then the denominator of A, B
and C are positive. Let’s study their numerator :
• The sign of A is the sign of n + 1 − (n + m + 1)α.
• The sign of B is positive because n > 1.
• The sign of C is the sign of 2(m2 − 2) − (n + m +
1)α(2m − 3).
The next lemma will give conditions on n and m to have
A, B and C positive.
Lemma 3.3. If
2
n+m+1 < α and m ≥ 1 then
m2 − 2
2m − 3 ≥ 1
and C is positive if
2
m + n + 1 < α ≤
2(m2 − 2)
(n + m + 1)(2m − 3)
Proof. If α >
2
n+m+1
m2−2
2m−3 then C is negative else C is
positive. The sign of C is given by
2(m2 − 2) − (n + m + 1)α(2m − 3)
Let’s prove that :
2(m2 − 2) − (n + m + 1)α(2m − 3) < 0
This implies that :
2
n + m + 1
m2 − 2
2m − 3 < α
Lemma 3.4. A is positive if :
2
n + m + 1 < α ≤
n + 1
n + m + 1
Proof. The sign of A is given by :
n + 1 − (n + m + 1)α
The next theorem will give a condition for the quadra-
tique form Q(S0, Sn) to be positive.

theorem 3.1. If 1 < n ≤ m and
2
n + m + 1 < α ≤
n + 1
n + m + 1
then the quadratique form Q(S0, Sn) is positive.
Proof. B is positive, and because
2
n + m + 1 < α ≤
n + 1
n + m + 1
A is positive according to lemma 3.4. Recall the condition
for C to be positive given by lemma 3.3 :
2
m + n + 1 < α ≤
2(m2 − 2)
(n + m + 1)(2m − 3)
Let’s prove that :
n + 1
m + n + 1 ≤
2(m2 − 2)
(n + m + 1)(2m − 3)
if 1 ≤ m.
n + m + 1 is positive, this implies to prove :
n + 1 ≤ 2(m2 − 2)
2m − 3
Because n ≤ m we have n + 1 ≤ m + 1 Let’s prove that
n + 1 ≤ m + 1 ≤ 2(m2 − 2)
2m − 3
We suppose that 1 < m then 2m − 3 is positive and the
condition is equivalent to :
(m + 1)(2m − 3) ≤ 2(m2 − 2)
This is equivalent to
0 ≤ 2(m2 − 2) − (m + 1)(2m − 3) = m − 1
. This is true because 1 < m.
The theorem 3.1 and lemma 3.2 implie the following
corollary :
Corollary 3.1. If 1 < n ≤ m, then in a double star network
it is possible to get a fairness index α such that
α ≤
n + 1
n + m + 1
If n

1 then we set Y0

=
Xn+1, . . . , Yp−1
=
Xn+m,
Yp
=
X0, Yp+1
=
X1, . . . Yp+q = Xn−1 this gives a SNp,q double star net-
work with p = m + 1 and q = n − 1. Notice that p < q and
we prove the following corollary :
Corollary 3.2. If 1 < m < n then in a double star network
it is possible to get a fairness index α such that
α ≤
m + 2
n + m + 1
3.2.3
Maximal fairness index for double star network.
The corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 give a upper bound for the fair-
ness index of a double star network. This is shown in the
next lemma :
Lemma 3.5. Let α be a fairness index of a double star net-
work SNn,m which has no zero data rate reception.
• If 1 < n ≤ m then α ≤
n+1
n+m+1 exists
• If 1 < m < n then α ≤
m+2
n+m+1 exists
To validate the theoretical analysis, the next section will
present some simulations.
3.3
Double star network simulations
NS2-2.33 is used for the next simulations. CBR over
UDP trafﬁc is used. The nodes Xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and
Xj, n + 1 ≤ j ≤ n + m have a CBR rate of 0.5Mb. The
nodes X0 and Xn have a CBR rate going for 0.1Mbps to
1.0Mbps with a step of 0.5Mbps. The Ad-Hoc routing pro-
tocol DSDV is active. The CBR trafﬁc goes from X0 to
Xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, for Xn to Xj, n + 1 ≤ l ≤ n + m and
backwards.

In this case, n = 3, m = 8 and n < m. The lemma 3.5

If α will be greater than 1

the equation of an ellipse with variable X and Y . It will
be a very lucky to have X, Y on this ellipse. If the fairness

fairness index is greater as this values, say α = 1. The next
section will give an answer in this case.
3.4
Fairness for double star network.
A network is fair if the fairness index is 1. This was stud-
ied in the conference [15], and we recall the main results in
this section.
To be fair in a double star network, the fairness index of
the network must be 1. This implies the following lemma :
Lemma 3.6. A double star network SNn,m is fair if and
only if :
n (a − X − Y )2 + m (a + Y )2 + m(n − 1)a2 = 0
(5)
where
• a = S0 − Sn
• X = Pn−1
i=1 Si
• Y = Pn+m
i=n+1 Si
Proof. If the network is fair, the fairness index is
f(x) = 1
this gives :

By direct computation, we get the condition (5).
Remark 2. In equation (5), we can observe that all terms
are positive or null. This implies that each term has to be
zero for the relation to be validate. We have to discuss about
the value of n and m.
3.4.1
Case n ̸= 0, m = 0
If m = 0 and n ̸= 0, the relation (5) becomes :
n(a − X)2 = 0
(6)
This implies that a = X. This is the result given for a star
network in the paper [14].
3.4.2
Case n = 0, m ̸= 0
If n = 0 and m ̸= 0 the relation (5) becomes :
(a + Y )2 − a2 = 0
(7)
This implies that Y = 0 or Y = −2 ∗ a. Because n = 0 we
have a = 0 and then Y = 0. In this conﬁguration, no node
is transmitting.

3.4.3
Case n = 1, m ̸= 0
If n = 1, then X = 0, and the relation (5) becomes:
(a − Y )2 + m (a + Y )2 = 0
(8)
Because m ̸= 0, this implies that :
(
a − Y = 0
a + Y = 0
In this case, we get Y = 0 and a = 0. Then only X0 and
X1 are transmitting with the same rate S0.
3.4.4
Case n = 1, m = 0
If n = 1, then X = 0, and the relation (5) becomes:
(a − Y )2 = 0
(9)
This implies that Y = a, and then we get :
S0 =
m+1
X
i=1
Si
This is the result for the star network SNm+1.
3.4.5
Case n ̸= 0, n ̸= 1, m ̸= 0
In this case, the equation (5) has no coefﬁcient equal to zero.
Then every term should be equal to zero :





a − X − Y = 0
a + Y = 0
a = 0
The only solution is a = 0, X = 0, Y = 0 there is no packet
transmitted.
The next theorem was proved :
theorem 3.2. The fairness of packet transmitted in a
SNn,m double star network is given by:
• S0 = Pn
i=1 Si, if < m = 0 and n > 0 this is a SNn
star network,
• S1 = Pm+1
i=2 Si if n = 1 and m > 0, this is a SNm
star network,
If m > 0 and n > 1, then transmitting a packet broke the
fairness condition.
This theorem shows that exact fairness can’t exist in a
non degenerate double-star network. In the next section,
we recall the results for [14] whitch gives the results in the
degenerate case called star network.

Star Network
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Star network). The star network SNn
is composed of n + 1 nodes {X0, X1, . . . , Xn} where
{X1, . . . , Xn} are neighbors of the node X0, and there is
no connexion between Xi, Xj for i, j > 0.
The next graph shows a star network :

Figure 4. A star network
In this network, the central node X0 has a degree of n,
and each of its neighbors has a degree of 1. This is a very
unfair communication channel repartition. When the node
X0 sends a packet, it will be received by the n neighbors.
This packet will be seen n times in the network. On the
other hand, each packet send by Xi, i ≥ 1 will be seen
only once by X0. Intuitively, we see that to get fairness, the
transmission rate of X0 must balance the transmission rates
of all other nodes. This will be shown in the next section.
4.1
Fairness of the star network
We can compute the fairness conditions for a star net-
work :
Lemma 4.1. For a star network SNn, the fairness for the
reception rates hold only and only if :
S0 −

i=1
S0

Proof. Using the expression (2) of xi, the reception rate of

The relation gives a direct condition on transmission
rates to achieve fairness. It is much simpler to compare
transmission rates than to evaluate the fairness index. The
fairness index is based on a continuous function for trans-
mission rates. This implies that if the difference (10) is
close to zero, then the fairness index is close to 1. To get
a fair star network, the condition (10) must to move closer.
This remark lets us introduce a fairness algorithm which
will try to minimize the difference (10) to achieve fairness.
Remark 3. The star network is fair only and only if the
transmission rate S0 is the sum of the transmission rates of
all the neighbors of X0.
4.2
Fairness algorithm
An Ad-Hoc network is seen from a node Yi as a star net-
work SNd where d is the degree of the node Yi. Following
(3), we can imagine that the node Yi adjusts its transmis-
sion rate such that it corresponds to the sum of the reception
rates. It gets from its neighbors. This gives us the following
algorithm running on each node Yi and using a parameter s
given by the administrator of the network :

Figure 5. Algorithm

2. Compares the sum Ai to the node Yi transmission rate
Si.
3. If Si −Ai > s then reduce Si, if Sj becomes negative,
then set it to 0.
4. If Si − Ai < s then increase Si if it is possible.
5. If Sj = 0 for a long time, then increase it.
6. Go to step 1
This algorithm acts only on the transmission rates. It tries to
adjust the difference Si−Ai to be close to zero. To do this, it
needs to have some control over Si. For a star network, the
theoretical approach shows that minimizing the difference
Si − Ai will increase fairness. But it can also be used on
any Ad-Hoc networks.
The parameter s controls the sensibility of the algorithm
to the standard access algorithm. If s is null, the algorithm
will try to always get an exact fairness. This is not realistic,
and this can decrease the performance of the network. If
s is too high, then the algorithm will have no inﬂuence on
fairness.
4.3
Simulations
We use the network simulator ns2 to do the simulations.
The DSDV routing protocol is used. First, we will do the
simulation with the original ns2. After that, we modify ns2
to simulate our algorithm. The transmission rate will be
computed on TCP packets sent by each nodes. We use FTP
agent to simulate trafﬁc.
4.3.1
The star network SN6
We will now use SN6 star network for simulation where
two FTP connections (up and down) are established be-
tween X0 and Xi, i > 0. The following graph shows the

We notice that the difference (10) increases in time,
which is coherent with the fact that the fairness index is de-
creasing. The aim of our algorithm is to keep the difference
(10) close to zero.
We apply our algorithm to this network with s = 500.
To reduce Sj the algorithm changes the rate from 1Mb to
0.5Mb. When the delay becomes too long, the algorithm
reset the node in the standard rate.
This gives us the following graphs :

Remark that the fairness index goes to 0.43 which is bet-

Figure 9. Rate difference to fairness
We notice that the difference rate (10) goes from 15 to -
10 which is closer to zero. This improves the fairness index
from 0.41 to 0.43. The fairness index is still far from 1, but
we can expect that it will be better if the simulation time
goes to inﬁnity as described in the following ﬁgure.

The star network SN8
We will now use the SN8 star network for simulation where
two FTP connections (up and down) are established be-
tween X0 and Xi, i > 0. The following graph shows the

We can notice that the fairness index is around 0.432 at
time slot 500 and the difference (10) is around -14. This
conﬁrms that for the star network SN8, the behavior is not
fair. Now we will try to see what is happening with our al-
gorithm. The fairness index is shown in the following graph

This graph shows that the algorithm is working well. The
difference is less that -0.6 at time slot 500. The algorithm
seems to be efﬁcient.

In this example, the algorithm is applied to no star net-
work. The topology of the network is given by the graph

Conclusion
In this work, the study is focused on the fairness of the
reception rate. After some generalities, a double star net-
work and a single star network are introduced. This net-
work enables us to compute the fairness index. For double
star network, we give some upper bound on fairness index
to guaranty their existence. We prove that fairness can only
exist if double star network degenerates in star network.
Fairness is studied in star networks. Then we elaborate an
algorithm to get fairness. The algorithm needs only to know
the reception rate and the transmission rate of the node and
it can be used on every Ad-Hoc network. But in this case
the inﬂuence on the fairness index is not developed. Never
less and example are shown where the algorithm improves
fairness.
The simulation shows that the fairness index is improved
for a star network if we apply our algorithm. But the fair-
ness index doesn’t seem to react very efﬁciently. We can
expect better results if the simulation time goes to inﬁnity.
In some further work, we propose to apply our algorithm
to more complex networks to approach a general Ad-Hoc
network. A ﬁrst step is to compute the maximal fairness
index for some topology and then we expect to modify our
algorithm to reach this maximal fairness index for a more
general Ad-Hoc network.
