Abstract—Mach-Zehnder interferometric technology combined 
with optical fiber sensor allows the direct measurement of the 
impact response of a cantilever beam. The difference in the 
optical path due to the strain induces a relative phase shift in 
the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A 3 × 3 coupler is used to 
demodulate 
the 
phase 
shift 
of 
the 
Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer. Experimental results show that the optical 
fiber sensor is capable of measuring the dynamic strain of a 
cantilever beam impacted by a hammer. The impact responses 
measured by the optical fiber sensor are in good agreement 
with the strain gauge. The proposed optical fiber sensor is 
simple, inexpensive and easy to implement; moreover, it is 
highly reliable and accurate.

 INTRODUCTION 
Optical fiber sensors have attracted a great deal of 
attention in recent years due to their advantages over 
conventional sensors such as flexibility, embeddability, 
multiplexity, small size and immunity to electrical or 
magnetic interference. Optical fibers based on Fabry–P´erot 
interferometer (FFPI) have been utilized to measure 
electrical current [1] and the multiplexed interferometric 
current sensors have also been reported [2]. In this study, 
Mach-Zehnder optical fiber interferometric sensor is 
employed to measure the dynamic response of a cantilever 
beam subjected to impact. The method developed by Brown 
et al. [3] for demodulation of the phase shift is adopted. The 
demodulation scheme utilizes a 3 × 3 coupler to reconstruct 
the signal of interest. The experimental test results are 
validated with the strain gauge. In Section II, the Mach-
Zehnder interferometer is briefly described. In Section III, 
the methodology of phase shift demodulation is discussed. In 
Section IV, the experimental test results for a cantilever 
beam are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the 
proposed method. 
II. 
MACH-ZEHNDER INTERFEROMETER 
Mach-Zehnder interferometer consists of two 2 × 2 
couplers at the input and output. The excitation is applied to 
the sensing fiber, resulting in an optical path difference 
between the reference and sensing fibers. The light intensity 
of the output of Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be 
expressed as [4]:

system, the total optical phase shift 
  is proportional to the 
integral of the optical fiber strain. By measuring the total 
optical phase shift, the integral of the optical fiber strain can 
be easily obtained as follows:

× 2 coupler at the input and a 3 × 3 coupler at the output. The 
two outputs of the 1 × 2 coupler comprise the reference fiber 
and sensing fiber of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The 
sensing fiber is surface bonded onto the host structure. 
Mechanical or thermal loadings applied to the host structure, 
leads to an optical path difference between the two fibers. 
The difference in the optical path induces a relative phase 
shift in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The two optical 
signals are guided into two of the three inputs of a 3 × 3 
coupler, where they interfere with one another. The 
methodology developed by Brown et al. [3] for 
demodulation of the phase shift is adopted.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A cantilever beam impacted by a hammer is conducted in 
the experimental test. The beam of length L = 220 mm, 
width b = 20 mm, thickness h = 1 mm is made of copper 
with elastic modulus E = 120 GPa, density ρ = 8740 kg/m3. 
An optical fiber is surface bonded to the middle of the 
cantilever beam as the sensing fiber of the Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer. The bonding length is Lf = 60 mm in this 
work. A schematic drawing showing the cantilever beam 
with optical fiber sensor is presented in Figure 1. The 
material properties for the optical fiber are: elastic modulus 
Ef = 72 GPa, Poisson’s ratio vf = 0.17, index of refraction n0 
= 1.45, pockel’s constants p11 = 0.12, p12 = 0.27, radius rf = 
62.5 μm. An electric resistance strain gauge is adhered to the 
cantilever beam near the optical fiber. The optical fiber 
sensing system is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a 3 × 
3 coupler operating at the wavelength of λ = 1,547.28 nm. 
Figure 1 shows the signals of the three outputs of the 3 × 3 
coupler. Substituting the three output signals of the 3 × 3 
coupler as shown in Figure 2 into the Matlab software, 
performs the phase shift demodulation. The result of the 
demodulated phase shift is presented in Figure 3. 
Substituting the phase shift 
(t)
 from Figure 3 into (3), it 
leads to the determination of the dynamic strain of the 
cantilever beam. The dynamic strains obtained by the optical 
fiber sensor are compared with the results of the strain gauge 
as shown in Figure 4. Good agreement is achieved between 
these two sensors. The dynamic strain measured by the 
optical fiber sensor exhibits smooth and continuous 
oscillation, while a small perturbation and discontinuity 
appears at the peak of the oscillatory strain for the strain 
gauge. This demonstrates that the optical fiber sensor is more 
reliable and accurate compared with the strain gauge.

CONCLUSIONS 
The dynamic strain of a cantilever beam subjected to 
impact by a hammer is determined using the optical fiber 
sensor. Mach-Zehnder interferometric technique is employed 
to measure the impact response. The impact responses 
measured by the optical fiber sensor are validated with the 
strain gauge. Good agreement is achieved between these two 
sensors. The proposed optical fiber sensor is simple, 
inexpensive and easy to implement. Moreover, its capability 
of measuring the impact responses with high reliable and 
accurate results demonstrates the novelty of present study.
