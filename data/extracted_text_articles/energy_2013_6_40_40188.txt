Abstract— This paper presents a MIMO-OFDM based 
power line communication (PLC) system using space-
frequency coding (SFC), space-time coding (STC), and space-
time-frequency coding (STFC) over statistical indoor power 
line channels. We present a maximum ratio combining (MRC) 
scheme that provides both multiple antenna diversity gain and 
multipath fading diversity gain. By simulation, we verify that 
the proposed MRC is effective to both 22 MIMO and SISO 
over indoor power line channels. On the simulation, we 
consider both perfect and imperfect channel estimation. We 
also simulate SFC, STC, and STFC over power line channels, 
with or without crosstalk between antenna paths; STFC and 
STC are more robust to crosstalk than SFC; STFC with some 
added complexity overpowers the other coding schemes in 
terms of bit-error rate performance. Further, STFC is less 
sensitive to impulse noise index A than STC and SFC. 
Keywords— PLC; MIMO; OFDM; MRC; multipath fading; 
impulse noise; crosstalk.

INTRODUCTION 
Smart grid that is the renewable energy based future power 
line network will provide various kinds of power line access 
services (PAS). For that smart grid PAS, power line 
communication (PLC) that does not request a separate 
backbone network unlike other medium has become one of 
the 
main 
alternatives 
for 
high-speed 
bidirectional 
information exchange among electric power providers, 
electricity industries, and consumers. Moreover, since an 
international PLC standard, IEEE 1901 [1], was adopted in 
2010, there has been a growing interest in various other PLC 
applications including home networks and emergency 
backup networks. PLC is available at a low cost because it 
does not require any additional infrastructure; further, it is 
ubiquitous because it is available anywhere where there is 
electricity and is easy to access with a plug-in power cable.  
PLC that uses existing power lines, which are originally 
installed for power supply, has very poor channel 
environment such as limited carrier frequency (fc < 100MHz) 
by power cable attenuation, multipath fading, and impulse 
noise.  
The signal processing model of PLC multipath fading 
channel is classified into two types: deterministic-type [2] 
and statistical-type [3], [4]. In the case of deterministic-type, 
the well-known Zimmermann model has been widely used 
[2] but it does not consider practical channel statistics. Hence, 
there are several trials of statistical-type channel models, 
which are mostly modified versions of Zimmermann model, 
such as Galli model [3], and Tonello model [4]. Tonello 
model first takes the uniformly-distributed reflection factors 
in fading paths into account but it does not show any 
empirical justification yet (see [3]). Therefore, throughout 
this paper, we use the Galli’s statistical channel model to 
get the most realistic simulation results for our 22 
multiple-input 
multiple-output 
orthogonal 
frequency 
division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) PLC system. We also 
employ Middleton class A model [5] for the statistical 
impulse noise sample generation considering the impulse 
characteristics, which is raised by switching the power 
supply, the power converters, and so on.  
OFDM is widely used in power line channels since it is 
robust to inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the 
multipath fading delay spread [6]. In recent studies, MIMO 
using the spatial diversity, turbo coding, and low-density 
parity-check (LDPC) coding are actively investigated to 
reduce the transmit bit error rate (BER) and improve the 
performance of OFDM PLC systems [7], [8]. In this paper, 
via indoor power line, we implement the three different 
MIMO coding schemes: space-frequency coding (SFC) [8] 
using the frequency space diversity gain, space-time coding 
(STC) [8], [10] using the time space diversity gain, and 
space-time-frequency coding (STFC) [8] using the time and 
frequency space diversity gain.  
By 
simulation, 
we 
evaluate 
and 
compare 
SFC/STC/STFC based 22 MIMO-OFDM PLC systems 
with the proposed maximum ratio combing (MRC) scheme 
over statistical PLC channels. Whereas conventional MIMO-
OFDM PLC [6], [8] just considers antenna MRC (AMRC) to

obtain spatial diversity gain, the presented MIMO-OFDM 
PLC employs antenna & fading MRC (AFMRC, also called 
rake receiver) that effectively combines both multiple 
antenna (in PLC, a pair of power line conductors forms one 
antenna port) and multipath fading diversity gain. 
Conventional MIMO PLC in [8] assumes the ideal antenna 
paths with no crosstalk, but the proposed MIMO PLC 
takes crosstalk between antenna paths into consideration.  
In this paper, for the theory and analysis of the 
proposed MIMO-OFDM system model, we consider both 
perfect channel estimation and imperfect channel 
estimation. For the simulation of imperfect channel 
estimation, we employ a least square estimator (see [9]), 
which is a simple but well-established channel estimator. 
Simulation results verify that the presented MRC 
scheme is superior to the conventional scheme, whether 
or not crosstalk between antenna channels exists. This 
scheme improves the BER performance, not only in the 
22 MIMO, but also in the single-input single-output 
(SISO); note that SISO just uses fading MRC (FMRC) 
rather than AMRC. In simulation, we also evaluate the 
proposed MIMO PLC when the impulse noise index A 
and the ratio of impulse to Gaussian noise variance  vary. 
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 
 
Propose a SISO-/MIMO-OFDM PLC using a rake 
receiver; 
 
Fully evaluate the proposed system over statistical 
power line channels with fading, impulse noise, 
crosstalk between antenna paths; 
 
Analyze the proposed system with both perfect and 
imperfect channel estimator. 
Section II describes the proposed system model 
including PLC channel characteristics, crosstalk in MIMO 
channels, SFC/STC/STFC based MIMO-OFDM, and least 
square channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM. Section III 
details simulation results of the proposed system and finally, 
Section IV concludes the paper.  
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
A. Impulse Noise and Fading Channel in PLC 
A PLC channel can be characterized with both impulse 
noise and multipath fading, due to multiple signal reflections 
caused by power line impedance mismatch. First, for 
impulse noise, we use Middleton class A model [5], which  
pdf (probability density function) is defined as:

Second, in a PLC channel, there are two types of channel 
models; deterministic-one like Zimmermann model [2], and 
statistical-one like Galli model [3]. First, the transfer

Typically, each OFDM subcarrier has flat (constant) 
frequency channel characteristics due to its narrow 
bandwidth such that the frequency selective fading channel 
transfer function of (3) can be translated (digitized) and

is the subcarrier spacing, and k (= 0, 1, …, N – 1, where N is 
the number of subcarriers) is the frequency index. For the 
time being, operating under the assumption that a good 
channel estimator, such as a least square method [9] or a 
pilot assisted method [10], is employed, we assume the ideal

dealt with using a cyclic prefix (CP) of OFDM system, the 
proposed system model just considers the average channel 
gain at the jth antenna path and lth fading path, defined as

B. Crosstalk in MIMO channels 
In MIMO channels, there exists crosstalk between 
antenna paths; note that each antenna path in a MIMO PLC 
system is formed with a pair of power line conductors. This 
crosstalk may cause the capacity loss of the MIMO PLC 
system such that it is not negligible, especially for fc  25 
MHz [6]. The 22 MIMO channel matrix H(k) with non-
zero crosstalk terms, indicating the ith transmit jth receive 
antenna path gain

C. SFC/STC/STFC based MIMO-OFDM PLC System 
We implement a SFC/STC/STFC based 22 MIMO-
OFDM PLC system. In a MIMO PLC system, since a pair of 
electrical wires is converted into a single antenna channel, 
the number of transmitting and receiving antennas is 
typically limited to one for 1-phase 2-wire and two for 1-
phase 3-wire (including one wire for common ground (or 
protective earth)). Therefore, MIMO-OFDM is used with a 
1-phase 3-wire power line, whereas SISO-OFDM is mostly 
used with a 1-phase 2-wire power line. This 22 MIMO 
system has two antenna paths that consist of a single antenna 
path formed with two wires and another antenna path made 
of other two wires. 
In the OFDM transmitter, the kth (= 0, 1, …, N-1) 
subcarrier modulation signal, S(k), experiences the following 
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT):

where s(n) is the nth (= 0, 1, …, N-1) time sample and N is 
the number of subcarriers. 
First, in the case of a SFC based 22 MIMO, whose 
encoder diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a), we can obtain the 
spatial and frequency diversity which is used to reduce the 
error probability caused by the interference in the MIMO 
channel.

corresponding time sample vectors, s=IFFT{S} and 
s =IFFT{S }, through the IFFT process (see (11)) and then 
transmitted to the receiver via each antenna path. The cyclic 
prefix (CP) is added to the OFDM modulated sample vectors 
( s , s ) before their transmission, in order to prevent inter-
symbol interference (ISI) due to the maximum delay spread

 This transmission process occurs at the 
modulator and SFC encoder, and its corresponding reception 
process takes place at the SFC decoder and demodulator [11]. 
The received signal via the power line channel goes through 
the SFC decoding process at the SFC receiver, including the 
fast Fourier transformation (FFT) (OFDM demodulation)

and MRC process, to recover its data stream after removing 
the added CP. 
Whereas conventional MIMO schemes in [8] use AMRC 
to achieve diversity gain by multiplying their optimum 
weights to different antenna paths, the proposed MIMO 
system employs AFMRC (also called rake receiver), a 
combined technique of AMRC and FMRC. The used scheme 
has one finger (one receiver) for each fading path to achieve 
the FMRC gain. The receiver complexity of the AFMRC 
based MIMO increases L-fold as a result of adding FMRC. 
At the receiver, the received signal via the jth (=1, 2) receive 
antenna lth (=1, 2, …, L) fading path after the FFT process 
(which is the reverse process of the IFFT in (11)) is given as

Before the jth antenna received signals in (15) are added

the circular-shifted process in (12) and (13). Hence, by the

Second, in the case of a STC based 22 MIMO, whose 
encoder diagram is shown in Fig. 1(b), we can obtain the 
spatial and temporal diversity to improve the system 
performance. The two transmission vectors in this STC 
transmitter, S1 = { S1(k) | k = 0,1, …, N - 1} and S2 = { S2(k) | 
k = 0,1, …, N - 1} are independent each other and ()* refers 
to the conjugate of (). In Fig. 1(b), we observe that at time t, 
S1

respectively, and at time t+T (where T is the OFDM symbol

Third, in the case of STFC based 22 MIMO, it extends 
the signal space of STC to the frequency axis such that we 
can achieve the frequency diversity besides the spatial and 
temporal diversity; its encoder has a serially-combined 
structure of SFC and STC [8], as shown in Fig. 1(c). In the 
STFC transmitter, the input of STC is the two output vectors 
of SFC encoder, i.e., S  and S  (see (12) and (13)).

performed after the FFT operation at the receiver. For the 
channel estimation, the pilot signals which are already 
known at the receiver are used. In the OFDM system, 
adjacent G subcarriers are grouped without overlapping. In 
this paper, we assume that each group has almost the same 
channel. In each group, the first subcarrier is the pilot 
subcarrier. Therefore, the total M (= N/G) pilot subcarriers 
are used for channel estimation. In [9], they assume that all 
the pilot signals have an equal complex value c. The 
transmitted signals on the kth subcarrier are expressed as

In (28), N′(mG)/c is a noise plus crosstalk component 
of the estimated channel. The estimated channel will 
have a large value of this component when the signal to 
noise ratio is small. 22 MIMO using SFC or STC has 
twice as many noise component than SISO when the 
signals from the two antenna paths are combined (STFC 
has twice more noise component compared to SFT or 
STC). The affection of this noise component is shown in 
simulation results.  
III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
We simulate the proposed system model with the QPSK 
constellation under power line channel conditions. The 
simulation assumes a PLC multipath fading channel with 
L=6, e.g., whose parameters in Zimmermann model are 
shown in Table I of [8]. For simplicity, we also assume the 
same fading channel parameters for the two antenna paths  
in the case of PLC channels using indoor power lines; the 
changing of channel parameters between the antenna paths is 
almost negligible in practice [7]. We set N = 1024 (in the 
case of STFC, N equals 2048 for the same data rate), the CP 
size = 120 (unit: samples), fc = 30 MHz, f (frequency 
spacing) = 10 KHz, and BW = 10.24 MHz for the simulation; 
hence the maximum data rate is approximately 18.3 Mbps. 
Fig. 2 compares the BER performance between 
conventional MRC method and the proposed MRC method 
on SISO-/MIMO-OFDM system. First, in the case of MIMO-
OFDM system using 22 SFC or 22 STC, the proposed 
MRC (AFMRC) obtains the performance gain of about 2dB  
at 10-4 BER compared to conventional MRC (AMRC). 
Second, in the case of MIMO using 22 STFC, AFMRC 
provides the 2dB gain at BER=10-4 compared to AMRC. Fig. 
2 also compares conventional method (with no MRC) and the 
suggested method (with FMRC) on SISO-OFDM system. For 
SISO with FMRC, we can get approximately 2dB gain at 
BER=10-4 compared to SISO with no MRC. Therefore, 
FMRC for SISO system and AFMRC for MIMO system are 
more effective according to these simulation results. It also 
verifies that AFMRC is similarly effective at MIMO systems 
using SFC, STC, or STFC.

Fig. 3 compares the BER performance of 22 STC, 22 
SFC, and 22 STFC based MIMO-OFDM PLC when the 
crosstalk between antenna channels exists. Assume that 
AFMRC is applied to all these MIMO coding schemes. We 
can observe that as the crosstalk ratio (CR) increases, STC 
has a relatively reduced BER compared to SFC. Especially, 
for CR > 10%, the relative performance gain difference 
between STC and SFC becomes greater. It indicates that STC 
is less sensitive to crosstalk than SFC. In Fig. 3, we can find 
out that STFC has a similar tendency as STC. It looks that as 
CR increases the STFC (STC as well) performance is 
degraded linearly while the SFC performance is degraded 
exponentially; specifically, for the 10% increase of CR, the 
coding gain of STFC degrades 1.5dB (similar in STC) in the 
average sense while that of SFC degrades 1.2dB for the 
increment of CR 0% to 10% and 2.2dB for CR=10% to 20%, 
and 3.5dB for CR=20% to 30%. Therefore, STC and STFC 
have robustness to crosstalk and STFC with additional 
complexity improves the BER performance of STC further. 
In Fig. 4, we evaluate the BER performance of SISO-
OFDM PLC and STC-based 22 MIMO-OFDM PLC using 
least square channel estimation methods with different 
number of pilot subcarriers. Fig. 4 shows that BER decreases 
as the number of pilot subcarriers increases. It confirms that if 
we have a larger number of pilot subcarriers, we can estimate 
the channel more exactly (since the noise component in (28) 
becomes smaller). Fig. 4 also shows that the BER curve is 
going to approach to the ideal case as Eb/N0 [dB] increases. In 
the case of MIMO PLC, the ideal channel estimator has 0.5dB 
gain at the BER=10-2 compared to the least square channel 
estimator with M=32 pilot subcarriers. However, at the 
BER=10-4, the gain difference between those two schemes 
reduces (about 0.1 to 0.2dB); for the larger M, that difference 
gets smaller. In the case of SISO, we can observe the similar 
tendency of BER curves as in MIMO.  
However, in Fig. 4, we can observe that SISO improves 
the BER performance a little bit compared to STC-based 
MIMO, since the latter requests two times more noise 
component than the former. SFC-based MIMO shows the 
similar performance results (even their results are not 
included here due to the space limit). 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a MIMO-OFDM based PLC using 
AFMRC. We compared SFC, STF, and STFC based 
MIMO-OFDM over statistical indoor power line channels, 
with or without crosstalk between antenna paths. By 
computer simulation, we verified that the proposed MRC 
scheme is effective to both SISO PLC and MIMO PLC 
applications. It is shown that STC and STFC are more 
robust to crosstalk than SFC; STFC with additional 
complexity overpowers STC and SFC in terms of BER over 
power line channels. Further, we also simulated the 
proposed MIMO model with imperfect channel estimation.
