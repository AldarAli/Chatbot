Abstract— The paper focuses on creating of a software 
reliability model based on phase type distribution. Usually, the 
length of intervals between the moments of fault detection and 
correction have unknown distributions. In this paper, a new 
approach how to approximate any distribution of positive 
random variable by mixture and convolution of exponential 
phases, known as the general type of phase-type distribution, is 
proposed. The optimization algorithm of Local Unimodal 
Sampling (LUS) is applied to estimate parameters of phase-
type distribution. After such procedure, the dynamics of a 
software reliability model can be described by a continuous 
time absorbing Markov chain. The probabilities of the 
resulting absorbing Markov chain are used to compute 
performance measures of the software reliability model. 
Keywords-software reliability model; phase–type distribution; 
absorbing Markov chain; performance measures. 
 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Software reliability is the failure probability of the 
software under investigation. The situation on creating 
software reliability models is clearly explained in the 
following citation from the Wikipedia: “Over 225 models 
have been developed since early 1970s, but how to quantify 
reliability still remains unsolved. There is no single model 
which can be used in every situation. There is no model 
which is either complete or fully developed” [1]. 
A software reliability model allows forecasting the  
software reliability at any moment of time. One of the 
important problems in creating models is an assumption 
about distribution of the length of intervals between the 
moments of fault detection. Some of authors assumes that 
the length of intervals is distributed according to the 
exponential law [2][3]. For example, the model developed by 
Moranda and Jelinski [4] assumes an exponential time 
between failures having parameter that time intervals of 
detection software faults follow exponential law with the 
parameter proportional to the number of faults remaining in 
the system. The similar assumptions are used in [5][6]. 
Recently, non-homogenous Poisson processes became 
popular for describing stochastic behavior of the number of 
detected faults, because of their simplicity [7][8][9]. Beside 
the mentioned distributions, other models that are based on 
Weibull [10], hyper geometric [11], Pareto [12] and other 
distributions [13] are investigated. 
The use in the software reliability model of any non-
exponential distributions is complicated from the computing 
point of view. Therefore, in this paper, a novel approach to 
apply a convolution and mixture of exponential distributions, 
called the Phase-Type (PH) distribution, to approximate time 
distributions of fault detection and fixing is suggested. It is 
known that the PH distribution can approximate an arbitrary 
probability distribution of a positive random variable with an 
arbitrary accuracy by adjusting the phase structure [14]. 
Some authors use concrete structure of PH distributions, 
such as Erlang and hyper exponential [15], Cox [16], or 
others. The concrete structure of the PH distribution may not 
approximate the desired distribution with the required 
accuracy. Many models have been utilised for evaluating  the 
quality of a software using reliability but very little focus on 
general type of three phase  distribution. Hence, this paper 
mainly focuses on this direction. Using such distribution, the 
performance of the model can be described by an absorbing 
Markov chain [14]. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II gives 
description of software reliability model under consideration. 
Section III describes the algorithm for finding the structure 
and parameters of approximating PH distribution. The 
algorithm for constructing the set of all possible states of the 
system and transition matrix between states is given in 
Section IV. The modelling results are presented in Section V. 
The paper is concluded in Section VI.

DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL 
Let us describe the conceptual model of a software 
reliability model. Say, that the software contains a fixed 
number of faults Fc (fault count). Assume that the fault 
detection time follows some distribution  and fixing 
time of detected faults obeys another distribution law 
. The modelling process can be represented as the 
queuing system (see Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1. The process of identifying and fixing faults in software. 
It is proposed to approximate any general distribution of 
a positive random variable by the general phase-type 
distribution (GPH). The phase-type (PH) distribution is 
defined as the absorbing time distribution of Continuous-
Time Markov Chain (CTMC). The detected fault enters the

queue if the previously detected one is not fixed yet. The 
process of detecting and fixing faults ends when all the faults 
are identified and fixed. The developed software reliability 
model gives probabilistic measures of the process.

PARAMETER  ESTIMATION OF THE PHASE-TYPE 
DISTRIBUTIONS 
Parameter estimation of general phase-type distribution is 
one of the most challenging problems. 
The precision of approximation of non-markovian model 
 by markovian one ∗ depends on how well distributions 
 ,  are approximated by phase-type distributions 
	
, 	
 . There are several methods to search for 
optimal 
phase-type 
distribution 
parameters: 
moment 
matching method [17][18], expectation maximization 
method [19][20][21][22], and others. We will search for the 
optimal parameters by employing a vector optimization 
algorithm.

unit of time. The auxiliary vector   , ,  :  

The algorithm for constructing the set of states and the 
transition matrix for markovian model ∗ is described in 
this section. The set of states of the system is defined by  the 
vector c  S, S, S, S8, where S ∈ d1,2,3e denotes the 
index of an active phase of 	
 and S  0 indicates that 
there is any active phase in 	
; S ∈ d0,1, … , f  1e 
denotes a number of detected faults which are waiting in the 
queue; S ∈ d1,2,3e denotes the index of an active phase of  
	
, S  0 indicates that there is any active phase in 
	
;S8 ∈ d0,1, … , fe – denotes a number of fixed faults. 
The number of detected faults in the state c  is defined 
according the formula  
 
fc  !dQ4g>e % S % !dQ6g>e % S8. 
(8) 
 
All the states are enumerated by the mapping  
 
h   ic ∈ d0,1, … , jb3  1e,

where 
jb3
 denotes 
the 
number

ic  f % 14Sf % 4S % S % S8.

The inverse mapping imh is obtained by the formulas

The vector *  nw>, w, … , wxyz{mr of boolean variables 
(false or true) are used to determine all the possible states of 
the system. The following sets of states are used: |M} 
contains initial states of the system; | contains all possible 
states of the system; |M~ includes states which are going to 
be investigated in the next iteration and |}b~  is the 
temporary set of states obtained from the investigated states 
after one iteration. Each state contained in these sets is 
represented by its index  h. 
The transitions rates between all states are stored in the 
matrix 7  
7;  ,   0, jb3  1.  
The algorithm for generating the set of possible states of 
the system consists of the following   steps:

the

     Clear the temporary set |}b~ ≔ ∅ 
 
     Let d|M~e~ be an -th element of the set |M~. 
 ≔ 1 
6) Find the coordinates of the state vector to be 
investigated: 
 
c ≔ imnd|M~e~r, h:  ic 
 
7) Let us denote the set of the state vectors, that can 
be reached from the state  c, by |∗ ≔ ∅ and the 
set of transition rates, at which all states in set 
|∗ are reached from the  state c, by λ∗  ∅. 
 
8) Find 
the

of 
the 
sets

The explanation of the step 8 in detail follows. 
Denote by the vector c = S, S, S, S8 the state of the 
system. There are four events that make the system to 
change the state: e1 – the change of an active phase in 
	
, e2 – the detection of fault, e3 – the change of an 
active phase in 	
 and e4 – the correction of fault. The

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this article, a continuous time absorbing Markov chain 
model of software reliability was proposed. Non-markovian 
distributions of the length of intervals between the moments 
of fault detection and correction are approximated by the 
general phase-type distributions with three phases. The 
model generalizes other software reliability models in which 
various types of distributions are used. The probabilistic 
measures of detecting and fixing faults of created software 
are presented. The proposed model can be useful in 
estimating and monitoring software reliability, which is 
viewed as a measure of software quality. Therefore, it can 
be concluded that this model is more realistic then others for 
a detection of software faults. 
 In the future, the following modified software reliability 
model will be created and investigated. The detected fault 
must be fixed before searching for the next one with the 
assumption that the distributions can change depending on 
number of detected/fixed faults. Examples of the application 
how a model help to have better software will be added.
