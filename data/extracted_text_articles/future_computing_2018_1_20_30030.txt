Abstract—The synchronization in cellular automata has been
known as the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP) since
its development, where the FSSP gives a ﬁnite-state protocol for
synchronizing a large scale of cellular automata. A quest for
smaller state FSSP solutions has been an interesting problem
for a long time. Umeo, Kamikawa and Yun`es [2009] answered
partially by introducing a concept of partial FSSP solutions and
proposed a full list of the smallest four-state symmetric powers-of-
2 FSSP protocols that can synchronize any one-dimensional (1D)
ring cellular automata of length n = 2k for any positive integer
k ≥ 1. Afterwards, Ng [2011] also added a list of asymmetric
FSSP partial solutions, thus completing the four-state powers-of-
2 FSSP partial solutions. The number four is the lower bound
in the class of FSSP protocols. A question: are there any other
four-state partial solutions? remained. In this paper, we answer
the question by proposing a new class of the smallest symmetric
four-state FSSP protocols that can synchronize any 1D ring of
length n = 2k−1 for any positive integer k ≥ 2. We show that the
class includes a rich variety of FSSP protocols that consists of 39
symmetric solutions, ranging from minimum-time to linear-time
in synchronization steps. In addition, we make an investigation
into several interesting properties of these partial solutions, such
as swapping general states and a duality property between them.
Keywords—cellular automata; FSSP; synchronization.

INTRODUCTION
We study a synchronization problem that gives a ﬁnite-state
protocol for synchronizing a large scale of cellular automata.
The synchronization in cellular automata has been known as
the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP) since its
development, in which it was originally proposed by J. Myhill
in Moore [6] to synchronize some/all parts of self-reproducing
cellular automata. The FSSP has been studied extensively for
more than ﬁfty years in [1]-[12].
The minimum-time (i.e., (2n − 2)-step ) FSSP algorithm
was developed ﬁrst by Goto [4] for synchronizing any one-
dimensional (1D) array of length n ≥ 2. The algorithm needed
many thousands of internal states for its realization. After-
wards, Waksman [11], Balzer [1], Gerken [3] and Mazoyer [5]
also developed a minimum-time FSSP algorithm and reduced
the number of states realizing the algorithm, each with 16, 8,
7 and 6 states. On the other hand, Balzer [1], Sanders [8] and
Berthiaume et al. [2] have shown that there exists no four-state
synchronization algorithm. Thus, an existence or non-existence
of ﬁve-state FSSP protocol has been an open problem for a
long time. Umeo, Kamikawa and Yun`es [9] answered partially
by introducing a concept of partial versus full FSSP solutions
and proposing a full list of the smallest four-state symmetric
powers-of-2 FSSP partial protocols that can synchronize any
1D ring cellular automata of length n = 2k for any positive
integer k ≥ 1. Afterwards, Ng [7] also added a list of
asymmetric FSSP partial solutions, thus completing the four-
state powers-of-2 FSSP partial solutions. A question: are there
any other four-state partial solutions? remained.
In this paper, we answer the question by proposing a
new class of the smallest four-state FSSP protocols that can
synchronize any 1D ring of length n = 2k −1 for any positive
integer k ≥ 2. We show that the class includes a rich variety
of FSSP protocols that consists of 39 symmetric solutions,
ranging from minimum-time to linear-time in synchronization
steps. In addition, we make an investigation into several inter-
esting properties of these partial solutions, such as swapping
general states and a duality between them.In Section 2, we
give a description of the 1D FSSP on rings and review some
basic results on ring FSSP algorithms. Section 3 presents a
new class of the symmetric partial solutions for rings. Section
4 gives a summary and discussions of the paper.

FIRING SQUAD SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM ON
RINGS
A. Deﬁnition of the FSSP on Rings
The FSSP on rings is formalized in terms of the model of
cellular automata. Figure 1 shows a 1D ring cellular automaton
consisting of n cells, denoted by Ci, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. All cells
are identical ﬁnite state automata. The ring operates in lock-
step mode such that the next state of each cell is determined by
both its own present state and the present states of its right and
left neighbors. All cells (soldiers), except one cell, are initially
in the quiescent state at time t = 0 and have the property
whereby the next state of a quiescent cell having quiescent
neighbors is the quiescent state. At time t = 0 the cell C1
(general) is in the ﬁre-when-ready state, which is an initiation
signal to the ring.

One-dimensional (1D) ring cellular automaton
The FSSP is stated as follows: given a ring of n identical
cellular automata, including a general cell which is activated at
time t = 0, we want to give the description (state set and next-
state transition function) of the automata so that, at some future

time, all of the cells will simultaneously and, for the ﬁrst time,
enter a special ﬁring state. The set of states and the next-state
transition function must be independent of n. Without loss of
generality, we assume n ≥ 2. The tricky part of the problem is
that the same kind of soldier having a ﬁxed number of states
must be synchronized, regardless of the length n of the ring.
A formal deﬁnition of the FSSP on ring is as follows: a
cellular automaton M is a pair M = (Q, δ), where
1)
Q is a ﬁnite set of states with three distinguished
states G, Q, and F. G is an initial general state, Q is
a quiescent state, and F is a ﬁring state, respectively.
2)
δ is a next state function such that δ : Q3 → Q.
3)
The quiescent state Q must satisfy the following
conditions: δ(Q, Q, Q) = Q.
A ring cellular automaton Mn of length n, consisting of
n copies of M, is a 1D ring whose positions are numbered
from 1 to n. Each M is referred to as a cell and denoted
by Ci, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We denote a state of Ci at time
(step) t by St
i, where t ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. A conﬁguration of
Mn at time t is a function Ct : [1, n] → Q and denoted
as St
1St
2 .... St
n. A computation of Mn is a sequence of
conﬁgurations of Mn, C0, C1, C2, ...., Ct, ..., where C0 is
a given initial conﬁguration. The conﬁguration at time t + 1,
Ct+1, is computed by synchronous applications of the next
transition function δ to each cell of Mn in Ct such that:
St+1
1
= δ(St
n−1, St
1, St
2), St+1
i
= δ(St
i−1, St
i, St
i+1), for any
i, 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and St+1
n
= δ(St
n−1, St
n, St
1).
A synchronized conﬁguration of Mn at time t is a conﬁgura-
tion Ct, St
i = F, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
The FSSP is to obtain an M such that, for any n ≥ 2,
1)
A synchronized conﬁguration at time t = T(n),
CT (n) =
n



F, · · · , F can be computed from an initial
conﬁguration C0 = G
 n−1


Q, · · · , Q.
2)
For any t, i such that 1 ≤ t ≤ T(n) − 1, 1 ≤ i ≤
n, St
i ̸= F.
B. Full vs. Partial Solutions
One has to note that any solution in the original FSSP
problem is to synchronize any array of length n ≥ 2. We call
it full solution. Berthiaume et al. [2] presented an eight-state
full solution for the ring. On the other hand, Umeo, Kamikawa,
and Yun`es [9] and Ng [7] constructed a rich variety of 4-
state protocols that can synchronize some inﬁnite set of rings,
but not all. We call such protocol partial solution. Here, we
summarize recent developments on small state solutions in the
ring FSSP. Berthiaume, Bittner, Perkovic, Settle, and Simon [2]
gave time and state lower bounds for the ring FSSP, described
in Theorems 1, 2, and 3, below.
Theorem 1 (Time Lower Bound) The minimum time in which
the ring FSSP could occur is no earlier than n steps for any
ring of length n.
Theorem 2 There is no 3-state full solution to the ring FSSP.
Theorem 3 There is no 4-state, symmetric, minimal-time full
solution to the ring FSSP.
Umeo, Kamikawa, and Yun`es [9] introduced a class of
partial solutions to the FSSP and showed that there exist 17
symmetric 4-state partial solutions to the ring FSSP.
Theorem 4 There exist 17 symmetric 4-state partial solutions
to the ring FSSP for the ring of length n = 2k for any positive
integer k ≥ 1.
Ng [7] added a list of 80 asymmetric 4-state solutions, this
completing the powers-of-two solutions.
Theorem 5 There exist 80 asymmetric 4-state partial solutions
to the ring FSSP for the ring of length n = 2k for any positive
integer k ≥ 1.
C. A Quest for Four-State Partial Solutions for Rings
•
Four-state ring cellular automata
Let M be a four-state ring cellular automaton M
= {Q, δ}, where Q is an internal state set Q =
{A, F, G, Q} and δ is a transition function such that δ :
Q3 → Q. Without loss of generality, we assume that
Q is a quiescent state with a property δ(Q, Q, Q) = Q, G
is a general state, A is an auxiliary state and F is the
ﬁring state, respectively. The initial conﬁguration is
G
n−1
  
QQ, ..., Q for n ≥ 2. We say that an FSSP solution is
symmetric if its transition table has a property such
that δ(x,y, z) = δ(z, y, x), for any state x, y, z in
Q. Otherwise, the FSSP solution is called asymmetric
one.

A computer investigation into four-state FSSP so-
lutions for rings
Figure 2 is a four-state transition table, where a symbol
• shows a possible state in Q = {A, F, G, Q}. Note
that we have totally 426 possible transition rules.
We make a computer investigation into the transition
rule set that might yield possible FSSP solutions.
Our strategy is based on a backtracking searching.
A similar technique was employed in Ng [7]. Due
to the space available, we omit the details of the
backtracking searching strategy. The outline of those
solutions will be described in the next section.

FOUR-STATE SYMMETRIC PARTIAL SOLUTIONS
In this section, we will establish the following theorem
with a help of computer investigation.
Theorem 6 There exist 39 symmetric 4-state partial solutions
to the ring FSSP for the ring of length n = 2k − 1 for any
positive integer k ≥ 2.

Let RS i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 39 be a transition table for symmetric
solutions obtained in this paper. We refer to the ith symmetric
transition table as symmetric solution i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ 39.
The details are as follows:
•
Symmetric Minimum-Time Solutions:
We have got 24 minimum-time symmetric partial
solutions operating in exactly T(n) = n steps. We
show their transition rules RS i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 24 in Figures
3 and 4.
•
Symmetric Nearly Minimum-Time Solutions:
We have got 14 nearly minimum-time symmetric
partial solutions operating in T(n) = n + O(1) steps.
Their transition rules RS i, 25 ≤ i ≤ 38 are given in
Figure 4. Most of the solutions, that is, solutions 25-
37 operate in T(n) = n + 1 steps. The solution 38
operates in T(n) = n + 2 steps.
•
Symmetric Non-Minimum-Time Solution:
It is seen that one non-minimum-time symmetric par-
tial solution 39 exists. Its time complexity is T(n) =
(3n + 1)/2. The transition rule RS 39 is given in Fig.
4.
In Table I, we give the time complexity and number of
transition rules for each symmetric solution.

Solution 15

Snapshots on 7 and 15 cells for symmetric solutions 2, 7, 13, and 15
Here, we give some snapshots on 7 and 15 cells for
minimum-time, nearly minimum-time and non-minimum-time
FSSP solutions, respectively, in Figures 5, 6, and 7.
Now, we give several interesting observations obtained for
the rule set.
Observation 1 (Swapping General States)
It is noted that some solutions have a property that both of
the states G and A can be an initial general state without
introducing any additional transition rules and yield successful
synchronizations from each general state.
For example, solution 1 can synchronize any ring of length
n = 2k − 1, k ≥ 2 in T(n) = n steps from both an ini-
tial conﬁguration G
 n−1


Q, · · · , Q and A
 n−1


Q, · · · , Q, respectively. Let
TG−RS i(n) (or simply TG(n), if the rule number is speciﬁed)
and TA−RS i(n) (TA(n)) be synchronization steps staring the
solution RS i from the state G and A, respectively, for rings

Solution 20
Fig. 6.
Snapshots on 7 and 15 cells for symmetric solutions 20, 23, 24, and
25
of length n. Then, we have TG−RS 1(n) = TA−RS 1(n) = n.
In Fig. 8, we show some synchronized conﬁgurations on
3, 7, and 15 cells with a general G (left) and A (right),
respectively, for the solution 1. The observation doesn’t always
hold for all symmetric rules. For example, the solution 3 can
synchronize any ring of length n = 2k −1, k ≥ 2 in T(n) = n
steps from the general state G, but not from the state A.
The Observation 1 yields the following duality relation
among the four-state rule sets.
Observation 2 (Duality)
Let x and y be any four-state FSSP solution for rings and x is
obtained from y by swapping the states G and A in y and vice
versa. We say that the two rules x and y are dual concerning

Solution 1 with a general-state A
Solution 1 with a general-state G
Fig. 8.
Synchronized conﬁgurations on 3, 7, and 15 cells with a general-state
G (upper) and A (lower), respectively, for the Solution 1
question by proposing a new class of the smallest four-state
FSSP protocols that can synchronize any 1D ring of length
n = 2k − 1 for any positive integer k ≥ 2. We show that the
class includes a rich variety of FSSP protocols that consists of
39 symmetric solutions, ranging from minimum-time to linear-
time in synchronization steps. Some interesting properties in
the structure of 4-state partial solutions have been discussed.
We strongly believe that no smallest solutions exist other than
the ones proposed for length 2k rings in Umeo, Kamikawa and
Yun`es [9] and Ng [7] and for rings of length 2k − 1 in this
paper. A question: how many 4-state partial solutions exist for
arrays (open-rings)? remains open. We think that there would
be a large number of the smallest 4-state partial solutions for
arrays. Its number would be larger than several thousands. The
structure of the 4-state array partial synchronizers is far more
complex than the 4-state ring partial synchronizers.
