Abstract— A wideband and high gain corrugated epsilon 
negative index metamaterial (ENG) Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna 
(AVA) with gain>12 dBi and working in frequency range from 
10 GHz - 25 GHz (for SATCOM applications) is proposed in 
this paper. The overall performance of the proposed AVA is 
enriched by using a triangular shaped corrugation slots and pi 
(∏) shaped epsilon negative metamaterial cells. The ‘∏’ 
shaped metamaterial unit cells are positioned on the upper 
surface amid both radiators of AVA to emanate the intense 
electric field in the end-fire direction. The proposed antenna 
size is 22.6 mm × 15.8 mm x 1.6 mm and it is designed on the 
FR4 substrate. The maximum gain of the antenna is 12.2 dBi at 
14.5 GHz.

INTRODUCTION  
     To accomplish pervasive connectivity on the globe, 
SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM) is a crucial 
constituent of next-generation wireless communications. In 
recent times, a significant amount of research work has been 
proposed to design various vital components [1][2] for 
SATCOM applications. The Vivaldi antenna was proposed 
and designed by Gibson for high-frequency applications [3]. 
Later, Gazit improved it by giving it an antipodal shape to 
enhance the bandwidth and gain [4]. By incorporating 
numerous enhancement methods e.g., adding parasitic 
patch, dielectric lens, array and metamaterial, the 
parameters of the Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (e.g., 
directivity, bandwidth, reduction inside lobe level etc.) can 
be improved. In [5], a parasitic patch of elliptical shape is 
used to increase the directivity of the Antipodal Vivaldi 
Antenna (AVA), but it has the drawback of bigger size. The 
dielectric lens used in [6] upsurges the end-fire radiations, 
but at the cost of a large size. The AVA Array design 
proposed by [7] increases the gain but suffers from 
augmented mutual coupling due to proximity of antenna 
elements. Amongst several techniques, the enhancement 
technique using metamaterial is quite effective without 
increasing the size of an antenna. After an intensive 
literature review, it is established that little work is done on 
AVA with metamaterial for SATCOM applications. This 
paper presents a compact and enhanced gain AVA with 
‘∏’(pi) shaped metamaterial for SATCOM applications. 
 
      The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
elaborates on the design of the proposed conventional AVA. 
Section III deals with the design of the corrugated AVA.  
Section IV covers the design and analysis of corrugated 
AVA with the novel metamaterial unit cells. The simulated 
results of the proposed AVA are discussed in Section V. 
The outcomes of the proposed AVA are concluded in 
Section VI, followed by references. 
II. 
 DESIGN OF CONVENTIONAL AVA (CAVA) 
     Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (AVA) was first proposed by 
Gazit in 1988. It unveils superior features such as wideband, 
high gain, stable radiation pattern and easy fabrication and 
hence it can efficiently gratify the various requirements of 
SATCOM.  It consists of tapered or exponential metallic 
patches on top and bottom plane with a microstrip feed line 
matching with the connector, as shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
                      Figure 1. Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna [8] 
 
      Figure 2 depicts the geometry of the Conventional 
Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (CAVA) simulated in HFSS ver. 
13. This antenna consists of two parts: elliptical curved 
radiation flares and feed line. The top and bottom patches 
act as radiator and ground respectively. The antenna is 
designed on standard and economical substrate FR4 with a 
dielectric constant of 4.4, tan δ as 0.02 and thickness 1.6 
mm and simulated using HFSS ver. 13. As the Antipodal 
antennas operate as a resonant antenna at the lower end of 
frequency band, the antenna length L1 and width W1 is 
determined based on the lowest frequency fL, relative 
dielectric constant Ɛr. The antenna dimensions are calculated 
by using the following equations [8]:

The curve equations are given as     
             
                                                         
Where R1 and R2 are given by:                                  
             
  
              
                       
Here, R1 and R2 are constants, ‘r’ symbolizes the increase 
rate of an exponential curve and, x1, y1, are the initial 
points and x2, y2 are the termination points of the 
exponential curve. 
 
                                    Figure 2. Structure of CAVA 
 
      The dimensions of the CAVA are calculated to have an 
optimized response over the desired bandwidth and they are 
found to be as follows: L1= 22.60 mm, L2 = 5.50 mm, L3= 
17.1 mm, W1= 15.8 mm, W2= 7.2 mm, W3= 4.2 mm. The 
width of the microstrip feedline (W4) is calculated to match 
the characteristic impedance of 50 ohm which comes out to 
be W4= 1.25 mm. The radiating structure of the antenna is 
formed from the intersection of quarters of two ellipses, as 
explained in [9]. 
 
      Figure 3 depicts the S11 response for the CAVA. From 
the curve, it can be seen that the designed CAVA resonates 
below -10 dB in the range of 10.8 GHz to more than 25 
GHz. Figure 4 shows that CAVA achieves low gain at lower 
frequencies with maximum gain of 5.8 dBi only.

Since the proposed CAVA dispenses low gain at lower 
frequencies, corrugation can be used to overcome this 
problem [10]. This will be explained in detail in Section III.      
 
III. 
 DESIGN OF CORRUGATED AVA 
     The low frequency performance of an AVA flare is 
enriched by the corrugation on its outer edges. Figure 5 
depicts the design of the equilateral triangular corrugated 
AVA with slot side length, S = 0.85 mm.

      The simulated S11 response of corrugated AVA is 
depicted in Figure 10. It can be seen that by adding 
corrugation, the lower cutoff frequency shifts to 10.3 GHz. 
The reason behind this shift in frequency is that the slot 
corrugation facilitates the electrical length of the inner taper 
profile to be elongated thereby extending the lower end cut-
off frequency [11]. Further, the corrugation acts as a high 
impedance region due to which the maximum surface 
current remains towards the inner edge of the tapered slot 
reducing side and backlobe radiation, increasing the gain in 
boresight direction [12]. 
      To further enhance the gain and improve the radiation 
characteristics, an array of metamaterial is commonly used 
on AVA aperture [13]. This will be explained in detail in 
Section IV.        
          
IV. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF CORRUGATED  
 AVA WITH METAMATERIAL (MTM) 
 
       To enhance the gain and characteristics of the proposed 
Vivaldi antenna, an array of epsilon negative metamaterial 
(ENG) unit cells is supplemented at its aperture. The 
proposed ‘pi shape (π)’ metamaterial is shown in Figure 6. 
The proposed MTM is placed inside a waveguide with 
Perfect Magnetic Conductors (PMC) on its top and bottom, 
Perfect Electric Conductors (PEC) on its side walls and two 
waveguide ports for excitation, as shown in Figure 7. 
Standard retrieving procedure is followed by using 
transmission and reflection coefficient of the unit cell, as 
described in [14], and it is found that the proposed 
metamaterial unit cell exhibits epsilon negative property, as 
shown in Figure 8. The optimized dimensions (in mm) of 
unit cell are as follows:  A = 1.6, B= 0.25, C=1.35, D = 0.70

18 GHz.

     The MTM array was supplemented to the upper side of 
the antenna radiating aperture to augment the performance 
of the corrugated AVA. Using [15] and analysing by various 
placements and numbers of the proposed metamaterial cells 
for the desired frequency range, it was found that the 
proposed design with six MTM cells at 3-2-1 arrangement 
(from the top), as shown in Figure 9, attains the preferred 
bandwidth with better gain radiating maximum energy in 
the end-fire direction, as will be discussed in Section V.

V.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
      Figure 10 illustrates the simulated results of reflection 
coefficient (S11) with frequency for the corrugated AVA 
and corrugated MTM AVA.  As can be noticed from the 
figure, the reflection coefficient of the corrugated AVA is 
below -10 dB for the frequency range of 10.3 GHz to 25 
GHz. Applying the corrugation technique resulted in 
extension of the lower end frequency limit due to elongation 
of inner taper length. The negative index metamaterial

further ameliorated the lower cut-off frequency making 
S11<-10 dB for the entire range from 10 GHz - 25 GHz.    
                                   
 
 
Figure 10. Comparison of Frequency response of Corrugated AVA and 
Corrugated MTM AVA 
 
       Figure 11 depicts the comparison of the gain plot of 
Corrugated AVA and Corrugated MTM AVA. The 
Corrugated AVA provides gain in the range of 6.5 dBi - 8.6 
dBi, whereas the AVA-M provides the gain in the range of 
7.3 dBi – 12.2 dBi with maximum gain achieved at 14.5 
GHz. As evident from the gain plot, by integrating 
corrugation on both side edges of conducting arms, the gain 
of the proposed antenna increased significantly, especially 
at the lower end of the operating frequency band. Further, 
by integrating the metamaterial unit cells structure, the gain 
enrichment is more pronounced in the mid frequency band. 
Hence, the peak gain is enhanced by approximately 3.8 dBi 
in the desired range after inclusion of metamaterial unit 
cells, which is a significant gain enhancement without 
changing the antenna size.            
 
 
 
Figure 11. Comparison of Gain of Corrugated AVA and  
Corrugated MTM AVA 
 
       Figure 12 and Figure 13 illustrate the radiation patterns 
of the corrugated AVA and the proposed MTM antenna on 
the E-plane and H-plane at 10, 15 and 25 GHz, respectively. 
It can be seen from the radiation pattern that loaded MTMs 
result in better directivity with improvement in gain [16] 
and possess enhanced radiation performance by suppressing 
the undesired side lobes [17] resulting in low side lobe 
levels.

As it is evident that the proposed antenna offers higher 
directivity, but it can be costlier due to the complex 
fabrication process.

VI. CONCLUSION 
        This paper proposes the design and analysis of a high 
gain corrugated AVA with novel epsilon negative (ENG) 
metamaterial. The ENG metamaterial enhances the 
reflection coefficient with a wider bandwidth from 10 to 25 
GHz without increasing the size. Further, the proposed 
corrugated MTM AVA enhances the gain by approximately 
3.8 dBi as compared to corrugated AVA in the desired 
frequency range. As the proposed AVA design provides 
enhanced gain, improved return loss and compactness, it can 
be considered as a suitable candidate for satellite transmitter 
applications.
