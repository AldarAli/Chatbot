Abstract—This paper presents the design and computer 
simulation results of a triplexer based on coupled resonators 
approach. It comprises 6 resonators yielding three passbands 
which are centered at 1.800 GHz, 2.077 GHz and 2.400 GHz 
covering the GSM, UMTS and IEEE 802.11b wireless bands. 
The specification of each band is Chebyshev with maximum 
reflection loss of -20 dB (ripple of 0.04321 dB). A Gradient-
based local optimization technique is here utilized to determine 
the coupling coefficients by minimizing a proposed Cost 
Function. The triplexer can be built regardless of the type of 
resonator. It is only required that they be able to provide the 
optimized coupling coefficients.

INTRODUCTION 
Multiplexers are devices commonly used in microwave 
front-end systems for channel separation. The need to 
operate with multiple services in multiple bands by using a 
single communication device, demands the input signal to be 
separated in various bands. This implies that the circuits of 
microwave transceiver systems have to be larger. In view of 
this, it has become imperative to build devices even smaller. 
Conventional diplexers and triplexers are usually built with a 
junction that splits the input power into two and three parts, 
respectively, each one being directed to a filter tuned at the 
desired frequency band. Normally, matching circuits need to 
be designed to match the filters to the transmission lines 
coming from the junction. This makes the resulting system 
bulkier. Multiplexers based on coupling resonators have 
proved to meet the demand of size reduction, especially 
because they avoid the use of energy distribution network to 
split the incoming signal. For this case, matching the circuit 
is part of its design. Very few triplexers based on coupling 
resonators have been reported. This article presents computer 
simulation results of a triplexer based on coupled resonators, 
without energy distribution network. The theory presented 
here is an extension of the one developed in [1], which is 
applied for the design of power dividers and diplexers. The 
triplexer proposed here comprises 6 resonators operating 
with three passbands centered at 1.800 GHz, 2.077 GHz and 
2.400 GHz. The specification is Chebyshev with maximum 
reflection loss of -20 dB. A Gradient-based local 
optimization technique is used to minimize a proposed Cost 
Function to determine the coupling coefficients. The 
procedure applies to any type of resonator, provided that they 
give the coupling coefficients calculated in the design. This 
paper deals with the state of the art for triplexers, gives the 
description of the triplexer treated here, shows the theory 
involved for its design and presents the simulation results for 
the reflection and transmission losses.   
II. 
THE STATE OF THE ART 
Triplexers using power divider junction have been 
reported in [2,3], where matching circuits need to be 
designed. Also very few triplexers based on coupled 
resonators have been described, but no optimization was 
considered [4,5]. This paper presents the design of a 
triplexer for the wireless band based on the coupling matrix 
optimization and without power junction. As a result, no 
matching circuit is needed. Following the procedure, the 
coupling coefficients are the only control variables to be 
optimized, since the external quality factors are normally 
calculated using the filter theory developed in [6].    
III. 
THE TRIPLEXER DESCRIPTION AND DESIGN 
A triplexer is a four-port device which is described in 
Figure 1. It receives a signal at its input port and splits it in 
three parts, each one tuned at a specific frequency.

These resonators can be in microstrip, waveguide or 
other technology. The coupling coefficients between 
adjacent resonators are designed such that the mid passband 
is collected from resonator 6 (corresponds to port 4) and the 
two side passbands  are  collected from resonators 4 (port 3) 
and 5  (port 3). A central resonator distributes power to the 
three branches of the triplexer. The design theory of coupled 
resonator filters is well developed in [6] and extended in [1] 
for power dividers and diplexers. Figure 3 shows a circuit of 
coupled resonators, which exhibits electric and magnetic 
coupling through their capacitors and inductors and can be 
analyzed from the Kirchhoff′s circuit laws.

where N is the number of resonators,
zri
 is the i-th 
reflection zero and 
zpj
 is the complex frequency where the 
j-th  peak of the reflection loss is observed. Since the 
number of reflection zeros for each passband is 2, only one 
peak in the reflection loss response is observed. This means 
that 3 peaks are observed in the reflection loss response of 
the triplexer (N-3).The coupling coefficients and external 
quality factors form a set of parameters known as control 
variables. In this work, only the coupling coefficients are to 
be optimized, since the calculated external quality factors 
have proved to be very effective for good simulation results 
of the coupling coefficients. The first term in the Cost 
Function is derived from (1) and is minimum when 
calculated at 
zri
. Likewise, the second one is related to the 
points where the peaks of 
s11
 occur. Theory shows that 
they occur for transmission loss given by 10 20

IV. 
PERFORMANCE OF THE TRIPLEXER 
The design was initially done in the normalized 
frequency from the desired specifications in the high 
frequency range. A triplexer with Chebyshev characteristics 
[6] was simulated with maximum reflection loss of -20 dB 
(ripple 0.04321 dB) for each passband. The center 
frequency is 2.077 GHz in the denormalized frequency 
domain. A good guess for the external quality factors can be 
obtained if one considers the triplexer as a filter formed by 6 
resonators. The filter normalized frequency prototype 
elements are then used to calculate the initial guess for the 
external quality factors at ports 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the computer 
simulations. A Gradient-based local optimization technique 
[7] was utilized to obtain the coupling coefficients

range. The calculated external quality factors were found to

. Having been 
calculated, rather than optimized, reduction in the number of 
parameters to be optimized and in the computer time is 
achieved. Furthermore, very good results for the optimized 
coupling coefficients can also be attained. As for the 
coupling coefficients, the initial guess for the computer 
simulation was

Since the algorithm searches for a local minimum, the 
results are sensitive to the initial guess. After 90 iterations 
and a precision of 10-9, the final optimized coupling 
coefficients values were 
m12  .0 6775,
 
m23  .0 6595

 Figure 5 shows the 
response of the triplexer against frequency in the normalized 
frequency. The selectivity of the channels can be improved 
as the number of resonators increases, which makes the 
reflection loss greater in the rejection band.

in the passband centered at 1.800 GHz when compared with 
the other side passband (centered at 2.447 GHz) due to the 
corresponding frequency transformation in (5). Even so, very 
similar responses were attained for the three output 
passbands. It was observed that the number of resonators is 
equal  to  the  number  of  reflection  zeros.  Furthermore, in

order to have three outputs with similar Chebyshev 
specifications, the triplexer must have a number of 
resonators multiple of three, so that each one of the three 
passbands presents the same number of reflection zeros. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Design and simulation results of a triplexer based on 
coupled resonators approach was presented here. Six 
resonators were employed without using any energy 
distribution network. A Chebyshev response for the three 
passbands was achieved, with maximum reflection loss -20 
dB (ripple 0.04321) and fractional bandwidths of 2.5%, 3.3% 
and 2.3% for the left, central and right passbands, 
respectively. A Gradient-based local optimization technique 
was used, which consisted in minimizing a proposed Cost 
Function whose control variables were the coupling 
coefficients. The external quality factors were excluded from 
the optimization procedure, since the calculated values 
yielded satisfactory optimized coupling coefficients. Very 
good simulation results were obtained for the reflection loss 
and transmission loss. As a future work, the triplexer will be 
implemented in microstrip with triangular resonators aiming 
to achieve size reduction.
