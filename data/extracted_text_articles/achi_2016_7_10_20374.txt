Abstract— In this paper, we describe a proposal set of Web 
accessibility guidelines of interaction and interface design for 
people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to help Web 
professionals to design accessible Web interfaces for these 
users.  The guidelines were extracted from an exploratory 
bibliographic survey of 17 works published between 2005 and 
2015 including international recommendations, commercial or 
academic software and peer-reviewed papers. We identified 
107 guidelines that were grouped in 10 categories using the 
affinity diagram technique. Then, we systematized the 
guidelines in each group according to similarities and 
duplicated statements, generating a set of 28 guidelines. As a 
result, we evidenced best practices to design accessible Web 
interfaces for people with ASD based on well succeeded 
solutions presented in works of different contexts. With those 
results, we aim to contribute to the state of the art of cognitive 
Web accessibility. Therefore, we intend to make the set of 
guidelines available in a repository on GitHub. 
Keywords- Web Accessibility; Autism; Guidelines; Universal 
Access; Interface Design for People with Autism.

 INTRODUCTION 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a syndrome which 
affects three developmental abilities: social, communication 
and interest skills [1]–[3]. People with ASD usually present 
difficulties regarding social interaction, verbal and non-
verbal communication and imagination, as well as a 
restricted repertoire of interests and activities [3][4]. As a 
spectrum, ASD has a myriad of characteristics and severity 
degrees related to the level of impairment of skills, from 
mild (high-functional autism) to severe. As soon as it is 
diagnosed, ASD has effective treatments to minimize the 
impact of the impairment of skills and improve life quality of 
people with the syndrome and their families [1]–[3][5].  
In the past 20 years, computer technology has been used 
as a support tool for parents, therapists, educators and people 
with ASD [5]–[8]. Previous works showed that people with 
ASD are interested in technology [7] and that is beneficial to 
a) develop their abilities [6][9]–[11]; b) facilitate their lives 
[12]; and c) be a helpful tool for pedagogical, therapeutic and 
everyday life activities [11][13][14], independent of age. 
Nowadays, devices exploring natural interactions and direct 
manipulation with touch screens, such as tablets, increase the 
acceptance of technology by these users [9][15]–[17]. 
However, even having some successful solutions 
available for this audience, software developers still have a 
limited knowledge on how to develop native or Web-based 
applications suitable for people with ASD. Other cognitive 
disabilities are also challenging for developers. This happens 
mainly because they still do not know how technology is 
used in these users’ life [7]. When we analyze the Web 
context, Web developers and designers have a lack of 
experience working with accessibility [18] and, when they 
have it, it is usually only about people with visual 
disabilities. 
Another bias is that we have few Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI) guidelines to help Web developers design 
for people with ASD [6][19]. Although specific literature 
provides some clues [7][12][20]–[24], the state of art 
regarding cognitive Web accessibility contains fewer works 
than 
expected 
[21]. 
HCI 
guidelines 
provide 
an 
understandable knowledge about needs and preferences of 
people with ASD and can help Web developers understand 
how technology is used by these users [25], also allowing 
Web access equity [21]. 
Thus, researches are needed to investigate which design 
features are critical in providing therapeutic and pedagogical 
support for people with ASD in order to understand the 
potential impact of technology in their change of behavior 
[14][26] and provide a formalization of this knowledge for 
Web developers and designers. 
In this paper, we describe a proposal set of Web 
accessibility guidelines for people with ASD to help Web 
developers to design accessible Web interfaces for these 
users. 
These 
guidelines 
systematize 
and 
formalize 
recommendations and best practices extracted from literature 
and reviewed software. 
This paper is organized as follow: in Section II, we 
present previous works related to the development of 
interface and interaction design guidelines for people with 
ASD, including exclusive and non-exclusive guidelines. In 
Section III, we describe our methodological approach to 
identify, extract and systematize the guidelines presented in 
this work. Section IV presents the proposed set of guidelines 
and describes each category, while in Section V we discuss 
their potential effectiveness for people with ASD. Finally, 
we present our conclusions in Section VI.

II.  
BACKGROUND 
Friedman and Bryan [21] were two of the first to 
formally propose Web accessibility guidelines for people 
with cognitive or neuronal disabilities. Through an extensive 
literature review of 20 studies involving guidelines from 
experts, governments and institutions, the authors established 
the 22 most frequent recommendations on selected works. 
Similarly, Darejeh and Singh [12] investigated usability 
principles for people with low digital literacy, including 
people with cognitive disabilities and ASD. Putnam and 
Chong [8] conducted a survey with parents and educators of 
children and adolescents with autism and adults with autism 
through an online questionnaire to identify software 
solutions that cater to people with ASD. The study does not 
define design recommendations, but highlights aspects that 
can help in building technology products for people with 
ASD considering the objectives, interests and abilities of the 
public. Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), a W3C (World 
Wide Web Consortium) group to delimit Web accessibility 
guidelines, published in 2012 a draft of principles of Web 
accessibility for people with cognitive or neuronal 
disabilities and potential barriers to this group [24]. As these 
recommendations were a draft, the W3C created a task force 
group 
called 
Cognitive 
and 
Learning 
Disabilities 
Accessibility Task Force (COGA) focusing on the area now 
called Cognitive Web Accessibility. In January of 2015, 
COGA published the results of a user research conducted to 
address problems and solutions concerning Web accessibility 
for people with cognitive, neuronal or learning disabilities 
[22]. 
In general, most of the works presented preliminary 
results and need further details about their proposed 
solutions, although they have significant contributions. An 
observed bias is that these works aim to focus on technology 
professional and tend to have more technical content. 
Recommendations considering the skills of a person with 
ASD that can be used by professionals from different areas 
may have a potentially greater adoption and allow 
multidisciplinary works to develop affordable solutions. 
III.  
METHODS 
The process to identify, extract and systematize the 
guidelines presented in this work was conducted in three 
phases: 
A.   Phase 1 – Studies selection 
We conducted an exploratory bibliographic survey to 
selected works about accessibility for people with ASD and 
other cognitive or neuronal disabilities published or 
developed 
between 
2005 
and 
2015. 
We 
analyzed 
international 
recommendations, 
mobile 
and 
desktop 
applications, universal design approaches for educational 
purposed and peer-reviewed papers published in conferences 
and journals. The process of the survey involved an 
extensive search in databases, such as Association of 
Computer Machinery (ACM), IEEE, PubMed and Google 
Scholar. We also performed manual searches to find 
solutions that were not restricted to scientific papers. Table I 
presents the inclusion and exclusion criteria considered to 
select the works. Only the last inclusion criteria were 
mandatory to select or exclude works. 
TABLE I.   
INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA TO SELECT THE 
WORKS TO BE ANALYZED IN PHASE 2 
Inclusion criteria 
Exclusion criteria 
Peer-reviewed papers published 
in conference proceedings or 
scientific journals. 
Unpublished papers, blog posts 
and other materials that did not 
presented verified empirical 
evidences and results. 
Computational 
solutions 
for 
people 
with 
ASD, 
specially 
children. 
Computational solutions focused 
on parents, therapists or educators 
of people with ASD. 
Works approaching accessibility 
recommendations for computing 
systems and/or Web acessibility 
for 
people 
with 
cognitive, 
neuronal or learning disabilities. 
Papers that didn’t described 
clearly the design decisions taken 
to develop the solution regarding 
the needs of people with ASD. 
Works 
approaching 
mainly 
interaction models based on touch 
screens or Web interfaces. 
Works focused on robotics. 
Works and solutions publised or 
developed between 2005 and 
March of 2015. 
Works out of the inclusion 
criteria. 
 
B.   Phase 2 – Extraction  
In this phase, we performed a triage to extract 
recommendations from selected works, where we identified 
107 
potential 
recommendations 
and 
best 
practices. 
Subsequently, we executed a process to group them using a 
process similar to the affinity diagram technique, in order to 
arrange the extracted statements in logical sets according to 
the patterns we could identify in each statement. This process 
resulted in ten categories of guidelines. 
C.   Phase 3 – Consolidation  
Upon grouping the recommendations by affinity 
diagram, 
we 
could 
perceive 
similarities 
between 
recommendations within a group that was not noticed during 
the analysis of the raw material of the 107 recommendations. 
Thus, we did a second grouping process to combine 
analogue recommendations contained in each category, 
refine the statements and systematize the final set of 
guidelines. We also wrote a detailed description of each 
guideline, including how to implement them and their 
respective importance for people with ASD, a gap we 
identified in the selected works. 
IV.  
RESULTS 
Through an exploratory review of literature and available 
software, we selected 17 works according to the criteria of 
Phase 1, divided into international recommendations (3), 
software accessible for people with ASD (3), universal 
design guidelines for learning (1) and peer-reviewed papers 
(10). The selected works came from nine countries (United 
States, Brazil, Italy, England, Israel, India, Malaysia, Chile 
and Hong Kong), except the international recommendations, 
which can be considered global. Although contributions 
from United States correspond to 47% of works, it was still 
possible to bring cultural diversity from different countries.

Regarding the platform, this work is focused on Web-based 
interfaces, but we selected works exploring distinct platforms 
and applications, such as Virtual Reality, Multitouch Table 
and native (desktop or mobile) due to the possibility of 
generalizing recommendations and interaction patterns that 
can be platform-independent.  Most of the works are 
technology specific or accessible for people with ASD, 
although all works from International Recommendations are 
not exclusively focused on ASD. 
In Phase 2, after extracting the potential guidelines, we 
grouped all 107 recommendations, organizing them based on 
a similarity criterion. This process resulted in ten categories 
carefully labeled to represent common elements in Web 
interfaces. The categories are: (G1) Visual and Textual 
Vocabulary; (G2) Customization; (G3) Engagement; (G4) 
Redundant 
Representation; 
(G5) 
Multimedia; 
(G6) 
Feedback; (G7) Affordance; (G8) Navigability; (G9) System 
Status; (G10) Interaction with Touch Screen. 
In Table II, we present a summary of recommendations 
extracted from the first triage, where it is observed that the 
most critical interface design aspects are related to Visual 
and textual vocabulary, Customization, Engagement and 
Redundant Representation, according to the number of 
extracted recommendation and number of works from which 
we extracted these recommendations. At first, we had a 
hypothesis that Customization guidelines would be critical 
due to the diversity of characteristics of people with ASD as 
customization allows them to be in control and to tailor the 
interface according to their preferences. However, one of the 
biggest challenges for people with ASD when using the Web 
are:  a) to  focus or comprehend lengthy sections of text [23]; 
and b) to understand visual/textual information due to 
inaccurate visual and textual communication  [12][22]. It is 
worth mentioning that Visual and textual vocabulary is 
recommended to be the first concern for developers and 
should be complemented with Redundant representation in 
order to increase the potential of being understood.  As 
people with ASD, especially children, may be uncomfortable 
with certain distractive elements and also present some 
difficulties regarding focus and attention, Engagement 
guidelines are important to work memory, attention and 
reading skills on the Web interface.

The final step in Phase 2 was a second arrangement 
process to generate unique guidelines and reduce ambiguity 
and redundancy, since several recommendations in each 
category, 
from 
different 
authors, 
presented 
similar 
statements. As a result, we would formalize a set of 28 
guidelines distributed in the ten categories, as presented in 
Figure 1. The guidelines from Visual and textual vocabulary, 
Customization and Engagement represent about 43% of all 
guidelines, reinforcing their importance when designing 
interfaces for people with ASD.

systematization and summarization. 
A.   Description of the guidelines’ categories 
The consolidated guidelines compound a set of 28 Web 
accessibility recommendations to design and develop 
Websites and Web applications more suitable for people 
with ASD. As mentioned previously, the guidelines are 
distributed in ten categories and each one has a strategic 
scope regarding interface and interaction aspects of a Web 
interface. We describe in the following sections the scope of 
each category. The full set of guidelines ordered by category 
is presented in Table III. 
 
1)   G1 – Visual and textual vocabulary: This category 
presents the most important recommendations, according to 
the works we analyzed. They address the proper use of text 
and images considering particularities of people with ASD. 
About 50% of the works present concerns about text 
structure, language, verbal and pictorial communication, 
reading flow and color contrast. In guideline 1.2 we 
consolidated contributions from four works [12][22]–[24] 
and eight recommendations about the use of proper 
language. 
Guideline 
1.4 
summarizes 
five 
similar 
recommendations extracted from three works [15][27][28] 
related to real world representation of icons and interaction 
patterns. As people with ASD may face barriers to 
understand information and decode language, the guidelines 
of this category can improve the aspect of engaging in 
communication 
[29] 
and 
approach 
social 
and 
communication skills. 
 
2)   G2 – Customization: Guidelines from Customization 
category address recommendation to enable users to tailor 
interfaces according to their needs. It is the second most 
140

important category and it addresses how users with ASD 
can adjust the interface in a more comfortably way to them, 
considering that the syndrome presents a myriad of 
characteristics and it is often risky to identify patterns 
between people with ASD, such as colors preferences. 
 
3)   G3 – Engagement: The guidelines of Engagement 
present recommendations regarding focus, attention and 
strategies to help users interact with the system. These 
guidelines address interface design issues and intersect with 
recommendation of “G1- Visual and textual vocabulary” 
and “G6 -Feedback”. 
 
4)   G4 
– 
Redundant 
representation: 
Redundant 
representation, along with G5 - Multimedia, refers to 
guidelines reinforcing that information should not be linked 
exclusively to a format (text, image or audio). Multiple 
representations 
(specially 
graphical) 
work 
as 
a 
supplementary content [30] and contribute with enrichment 
of the repertory of user’s vocabulary [5][9]. 
 
5)   G5 – Multimedia: Complementing guidelines from 
Redundant Representation, Multimedia’s guidelines detail 
the proper use of multimedia in Web interfaces to work 
memory, attention, visual and textual understanding and 
sensorial integration of people with ASD. 
 
6)   G6 – Feedback: Providing feedback for actions 
performed 
in 
interfaces 
is 
a 
common 
usability 
recommendation independent of the characteristic of users. 
However, incomplete feedbacks or their absence   are 
critical for people with ASD, particularly children, due to 
their potential difficulties to pay attention, deal with changes 
and understand verbal instructions. Thus, feedbacks are 
important for people with ASD to guide them in performing 
tasks, understanding the application behavior and predicting 
the behavior of similar features or elements.  The 
recommendations we extracted were very similar to each 
other, evidencing how this aspect is important and is 
consistently established in different works. As a result, we 
could summarize them into a single guideline. 
 
7)   G7 – Affordance: Guidelines in this category address 
issues to design interface elements that clearly identify how 
they work without a deep investigation or a high cognitive 
effort. Reducing cognitive workload is an important 
accessibility concern when designing interfaces for people 
with ASD. Consequently, interface designers and Web 
developers should pay attention to the Web page element 
which may not specify clearly if they are clickable, 
draggable, pushable, etc. 
 
8)   G8 – Navigability: The guidelines of Navigability 
present recommendation about the navigational structure 
between Web pages. A large amount of information and 
number of links contribute to a bad user experience for 
people with ASD. Therefore, it is recommended to provide 
to the interface: a) a simplified navigation; b) consistent 
location indicators; and c) sequential navigation, when 
applicable. Also, it is important not to prevent users to be in 
control of the navigation flow. 
9)   G9 – System status: The System status’ guidelines 
address recommendations about progress among tasks 
(clearly information about errors, help instructions and 
information related to changes in state of elements). 
 
10)   G10 – Interaction with touch screen: The last 
category presents a recommendation on the use of touch 
screen. We consider this recommendation important since 
Websites and Web applications are increasingly being 
accessed through mobile devices with touch screens. Those 
devices present direct manipulation of interface elements, 
people with ASD tend to interact better to such devices 
[9][15][20] and their interaction model is considered to be 
more natural. Interfaces with direct manipulation require 
less physical efforts and present interaction patterns 
compatible with the real world. 
V.  
BRIEF DISCUSSION 
It is possible to find some software, games and 
applications aimed at teaching and learning of people with 
ASD, both in scientific works and business solutions. 
However, for each of these applications, designers and 
developers may need to thoroughly investigate the most 
suitable design solution for the proposed application or may 
follow generic design guidelines that may not be appropriate 
in the context of software for people with ASD [6][27]. 
By proposing recommendations and guiding principles 
for the development of interfaces accessible to people with 
autism, it is possible to mitigate the lack of knowledge of 
developers and enable the development of more inclusive 
technologies. In addition to allowing the developers to know 
what they should consider when developing appropriate 
solutions for people with ASD, design recommendations can 
contribute to raise awareness of these professionals about the 
characteristics of the person with ASD and how technology 
can be valuable to them. Following recommended guidelines 
for proper software design, designers and developers can 
support the educational goals defined for the application. 
Systematizing contributions from 17 works and selected 
solutions generated a consolidation of contributions that, to 
date, have been dispersed in different types of publications or 
were a tacit knowledge in the design of software solutions. 
Some recommendations may not seem new regarding 
Web accessibility and interface design, e.g., "provide clear 
error messages" and "provide feedback". The difference is 
how the fulfillment of these factors has a different impact for 
people with ASD. When we suggest, for example, avoiding 
using metaphorical expressions in the interface content and 
icons, we can consider this as an important guidance for 
neurologically typical children in literacy age, because they 
often don’t understand some non-literal expressions. But this 
recommendation is even more critical for people with ASD, 
considering that people with autism, in different age range, 
may 
have 
difficulty 
understanding 
and 
interpreting 
metaphors. The proposed guidelines can be used by interface 
designers, Web developers and other professionals involved 
in the design of applications for people with ASD as a 
141

support for decision-making to suggest information and 
resources more consistent with the context of children with 
autism and, potentially, a variety of users.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this work, we investigated and systematized Web 
accessibility recommendations and best practices to design 
Web interfaces suitable for people with ASD. While the 
works we selected usually presented the recommendations in 
a format of single sentence, we decided to develop an 
extended description for each guideline in order to help 
people to implement the guidelines properly and understand 
the rationale of the proposed approach. Some guidelines may 
present technical details, however, our intention is that the 
guidelines can be applied by multidisciplinary teams and 
educational professionals involved with use of digital 
resources for people with ASD.  
Although the focus of the project is Web interfaces, we 
carefully 
propose 
generalized 
descriptions 
for 
most 
guidelines in order to not link them with a specific platform. 
The idea is to enable their application to different interaction 
contexts. 
The full set of guidelines is available at an open-source 
repository on GitHub. Therefore, we hope this content may 
be complemented, distributed, derived and easily   accessible 
to professionals and researches from different areas. 
Finally, the proposed guidelines should provide advances 
in the state of the art of cognitive Web accessibility as: (1) 
support material to develop Websites and Web applications 
adapted to the needs of people with ASD, especially 
children; (2) a guidance documentation about best practices 
and potential challenges about interaction of people with 
ASD with interactive systems; (3) an open source repository 
of recommendations in constant update; (4) a complement to 
literature regarding the biases of Web accessibility for people 
with cognitive or neuronal disabilities, adding techniques 
related to ASD. 
A.   Next steps 
In order to see if the proposed guidelines are effective in 
providing a better interaction for people with ASD, the next 
step of this work involves the development of an educational 
Web application using the guidelines to support the 
interaction design, followed by an experimental evaluation 
with children with ASD. The evaluation aims to observe how 
children react and interact with the application and collect a 
feedback to validate and improve the guidelines.  
Alongside, we intend to: (1) interview parents and 
teacher of children with ASD to understand their perspective 
about using technology as an educational and therapeutic 
resource in order to contemplate their viewpoint into the 
guidelines; (2) perform technical evaluation of the guidelines 
with Web developers, accessibility experts and digital 
educational teachers involved with special education.
