Abstract—Social media communities can be characterized by 
descriptor words that are frequently used by its community 
members but are less often used in other communities. These can 
be extracted by computing a descriptor index and choosing those 
words with the highest index. The novel descriptor index 
proposed here is based on the z-score that measures the 
frequency of a word in a given community relative to the 
frequency of the word in all the communities combined, using a 
statistical standard error. The measure based on z-scores is 
validated by comparing the words extracted when using z-scores 
with the words extracted using the fairly popular Term 
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and the 
Lagus method. Once it is established that z-scores can be used to 
extract descriptor words, the next hurdle is to reduce the 
dimensionality of the vector space model, where each word that 
appears in any of the social community messages would 
constitute one dimension in the vector space model. The solution 
explored here, used in tandem with z-scores as descriptor index 
measure, 
is 
the 
Random 
Projection 
method. 
In 
this 
dimensionality reduction method, more than 40,000 unique 
words (dimensions) are randomly projected to as few as 400 
dimensions (99% reduction) and yet the proposed scheme still 
extracts essentially the same descriptor words for each 
community. To evaluate the combined use of z-scores and 
Random Projection, and to determine some suitable parameter 
values for the proper execution of the Random Projection 
method, 10 communities on Facebook were selected. Despite 
using only 1% of the original number of dimensions, there is a 
match of 85% of the top 10 descriptor words between those 
extracted with all 40,000 dimensions compared to those extracted 
with only 400.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The emergence of social media allowed the users of the 
Internet to share their own content and information with others, 
and to have the opportunity to form their own virtual social 
network [1]. In fact, social media users are drawn together and 
are more likely to connect and participate in a social network 
having people who are popular or people who are similar to 
them, such as other users who prefer to use the same language 
as them [2][3]. 
Characterizing communities in social media networks using 
descriptor words that are frequently used by the community 
members is useful when one needs to quickly distinguish one 
community from another. This can be done by computing a 
descriptor index measure for each word, and choosing the top k 
words with the best descriptor index measures. 
The descriptor index proposed here is based on the z-score 
that measures the relative frequency of a word in a given 
community, with a confidence interval, from the frequency of 
the word in all the communities combined, using a 
standardized computation of the statistical standard error. The 
measure based on z-scores is validated by comparing the words 
extracted when using z-scores with the words extracted using 
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) [4] 
and the Lagus method based on a goodness measure [5]. Such 
descriptor words are very useful in Text Mining [6], as well as 
in other more focused application areas, such as human and 
social analytics. One simply considers the descriptor words to 
have a fairly good idea of what the given social media 
community is concerned with. 
Text mining for all its vast potential, however, faces the 
challenge of having to deal with very large volumes of 
documents. This in turn translates into a very high dimensional 
vector space model – where each word that appears in any of 
the social community documents/messages would constitute 
one dimension in the vector space. The high dimensionality 
elevates both the computational and space complexities [7] of 
any task involving the unique words and phrases that appear in 
the documents.  Indeed, even if we can establish that z-scores 
can be used to extract descriptor words, the next challenge is to 
drastically reduce the dimensionality of the vector space 
model. 
Dimensionality reduction is understandably a widely 
researched area in text mining [7] and other areas, such as 
image processing, bioinformatics, and so on [8][9]. One 
method stands out. The Random Projection method [10] 
randomly projects the high-dimensional features of a dataset 
into a far smaller low-dimensional space, to as little as just 1% 
of the original dimensionality of the vector space. And yet, 
when properly used in combination with other algorithms that 
are compatible with the projection method, the performance of 
the low dimensional space is comparable to that in the original, 
high-dimensional space. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the characterization of social media communities 
with a novel bag-of-words representation using z-scores, and 
validates the proposed approach by comparing the extracted 
descriptor words to those extracted by TF-IDF and the Lagus 
method. Section III illustrates how the Random Projection

method works, and how it can be used in combination with the 
z-scores that are computed as descriptor index. Section IV 
contains the discussion of the experimental results that are 
designed to fine-tune the parameter values of the Random 
Projection method. The paper ends with Section V, which 
contains the conclusions.  
II. CHARACTERIZATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNITIES 
USING Z-SCORE 
 
Online social networking applications nowadays implement 
a “verified user system” to emphasize the importance of 
opinion leaders, such as celebrities having numerous followers 
[11]. These leaders are able to make use of the “public reach” 
provided to them by the social networking site in order to gain 
lots of attentions and to promote their products and services to 
their followers.  
Every social network community formed by a celebrity and 
his/her followers often gravitate towards a small subset of 
words, sometimes transforming to a veritable “jargon”, that 
over time would be good descriptor words that would 
characterize the interest, motivation, and even the socio-
cultural and linguistic characteristics of the community as a 
whole.   
For the rest of the discussions and experiments in this 
paper, we use a huge collection of individual “posts” published 
as public comments on the Facebook pages of 10 well-known 
Filipino celebrities, having hundreds of thousands or even 
millions of followers. These posts were collected using 
Facebook's Graph Application Programming Interface (API) 
[12]. 
The steps of preprocessing the dataset include the removal 
of non-alphanumeric characters, digits, and unnecessary white 
spaces. In addition, both Filipino [13] and English [14] 
standard “stop words” in the posts are removed. The remaining 
tokens/words 
are 
then 
stored 
using 
a 
bag-of-words 
representation in a vector space. This resulted in a large 
celebrity dataset containing 40,126 words, where each unique 
word is considered as an individual “feature”.  
A. Z-score 
The z-scores of each of the words of each of the 
communities are then computed as their “descriptor index”, 
and the top k words with the highest z-scores in each 
community are considered to be the descriptor words.  
The z-score of a word can be calculated using the following 
formula: 
                                      𝑧 =
𝑝−𝑃
𝑆𝐸𝑃                                         (1) 
where p is the proportion of the usage of the word relative to 
all the words in the same community, while P is the proportion 
of the usage of the word relative to all the words in the corpus 
(in this case, all 10 communities). SEP represents the standard 
error of the word in the population. This is computed using the 
following formula: 
                                  𝑆𝐸𝑃 = √
𝑃(1−𝑃)
𝑛
                                (2) 
where n is the number of words in the given community. 
Note that the z-score is very commonly used in statistics to 
test whether the proportion in a given sample is no different 
from the “ideal” proportion, in this case the population 
proportion. Candidate descriptor words of a community have 
proportion p that is significantly larger compared to P 
(proportion in all the communities combined).  
To test the plausibility of using z-score in extracting the 
descriptor words of a community, we compute these scores for 
each word in each of the 10 communities and we extract the 
top 10 descriptor words. These are shown in Figure 1 as word 
clouds. Note that the communities have different descriptor 
words, and when taken together, they give a good idea of the 
type of discussions that happen in each community. For 
example, the celebrity “Mocha Uson” has “Duterte (current 
president of the Philippines)”, “pangulo (president)” and 
“bayan” (country) as descriptor words. Indeed, she was an 
active endorser of President Duterte on social media since the 
campaign 
period 
in 
late 
2015. 
The 
socio-linguistic 
characteristics of the celebrities are also apparent. Lea Salonga, 
Erwan Heussaff, and Anne Curtis have posts that are mostly in 
English, while the others are mostly in Tagalog. One of the 
known local celebrities who is known to often be talking of her 
son has the nickname of her son as one of the extracted 
descriptor words. Another female celebrity has the name of her 
husband, also a local celebrity, among the descriptor words.  
 
Fig. 1. Top 10 descriptor words for every celebrity, whose names are written 
in red text, if z-score is used as the measure to characterize each community. 
Note that descriptor words need not be unique to a given 
community. However, when descriptor words are far too 
common, and appear as descriptor in almost all communities, 
then they are no longer suitable descriptor words. From Figure 
1, we note that using the z-scores kept two terms po and thank, 
which are tagged as descriptor words for two celebrity 
communities. This can be caused by the 2 communities having 
an extraordinarily high proportion of usage of the terms – such 
as the Tagalog speakers who use the “po” (as a sign of 
politeness) in almost every sentence. 
B. TF-IDF 
TF-IDF is the function commonly used to measure the 
importance of the terms in a given document [15]. This is a 
standard metric in the vector space model for text mining 
where the best terms to represent a document are those with 
25

high Term Frequency (TF) but at the same time should also be 
rarely used in other documents - high Inverse Document 
Frequency (IDF).  
In a way, TF alone can be used to extract the descriptor 
words of a community. It is the proportion of the occurrences 
of a given term to the entirety of the terms in a given 
community. The formula for computing TF is as follows: 
 
                                 𝑇𝐹𝑖,𝑗 =
𝑛𝑖,𝑗 
𝑁𝑗                                         (3) 
where ni,j would be the number of occurrences of term i in 
document j and Nj represents the totality of the terms in 
document j. 
The suitability of TF as index to extract the descriptor 
words of the communities is also evaluated. Using TF as the 
measure in finding the descriptor words of a community is only 
partially able to achieve its goal. More words, such as thank, 
good, si, po, day, and watch, are extracted for a multiple 
number of communities. This means that TF alone is not able 
to truly extract descriptor words when we also require that the 
ideal descriptor words are common in a given community, but 
relatively less common in the other communities.  
 
IDF [16] is thus introduced to favor terms that are 
concentrated only in a few documents/communities. This 
measure ranges from 0, which represents the words that 
occurred in the entire corpus, to 1, which represents the words 
that occurred only in one document/community of the entire 
corpus. The formula for computing IDF is as follows:  
 
                                𝐼𝐷𝐹𝑖 = log (
𝐷
𝑑𝑖)                                  (4) 
where D is the total number of documents in the corpus and di 
is the number of documents using the term i. 
Given the nature of IDF, it cannot be used as a lone 
measure to obtain the descriptor words for a community, but it 
can be applied to retrieve the words that are common in the 
corpus, or the words that only occur in a handful of 
communities.  
Combining the weights of both the TF and IDF into the TF-
IDF measure would indeed improve the extraction of the 
descriptor words of a document as it combines the importance 
of the words inside a specific community, and the exceptional 
words in the 10 communities (entire corpus). Using the TF-IDF 
removes the terms that are too commonly used, such as day, 
thank, love, today, tonight, and the like, and some of the very 
common Filipino stop words that are not covered in the stop 
word list, such as po, natin, yung, lang, and such. 
C. Goodness Measure 
The Lagus method, based on a measure of goodness, 
describes yet another descriptor word index [5]. It can be 
observed by ranking the words used in the communities based 
on the following criteria that: (1) the given word should be 
more prominent in a community compared to the other words 
in the same community, and (2) the given word is relatively 
more prominent in the specified community in the rest of the 
corpus. The formula for computing the goodness of a 
characteristic word w given document/community  j is as 
follows [17]: 
 
                          𝐺(𝑤, 𝑗) = Fj(𝑤)
𝐹𝑗(𝑤)
∑ 𝐹𝑖(𝑤)
𝑖
                         (5) 
where Fj(w) is the proportion of the term w and all the terms in 
community j. 𝐹𝑗(𝑤)/ ∑ 𝐹𝑖(𝑤)
𝑖
 compares the importance of the 
word w in community j with its importance in the corpus.  
D. Comparison of Results 
Using the z-score as descriptor index measure can be 
validated by comparing it to other probability-based measures 
such as TF, TF-IDF or the Lagus method. A large intersection 
among the top 10 words when z-score is used as the measure 
and the top 10 words when the other measures are used would 
indicate that z-scores are also effective for determining the 
descriptor index measure of words. The intersections for the 
communities of each of the chosen celebrities are shown in 
Table I.

AVERAGE

Using the z-score as the measure to find the descriptor 
words of the communities yields an average of 7.9 out of the 
top 10 words when compared to using the Lagus method, and 
averages of 6.9 and 4.5 when compared to TF and IDF, 
respectively. Much like when evaluating alternative methods 
that recognize specific objects from images [18][19] (which 
just need to list the correct object somewhere within the top 5 
predicted objects in an image), we do not require that the top 
descriptor word in each community, that are extracted using z-
scores, would be the same descriptor words extracted when 
using TF, TF-IDF and the Lagus method.  Since there is no real 
“ground truth” as to which are the real top 10 descriptor words, 
we would simply need to see that there is some fair amount of 
intersection among the extracted descriptor words when 
compared to the other methods.  
We also compare the results yielded when using TF to TF-
IDF and the goodness measure (Table II). Compared to using 
z-scores, TF is only able to get an average of 2.9 out of the top 
10 words when compared to the TF-IDF measure, and an 
average of 5.6 out of the top 10 words for the goodness 
measure. Lastly, we evaluate the Lagus method by comparing 
it to the TF-IDF measure in extracting the top descriptive

The goodness measure of the Lagus method can extract an

TF-IDF, which has a similar performance as the z-score. 
Overall, with all the comparisons made, the statistical 
capabilities of the z-score measure in extracting the descriptive 
words of the celebrity communities make it a suitable 
descriptor index measure.  
III. APPLICATION OF RANDOM PROJECTION 
The general idea of Random Projection [10] is to project 
the large number of dimensions of a text corpus (in this case, 
the single vector space for the 10 social communities) into a 
much smaller vector space with the number of features being a 
very small fraction of the original number. Random Projection, 
as depicted in (6), 
                              𝐷(𝑖, 𝑗) → 𝐷′(𝑖, 𝑚)                               (6) 
transforms 
vector 
space 
D 
having 
i 
documents 
(messages/communities), and j unique words each of which is 
a dimension in D, into vector space D′ having the same i 
documents (communities), and m features, where m << j. 
The projection takes two parameters, m and r. The first 
parameter m is the (much smaller) number of features of D′, 
and r represents the number of times a given word (feature) is 
mapped into any of the m dimensions in the projected space D′.  
Random projection uses a j x m projection matrix, where 
every feature in D corresponds to a row in R. The m columns 
are the components that act as the new features found in D′, 
such that each column in D′is in fact the sum of frequencies of 
a very large number of randomly selected words. Each word in 
turn is randomly mapped by R to r different columns in D′.  At 
r = 5 or more, there is a small chance that two unique words 
would have been mapped by R to exactly the same 5 columns 
in D′.  
Constructing the projection matrix R consists of randomly 
selecting r unique dimensions in m for each of the j words. A 
value of 1 is given to each of the r selected components, while 
all remaining m – r dimensions of row j are set to 0. The values 
for every document/community in D are computed as follows: 
        𝑑′[𝑓1 … 𝑓𝑚] =  𝑑[𝑓1 … 𝑓𝑗] ∗ [
𝑅11
…
𝑅1𝑚
⋮
⋱
 
𝑅𝑗1
 
𝑅𝑗𝑚
]
𝑇
          (7) 
where d' is the resultant, compressed vector in D′ for each 
document d in D.  
This Random Projection method thus yields a highly 
compressed and compact dataset, where each dimension 
encodes the frequencies of a very large number of words. Note 
that by the nature of Random Projection, it is not 
straightforward to choose from m dimensions those that might 
point us to the suitable set of descriptor words. And, since each 
of the m dimensions would have mixed up the term frequencies 
of thousands of words, Random Projection would not be 
compatible with approaches such as the TF-IDF, which relies 
heavily on the “rarity” of occurrence of candidate words in 
documents/communities other than the one for which a 
descriptor word is being searched. 
In the rest of this paper, we go back to z-scores and 
demonstrate that it is feasible to use it in combination with the 
Random Projection method – and thus benefit from the ability 
of the latter to significantly lower the number of dimensions 
and improve on the time and space complexity of the over-all 
approach.  
Since a z-score relies heavily on the TF except that it also 
incorporates a test for statistically significant differences in 
proportions between candidate words, we now show how z-
scores can still be used to select descriptor words, even if we 
drastically reduce the dimensions of our vector space. 
All the words in the original dataset are first given the 
projected z-score value based on the summation of the z-scores 
of the components in D' where they are projected. As an 
example, given that the word f1 is projected into the 
components m0, m3, m5, and m10, then w is given the value of 
the summation of the z-scores of the stated components. The 
process, as shown in Figure 2, is done for all words in the 
original dataset. 
 
Fig. 2. Process of computing the projected z-score, wz1, of the candidate 
descriptor word f1. The z-scores z1, z3, z5, and z10 of the components where f1 is 
projected are added to determine its projected z-score.

IV. RANDOM PROJECTION BASED ON Z-SCORES 
A. Filtering of Riders 
 
Because of how Random Projection works, we can expect 
that certain words can be mistakenly selected as a descriptor 
word simply because in the projection they happen to be 
mapped to the same dimensions where the real descriptor 
words get mapped to as well. These words are what we call 
riders - that piggy-back on the real descriptor words and thus 
get high scores for themselves. 
Removing such riders turns out to be straightforward. We 
simply apply the Random Projection k times, and words that do 
not get consistently high scores are plain riders. The final 
scores of the words are computed by taking the average of their 
projected scores in all of the k trials. 
A maximum of 15 Random Projection trials are performed 
to test if the performance is affected by the number of trials 
done. Parameter values for the projection matrix used are m = 
400 and r = 10. The performance is measured by the number of 
words that are extracted using only m dimensions that match 
those extracted words when using all 40,000 dimensions and 
the comparison is presented in Table III.

Performing Random Projection twice already significantly 
improves its performance from 66% to 76% among top 5 
words, and 43% to 68% among top 10 words, when compared 
to only having done Random Projection once. This shows that 
the riders are easily removed. And, as the number of trials 
increases, the performance rate of Random Projection 
improves further. From 9 trials onwards, the performance rate 
stabilizes between 82% to 84% when taking the top 5 words, 
while for taking the top 10 words, performance is between 87% 
to 89%. Since we would not want to make more trials (runs) 
than what is necessary, we just use 10 trials for the remaining 
experiments that needed to be conducted to further fine-tune 
the method. 
B. Improving Random Projection Results 
 
We proceed to further improve the performance of the 
approach by encoding the z-scores before they are accumulated 
during Random Projection, such as taking the log10 value, its 
square root, or by squaring it. Taking the log10 or the square 
root of the z-scores tends to diminish the differences among z-
scores, while taking the squared-value would obviously 
increase the effect of the differences among z-scores (which 
are mostly numbers greater than 1.0).  
 
In the following experiments, both m and r parameters of 
Random Projection are given the same old values of 400 and 
10, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the techniques 
applied, we again use the intersection of the top 5 and top 10 
descriptor words using the raw non-projected z-scores (all 
40,000 dimensions are used) and the projected raw or encoded 
z-scores. The comparison of performances for the different 
measures applied is shown in Table IV.

Indeed, adding encoding to the z-scores has a noticeable 
effect on the performance of Random Projection. The baseline 
performance rate of using the raw z-score is 56% when getting 
the top 5 words, and 33% when getting the top 10 words. Table 
IV shows that the performance worsens when we use the 
squared values of the z-scores. Upon inspection, we noticed 
that, what happened in face was that, when we square the z-
scores, the riders increase in rank and get selected. Indeed, 
squaring the z-scores yielded a performance rate of only 36% 
when taking the top 5 words, and 19% for the top 10 words.  
 
Table IV also shows that, when we diminish the importance 
of the differences among z-scores by getting the log10 or their 
square root values, we see an improvement in the performance 
rate of Random Projection. Using log10 yields performance 
rates of 62% and 38% when getting the top 5, and 10 words, 
respectively. Taking the square root of the z-scores has the best 
performance rates of 66% for the top 5 words, and 43% for the 
top 10 words. 
 
The performance rates can be even further improved. To 
fully utilize the capabilities of Random Projection, the next 
step is to try to find good values for the two parameters: r, the 
number of times the features will be projected, and m, the 
number of features of the projected, reduced dataset.  
Various combinations of the two parameters, m and r are 
evaluated. The values of m start with 100, which is then 
doubled until the value reaches 3,200 (roughly 8% of the 
original number of dimensions). For r, the experiments start 
with a value of 5.  In this paper, we only show the results for r 
having values 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80.

This time, 10 trials of Random Projection are done (to 
remove the riders) and the square root representation of the z-
scores are used, at a fixed value of m = 400. The comparison of 
the performances of the different values of r is shown in Table 
V.

From Table V, it can be observed that parameter r can be 
set to low values of 10, or even 5, and yet, good results of over 
80% can be achieved. We are left with now finding the value 
of m, which was set to 400 in the experiments earlier.  
The final experiment evaluates the performance of Random 
Projection when the m parameter is given differing values. For 
the remaining experiments, 10 trials and square root encoding 
are used, with the r parameter set to 5. The comparison of the 
performance rates is shown in Table VI.

As the value of m increases, the performance rate of 
Random Projection also understandably improves. But since 
the aim of dimensionality reduction is to get good results in 
significantly less amount of time, we would prefer lower 
values for m. At m = 3,200, the performance rate is 90% when 
taking the top 5 descriptor words, and 94% when taking the top 
10 words. Dramatically reducing the number of dimensions to 
even just 10% of its original size, at m = 400, Random 
Projection still yields a decent performance of 84% and 85% 
when taking the top 5 and top 10 descriptor words, 
respectively. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The computation of a descriptor index to extract the 
descriptor words that characterize social media communities 
can indeed be based on the z-score that measures the relative 
frequency of a word in a given community compared to its 
frequency in all the communities combined.  
This novel measure is validated using a collection of 
"posts" published by 10 well-known Filipino celebrities on 
their Facebook pages. The words extracted using the z-scores 
are compared with the words extracted using the TF, TF-IDF, 
and the Lagus method based on the goodness measure to 
establish that z-scores can be effective as basis for extracting 
descriptor words. 
The other challenge addressed in this paper is the reduction 
of the dimensionality of the vector space using the Random 
Projection method. This dimensionality reduction method 
randomly projects more than 40,000 unique words to as few as 
400 dimensions. This method is used alongside the z-scores as 
descriptor index measure to accurately and efficiently extract 
descriptor words for each community. 
The combination of z-scores and Random Projection is 
evaluated 
using 
the 
celebrity 
dataset. 
Reducing 
the 
dimensionality of the original 40,000 dimensions to only 8% of 
it (3,200 dimensions) yields a 94% match among top 10 
descriptor words compared to using all 40,000 dimensions. 
Pushing the dimensionality reduction further, using only 1% of 
the original number of dimensions produces a match of 85% of 
the top 10 descriptor words compared to those extracted using 
all 40,000 dimensions. For further benchmarking and 
validation of the approach, future experiments may concentrate 
on even larger social media communities, preferably those 
using English, Spanish, or French, so that a larger comparison 
and evaluation among alternative techniques may be 
conducted.
