Abstract — Atomic migration and electronic switching of 
bi-stable centers in conducting filaments formed in nanooxide 
based resistive random access memory (RRAM) cells are 
modeled and analyzed as competitive mechanisms determining 
their operation frequency.  They are demonstrated to be 
mediated by the filament growth dynamics.  Atomic migration 
is shown to be responsible for a slow change of the filament 
resistivity with typical switching times in the millisecond range. 
Fast switching with the shortest nanosecond delay can be 
achieved using bi-stable electronic centers in the filaments. 
Possible configurations of such centers are discussed. 
Keywords - resistive switching; nanooxide; memory cell.

 INTRODUCTION 
Currently, metal nanooxide-based resistive switching 
memory is being studied extensively as one of the most 
competitive candidates for non-volatile memory applications 
because of its simple structure, rapid switching and excellent 
scalability. 
The 
mechanisms 
of 
resistive 
switching 
phenomena in oxides can be quite diverse. One possible 
mechanism is electronic switching, originating from a 
trap/de-trap process through defects in the oxides [1]. 
Another possible mechanism is ionic switching, which is 
usually attributed to the formation/rupture of conductive 
filaments (CFs), which may consist of oxygen vacancies or 
metal precipitates [2][3]. It is illustrated in Figure 1.   
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Dynamic growth and formation/rupture processes of 
filament-type resistive switching mechanism in unipolar (a) and bipolar 
switching (b) modes [3]. 
 
The process of CFs formation and their transition from an 
initial high resistance state (HRS) to a low resistance state 
(LRS) are interpreted as a dielectric soft breakdown 
associated with the migration of oxygen ions toward the 
anode, and the formation of CFs in the bulk oxide connecting 
both electrodes. In the unipolar reset process where the reset 
occurs at the same polarity as the set, joule-heating-assisted 
diffusion of oxygen ions from the anode occurs and the 
surrounding oxides rupture the CFs by recombining with 
oxygen vacancies or by the re-oxidation of metal 
precipitates. Cooling down and formation of a functional 
region in the CFs occur during the set process (Figure 1). In 
the bipolar reset process that occurs at the polarity opposite 
to the set process, oxygen ions drifting in the applied electric 
field rupture the CFs. 
Combined diffusion and drift ion transport may be 
considered to be a driving mechanism of the slow switching 
[4]. Fast electronic switching is provided by the 
synchronized process of the capture and release of mobile 
charge carriers on the bi-stable trapping states in the regions 
of the formation/rupture of CFs. These states are caused by 
the presence of oxygen vacancies. Both atomic and 
electronic mechanisms are modeled and discussed in this 
paper.  
The dynamic model of CFs formation and the switching 
model of bi-stable trapping states in the oxide are described 
in Section II. Section III presents results of the computer 
simulations based on the above models for HfO2-based 
metal/insulator/metal nanostructures with the emphasis to 
their application for resistive random access memory 
(RRAM) cells.

MODELS 
The dynamics of CFs formation are considered to be 
determined by the motion of their constituent ions in the 
electric field. The growth rate of the filament is defined by 
the drift speed of the moving ions. Supposing hope jumping 
of the ions over the energy barrier U it is [5]:

In the model considering electronic states, switching of 
bi-stable traps in the oxide is supposed to be responsible for 
the interplay between its HRS and LRS. Such switching is 
induced by a thermal noise. We simulate it using the 
following equation [6]:

where y is the generalized coordinate of the traps 
characterizing the type of its potential energy, a and b are the 
potential parameters, and A, Ω, and φ are the amplitude, 
frequency and the phase of the center of oscillations, 
respectively, D is the noise intensity, and the function ξ(t) 
denotes a zero-mean Gaussian white noise. 
A sub-circuit is used to calculate the switching threshold 
voltage and resistance of the resistive memory cell and its 
dependence on the sweep rate and operating temperature as it 
is described in [7].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The length of CFs in HfO2 was calculated to grow 
exponentially with time like it is shown in Figure 2a. The 
external bias determines the characteristic time of the 
growth. A significant increase of the growth rate is reached 
at the external bias of 2–2.5 V.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Dynamics of conductive filament growth in 5 nm HfO2 under 
various applied voltages (a). RRAM dynamics during pulse programming 
(5 V) at 300 K (b). 
 
 SPICE Modeling of the dynamics of the CFs growth in 
HfO2 during programming voltage pulse of 5 V that depends 
on the operating temperature shows that the RRAM cell does 
not switch on immediately. It takes approximately 4–6 ns. 
The switching event is determined by the sharp increase in 
the conductivity marked by the dotted line in Figure 2b. 
Switch-ON time depends exponentially of the external bias. 
This result shows an importance of the dynamic effects 
involving a range of transient processes. 
As for atomic mechanisms of ON/OFF switching of the 
FCs formed, oxygen and/or metal atom diffusion for the 
distances comparable to the FCs diameters (few nanometers) 
was calculated to proceed within milliseconds even at the 
melting point of HfO2.   
Modeling of electronic switching of bi-stable traps was 
carried out for HfO2 with the following parameters: the 
thermal ionization energy of the traps of 0.5 eV, the 
oscillation frequency of 10–12 GHz, the trap concentration 
of 1019 cm−3, and the noise intensity of 0.08–0.15. The 
bi-stable potential of the traps under an influence of a weak 
periodic modulation was confirmed to make a transition 
from one state to another only under the effect of the noise. 
Figure 3a shows that the impact of noise leads to the 
switching of the traps in HfO2 from one metastable state to 
another within few nanoseconds. An increasing intensity of 
the noise stimulates variations in the output signal y(t), 
causing formation of metastable states. The switching time 
decreases with an increase of the amplitude A and the impact 
frequency of the noise.

at different amplitudes noise amplitudes A (b). 
 
Numerical estimations of the electron switching time of 
the trapping states showed it to be of about few nanoseconds. 
It can decrease below 1 ns at relatively high amplitudes and 
intensities of the noise (Figure 3b). 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The performed modeling shows that comprehensive 
understanding  of the mechanisms of resistance switching in 
RRAM cells should include consideration of ion migration, 
the growth of conductive filaments and their rupture, as well 
as the capture and release of electrons including metastable 
trapping states. Experimental identification and numerical 
characterization of these states are important to increase 
operating frequencies of RRAMs.
