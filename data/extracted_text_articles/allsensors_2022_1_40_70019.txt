Abstract— This paper addresses the issues related to the 
Visible Light Communication (VLC) usage in vehicular 
communication applications. We propose a Visible Light 
Communication system based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle, Vehicle-
to-Infrastructure 
and 
Infrastructure-to-Vehicle 
communications able to safely manage vehicles crossing 
through an intersection. By using the streetlamps, street lights 
and traffic signaling to broadcast information, the connected 
vehicles interact with one another and with the infrastructure. 
Using joint transmission, mobile optical receivers collect data, 
calculate their location for positioning and, concomitantly, 
read the transmitted data from each transmitter. As receivers 
and decoders, optical sensors with light filtering properties, are 
used. Bidirectional communication between the infrastructure 
and the vehicles is tested. To command the passage of vehicles 
safely queue/request/response mechanisms and temporal/space 
relative pose concepts are used. The results show that the 
innovative solutions for congested intersections are related to 
the introduction of split intersections. The results indicate that 
the V-VLC system increases safety by directly monitoring 
critical points such as queue formation and dissipation, relative 
speed thresholds, as well as inter-vehicle spacing.

INTRODUCTION 
Vehicles can connect to others, or to the infrastructure, 
providing an Internet connection [1]. In this area, VLC have 
a great potential for applications due to their relatively 
simple design for basic functioning, efficiency, and large 
geographical distribution. 
The main objective of the Intelligent Transport System 
(ITS) technology is to optimize traffic safety and efficiency 
on public roads by increasing situation awareness and 
mitigating traffic accidents through vehicle-to-vehicle 
(V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications 
[2] [3] [4]. By knowing, in real time, the location, speed and 
direction of nearby vehicles, a considerable improvement in 
traffic management is expected. The goal is to increase the 
safety and throughput of traffic intersections using 
cooperative driving. Intersections, by their nature, easily 
become traffic bottlenecks and conflict areas because they 
usually cause considerable delays due to congestion 
problems. In the split intersection, the conventional four-
legged intersection is replaced by two separate lighter 
intersections which facilitate a smoother flow with less 
driver delay [5][6]. 
VLC is an emerging technology [7][ 8] that enables data 
communication by modulating information on the intensity 
of the light emitted by LEDs. In the case of vehicular 
communications, the use of VLC is made easier because all 
vehicles, street lights, and traffic lights are equipped with 
LEDs, 
using 
them 
for 
illumination. 
Here, 
the 
communication and localization is performed using the 
street lamps, the trafﬁc signaling and the head and tail 
lamps, enabling the dual use of exterior automotive and 
infrastructure 
lighting 
for 
both 
illumination 
and 
communication purposes [9][10]. 
Our work focuses directly on the use of VLC as a 
support for the transmission of information providing 
guidance services and specific information to drivers. A 
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) traffic scenario is simulated 
and bidirectional communication between the infrastructure 
and the vehicles is tested, using the VLC request/response 
concept. Every vehicle is equipped with a receiver module 
for receiving the mapped information generated from the 
street lamps. The receiver modules include a photodetector 
based on a tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light controlled 
filter [11][12] that multiplex the different optical channels, 
perform 
different 
filtering 
processes 
(amplification, 
switching, and wavelength conversion) and decode the 
encoded signals, recovering the transmitted information. 
Here, the streetlights and traffic lights, through VLC, report 
its geographical positions and specific information to the 
drivers since its infrastructure can also be reused to embed 
the edge/fog nodes in them. Cooperative localization is 
realized in a distributed way with the incorporation of the 
indirect V2V relative pose estimation method. The vehicle 
gathers relevant data from neighboring vehicles and

estimates the relative pose of them using the indirect V2V 
relative pose. 
This paper is organized as follows. After the 
introduction, in Section 2, the V-VLC system is described 
and the scenario, architecture, communication protocol, 
coding/decoding techniques analyzed. In Section 3, the 
experimental results are reported and the system evaluation 
performed. A phasing traffic flow diagram based on V-VLC 
is developed, as a Proof of Concept (PoC), to control the 
arrival of vehicles to the split intersection. Finally, in 
Section 4, the main conclusions are presented. 
II. 
V-VLC VEHICULAR COMMUNICATION  
While V2V links are particularly important for safety 
functionalities such as pre-crash sensing and forward 
collision warning, I2V links provide the connected vehicles 
with a variety of useful information [13] [14]. 
 
A. 
System Design 
The system is composed by two modules: the transmitter 
and the receiver located at the infrastructures and at the 
driving cars. The block diagram and the transmitter and 
receiver relative positions of the V-VLC system are 
presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Block diagram and transmitters and receivers 3D relative 
positions.  
Both communication modules are software defined, 
where modulation/ demodulation can be programed. In the 
transmission side, a modulation and conversion from digital 
to analog data is done. An On-Off Keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used to code the information [15] 
[16].The visible light emitted by the LEDs passes through 
the transmission medium and is received by the MUX 
device. White light tetra-chromatic sources are used 
providing a different data channel for each chip. Each 
luminaire is composed of four white LEDs framed at the 
corners of a square (see Figure 1). At each node, only one 
chip of the LED is modulated for data transmission, the Red 
(R: 626 nm), the Green (G: 530 nm), the Blue (B: 470 nm) 
or the Violet (V). Modulation and digital-to-analog 
conversion of the information bits is done using signal 
processing techniques.  
The coverage map for a square unit cell is displayed in 
Figure 2. The LEDs are modeled as Lambertian sources 
where the luminance is distributed uniformly in all 
directions, whereas the luminous intensity is different in all 
directions [17].

Figure 2. Illustration of the coverage map in the unit cell: footprint 
regions (#1-#9) and steering angle codes (2-9). 
The input of the aided guidance system is the coded 
signal sent by the transmitters to an identify vehicle, and 
includes its position in the network P(x, y), inside the unit 
cell and the steering angle, , that guides the driver across 
his path. The device receives multiple signals, finds the 
centroid of the received coordinates, and stores it as the 
reference point position. Nine reference points, for each unit 
cell, are identified giving a fine-grained resolution in the 
localization of the mobile device across each cell (see 
Figure 2). The VLC photosensitive receiver is a double 
pin/pin photodetector based on a tandem heterostructure, p-
i'-n/p-i-n sandwiched between two conductive transparent 
contacts. Exposed to light, the device offers high sensitivity 
and linear response, generating a proportional electrical 
current.  
 
B. 
Architecture, Scenario and Multi-Vehicle Cooperative 
Localization   
In Figure 3a, the proposed architecture is illustrated. 
Under this architecture, the short-range mesh network 
purpose is twofold: enable edge computing and device-to-
cloud communication, by ensuring a secure communication 
from a luminaire controller to the edge computer or 
datacenter (I2IM), through a neighbor traffic light controller 
with an active cellular connection; and enable peer-to-peer 
communication (I2I), to exchange information. It performs 
much of the processing on embedded computing platforms, 
directly interfacing to sensors and controllers. It supports 
geo-distribution, local decision making, and real-time load-
balancing.

A highly congested traffic scenario will be strongly 
connected. In order to determine the delay, the number of 
vehicles queuing in each cell at the beginning and end of the 
green time is determined by V2V2I observation, as 
illustrated in Figure 3b. Based on a truncated exponential 
distribution the distance, d between vehicles is calculated

Figure 4. Simulated scenario. V2X optical infrastructure and generated 
joint footprints in a split crossroad (LED array=RGBV color spots).  
The simulated scenario is a traffic light controlled split 
intersection as displayed in Figure 4. The grid size was 
chosen in order to avoid an overlap in the receiver from the 
data in adjacent grid points. Each transmitter, X i,j, carries its 
own color, X, (RGBV) as well as its horizontal and vertical 
ID position in the surrounding network (i,j). In the PoC, was 
assumed that the split crossroad is located in the 
intersections of line 4 with column 3 and 7 (see Figure 4). 
The emitters are located at the nodes along the roadside. 
Thus, each LED sends a I2V message that includes the 
synchronism, its physical ID and the traffic information. 
When a probe vehicle enters the streetlight´s capture range, 
the receiver replies to the light signal, and assigns a unique 
ID and the traffic message [16]. 
Figure 4 illustrates the split intersection, which has only 
one main street connecting two crossroads (Intersection 1-
Intersection 2). Four traffic flows were considered. One is 
coming from West (W) with three vehicles (a, c, d) 
approaching the crossroad, Vehicle a with straight 
movement and Vehicle c and Vehicle d with left turn only. 
In the second flow, Vehicle b from East (E), approaches the 
intersection with left turn only. In the third flow, Vehicle e, 
oncoming from South (S), has e right-turn approach. 
Finally, in the fourth flow, Vehicle f, coming from North, 
goes straight. 
For the intersection manager crossing coordination, the 
vehicle and the IM exchange information through two types 
of messages, “request” (V2I) and “response” (I2V). Each 
driver, approaching the intersection area from each queue 
side has previously selected and stays in the appropriate lane 
for their destination (left turn only or shared by right-turn 
and through movements). Inside the request distance, an 
approach “request” is sent, using as emitter the headlights.  
The request message is received and decoded by the 
receiver in the traffic light facing the lane (local controller) 
which is interconnected to the intersection manager (V2I). 
The “request” contains all the information that is necessary 
for a vehicle’s space-time reservation for its intersection 
crossing (speeds, and flow directions). Intersection manager 
uses this information to convert it in a sequence of timed 
rectangular spaces that each assigned vehicle needs to 
occupy the intersection. 
An intersection 
manager’s 
acknowledge is sent from the traffic signal over the facing 
receiver to the in car application of the head vehicle. Once 
the response is received (message distance in Figure 3b), the 
vehicle is required to follow the provided occupancy 
trajectories (footprint regions, see Figure 2). If a request has 
any potential risk of collision with all other vehicles that 
have already been approved to cross the intersection, the 
control manager only sends back to the vehicle (V2I) the 
“response” after the risk of conflict is exceeded.  
There are critical points where traffic conditions change: 
the point at which a vehicle begins to decelerate when the 
traffic light turns red (message distance), the point at which 
it stops and joins the queue (queue distance), the point at 
which it starts to accelerate when the traffic light turns green 
(request distance) or the points at which the coming vehicle 
is slowed by the leaving vehicle. As a result, the road 
resistances can be calculated dynamically based on the 
relative pose positions of the vehicles and the traffic signal 
phase at intersections. With V2I2V communication, the 
travel time that influences traffic channelization in different

routes can be calculated and real-time data about speed, 
spacing, queues, and saturation can be collected across the 
queue, request and message distances.Three types of 
information qi (t), qi (t,t´) and qij (t) compose the basic 
elements of a pose graph for multi-vehicle cooperative 
localization, t and t’ are the request and cross times From a 
digital map we automatically extract a set of attributes that 
characterize an intersection: the poses, qi (x, y, t), the 
courses and traffic rules (stop, give way) [19, 20 ]. An 
Indirect V2V Relative Pose Estimation method is proposed 
in Figure 3b. Here, when two vehicles are in neighborhood, 
the geometric relationship between them can be indirectly 
inferred via a chain of geometric relationships among both 
vehicles’ positions and local maps. The follower vehicle can 
be localized by itself, as in single vehicle localization, qi (t), 
and can also be localized by combining the localization 
result of vehicle leader and the relative localization estimate 
between the two vehicles, qij (t). For a vehicle with several 
neighboring vehicles, it uses the indirect V2V relative pose 
estimation method to estimate the relative pose of each 
neighboring vehicle one by one.  
In Figure 5, a color phasing diagram in split intersection 
is shown. We have assumed four “color poses” linked with 
the radial range of the modulated light in the RGBV 
crossroad nodes [20].

On the basis of the proposed phasing diagram, a phase 
for vulnerable road users (VRU’s) only, as well as the 
separation of traffic flow in the North / South direction, 
allows the introduction of bike lanes at Intersection 1 (South 
and East straight movements) and Intersection 2 (North 
straight movements), reducing conflicts between vehicles 
and cyclists. The West straight, South left turn and West 
right turn maneuvers correspond to the ”Green poses”. “Red 
poses” are related with South straight, East left turn and 
South right turn maneuvers, “Blue poses” with East straight, 
North left turn and East right turn and finally “violet poses” 
with North straight, West left turn and North right turn 
maneuvers.  
 
C. 
Communication 
Protocol 
and 
Coding/Decoding 
Techniques 
To code the information, an On-Off keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used and it was considered a 
synchronous transmission based on a 64- bits data frame. 
The frame is divided into four, if the transmitter is a 
streetlamp or headlamp, or five blocks, if the transmitter is 
the traffic light. The first block is the synchronization block 
[10101], the last is the payload data (traffic message) and a 
stop bit ends the frame. The second block, the ID block 
gives the location (x, y coordinates) of the emitters inside 
the array (Xi,j,). Cell’s IDs are encoded using a 4 bits binary 
representation for the decimal number. The  block (steering 
angle ()) completes the pose in a frame time q(x,y, , t). 
Eight steering angles along the cardinal points and coded 
with the same number of the footprints in the unit cell 
(Figure 2) are possible from a start point to the next goal. If 
the message is diffused by the IM transmitter, a pattern 
[0000] follows this identification, if it is a request (R) a 
pattern [00] is used. The traffic message completes the 
frame. 
Because the VLC has four independent emitters, the 
optical signal generated in the receiver can have one, two, 
three, or even four optical excitations, resulting in 24 
different optical combinations and 16 different photocurrent 
levels at the photodetector. As an example, in Figure 6, the 
V2I MUX signals received and decode (on the top of the 
figures) is displayed for the split intersection. In the right 
side, the received channels are identified by its 4-digit 
binary codes and associated positions in the unit cell. On the 
top the transmitted channels packets [R, G, B, V] are 
decoded. In accordance with Figures 2 and 3, results show a 
request from vehicle a, when crossing Intersection 2 (Green 
pose; #2E: R3,6 G3,7, B 4,6  (3)) under Phase 1.

Vehicle a, pose #2E, and vehicle b, pose #7W). b) Vehicle c, poses  #7NE, 
#1NE.  
Results show that, as the receiver moves between 
generated point regions, the received information pattern 
changes. Taking into account Figure 4 and Figure 6, Vehicle 
a, driving the right lane enters the response distance by #2 
(t´a, Phase1, green pose), goes straight to E. Then, this 
vehicle enters the crossroad through  #8 (t´´a) and leaves it 
in the exit #2 at t´´´a , as displayed in the figure, keeping 
always the same direction (E). Vehicle b after crossing 
Intersection 2, approaches the Intersection 1, asked 
permission to cross it (tb) and receives authorization when 
the vehicle a left the intersection (end of Phase 2, t’’’a). 
Then, Phase 3 begins with vehicle b heading to the 
intersection (W) (pose red) while vehicle a follows it 
destination towards E (green pose). In Figure 7b, signal 
responses and the assigned decoded messages from vehicle 
c inside the intersection are displayed at t’’c and t’’’c.  Data 
shows that vehicle c, driving in the in the left lane, receives 
order to enter the intersection in # 7, turning left (NE) and 
keeps moving in this direction across position #1 toward the 
North exit (Phase 2, violet pose). 
In both intersections, before the request of vehicle d to 
cross Intersection 1, the IM is aware through the request 
made by its leader c that a follower is approaching (d). 
Three actions must be taken to promote smooth movement 
avoiding congestions and delays: changing the synchronism 
of intersection 2, delaying the passage of vehicles b and 
finally, allowing the joint passage of vehicles b and d at 
Intersection 1 in the same phase (Phase 3). 
Based on the simulated traffic scenario (Figure 4) and 
using the concept of V-VLC queue/request/response 
messages (Figure 3) a phasing diagram was drawn and 
reported in Figure 8.

representation is assigned a unique time to enter the 
intersection, t[x]. According to the phasing diagram (Figure 
3), in Figure 8, the phasing flow for the split intersection is 
visualized: Intersection 1: Phases 0, pedestrian/bicyclist

Phase 4. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Using V-VLC-ready connected cars, we propose a 
queue/request/response 
approach 
for 
managing 
split 
intersections. A communication scenario is stablished and a 
“mesh/cellular” hybrid network configuration proposed. As 
a PoC, a phasing of traffic flows is suggested. In this study, 
the vehicles' arrival is controlled and they are scheduled to 
cross intersections at predetermined times to minimize 
traffic delays. V2I2V communication provides real-time 
data on queues, requests, and messages distances, including 
queue, request, and message travel times that influence 
traffic channeling in various routes. Compared with radio 
transceivers and directional antennas used in connected cars, 
visible light provides more accurate distance and position 
measurement thanks to its high directivity. Based on the 
simulated/experimental 
results, 
the 
proposed 
VLC 
cooperative architecture appears to be appropriate for the 
intended applications. The introduction of VLC between 
connected vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure 
allows the direct monitoring of critical points that are related 
to the queue formation and dissipation, relative speed 
thresholds and inter-vehicle spacing increasing the safety.
