Abstract—Western languages do not dispose of a well elaborated
vocabulary for describing smell and ﬂavour sensations. We
investigate whether beer experts share a common vocabulary
to describe beer properties. We collected an English text cor-
pus of beer reviews and analyzed the lexical descriptors used
by beer-tasting experts to describe aromas and ﬂavours. The
informativeness of beer reviews was investigated by running a
machine learning experiment for predicting the colour of a beer
based on the review text. This preliminary experiment shows
promising results, with average accuracy ﬁgures of about 60%
for automatic beer colour prediction. Our experimental results
show that beer experts share a common vocabulary to describe
beer characteristics in a consistent way, allowing to automatically
predict beer properties based on the review text.

INTRODUCTION
It appears that people in the western world are not very
good at describing smells and ﬂavours. Research has shown
that western languages have few words to describe smells
and ﬂavours, in contrast to visual phenomena, for which we
dispose of a well elaborated vocabulary [1]. The description
of taste, smell, and sight remains evaluative and non-speciﬁc
for non-experts as [2] has shown in studies conducted with
wine experts, coffee experts, and novices. Both coffee and
wine experts tend to use more speciﬁc source-based terms
(metaphors or it smells like + source), while novices use more
evaluative terms (e.g., nice, bad, good). Consequently, we can
assume that reviews written by beer experts should contain
more source-based descriptions and fewer evaluative terms in
order to describe smell, taste, and sight.
Previous research has shown that the perception of foods
and drinks depend on both the visual and orthonasal sensory
inputs, especially before the tasting [3]. The colour and look
of a drink inﬂuence both the perception of smell and the
way the taster describes his/her perceptions [4]. Furthermore,
people link certain smells with certain colours [5]. It can
therefore be concluded that perceptions of sight are closely
related to perceptions of smell. Consequently, certain sight
descriptions in the reviews will often be accompanied by the
same smell descriptions and certain smell descriptions will be
accompanied by the same sight descriptions. For this reason,
an automatic prediction system could predict missing sight
properties based on the smell descriptions in the reviews it
is often accompanied by, and vice versa. For example, “gold”
could refer to the colour of a beer, and in the corpus, reviews
about light-coloured beer often contain the words herbs, spicy,
and butter to describe the aroma of that beer. Therefore, an
automatic prediction system could predict the colour of the
beer in a review, which lacks sight or colour descriptions, based
solely on the aroma description. Such a system could tell if a
beer is gold even though the reviewer does not mention any
colour or sight property.
Not only descriptions of smell and sight, but also de-
scriptions of smell and taste/ﬂavour are claimed to be closely
connected. According to [6], the ﬂavour of food is described by
both gustatory and olfactory stimuli. There are two olfactory
stimuli: orthonasal smell and retronasal smell, which are
respectively the smell we sniff before the food or drink is tasted
and the smell that is pulsed out after the food or drink had
been swallowed. It is the combination of retronasal aromas and
gustatory cues that deﬁnes a ﬂavour and leads to descriptions
such as fruity and malty [6]. In [7], the authors consider odour-
taste synaesthesia (smelling tastes/tasting smells) a factor of
the link between smell and taste. When people smell an odour,
they recognize the smell as a taste and describe it as such, e.g.,
something smells sweet. This is also due to the co-occurrence
of retronasal odour simulation and oral stimulation and the
result of a unitary perception [7].
For this research, we have compiled a corpus of American
beer reviews (See Section II). Our hypothesis is that the
reviewers working for this website will be subject to odour-
taste synaesthesia and describe ﬂavours and aromas as such.
As a consequence, certain smell descriptions in the reviews
should often be accompanied by the same taste descriptions
and vice versa.
This leads us to our ﬁrst research question (RQ1): is it
indeed the case that taste and smell descriptions are closely
linked, and do beer reviewers, by consequence, use the same
lexical descriptors for taste and smell?
The second research question (RQ2) is the following: are
the expert beer reviews meaningful providers of information
considering the limited vocabulary and ways of describing
sensory perceptions such as smells, ﬂavours, and sight? There-
fore, sensory experiences should be worded in a consistent
manner.In [8], the authors have shown this is the case for
authors of wine reviews. They built classiﬁers to predict colour,
grape variety, country of origin, and price of a wine, based on
the experts’ wine reviews. The experimental results showed
promising F-scores, demonstrating that wine reviews really are
informative.
In this research, we investigate whether beer experts share
a common vocabulary to describe beer properties. The consis-
tency of the descriptions will be veriﬁed by building a machine
learning system to automatically predict beer properties for
new beer reviews on the basis of smell/aroma and taste/ﬂavour
descriptions from experts’ reviews. For these preliminary ex-
periments, we build a system that predicts beer colour labels
on the sole basis of smell and taste properties. This means
that the system can assign colour properties to the beer in
25

the review even though colour descriptions are lacking. The
automatic prediction system then bases its colour property
predictions on the smell and taste descriptions present in the
review. The general hypothesis is then that beer experts, just
like wine experts, are capable of describing beer properties in a
sufﬁciently consistent manner, which allows beer properties to
be automatically predicted on the basis of experts’ reviews.
Training automatic systems to predict beer characteristics
could be a ﬁrst step to develop content-based recommender
systems for beer. Whereas current recommender systems only
take metadata like beer style (e.g., IPA) and user-based ﬁltering
or subjective ratings into account, beer recommendations based
on review content and aroma and taste descriptions could be
very useful.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tion II describes the beer review corpus we used for these
experiments. Section III elaborates on the colour classiﬁcation
experiments for automatic prediction of colour based on smell
and taste descriptions in the reviews (RQ2), while Section IV
presents the lexical analysis of the language that is used for
describing smell and taste in beer reviews (RQ1). Finally, in
Section V, we draw conclusions and present prospects for
future research.

CORPUS
For our experiments, a corpus of online beer reviews
written by experts is composed. Experts are widely considered
to be more accurate and detailed in their smell, taste and
sight descriptions, which is important for the construction of
an automatic prediction system. In [9], the author claims that
experts are biologically superior to novices when it comes to
distinguishing tastes.
We have collected 2205 beer reviews from the American
website Tastings.com [10] and automatically extracted per re-
view the following structured beer properties: name, category,
alcohol, country, style, aroma, ﬂavor, bitterness, as well as the
review text written by the expert. Figure 1 shows an example
of the structured beer properties that are listed for the different
beers.

Example 1 lists the review text accompanying the structured
properties of the Westmalle Trappist Double beer:
(1)
Hypnotic reddish mahogany color. Rich aromas of
toasted banana-raisin mufﬁn and spicy vanilla custard
with a satiny, fruity-yet-dry medium-full body and a
long, elegant ﬁnish with notes of caramelized nuts and
dried fruits, peppery spice, and earth. A fantastic ﬂavor
ride and an archetype of the style.

CLASSIFICATION EXPERIMENTS
The task of predicting the colour of the beer was conceived
as a supervised classiﬁcation task. Two sets of bag-of-words
features were extracted as information sources from the expert
review texts: unigrams (single words) and bigrams (sequences
of two words). As we want to investigate the viability of
automatically predicting the colour of the beer based on the
sole review text, sentences containing a colour description
were automatically removed from the review. The reviews were
further preprocessed by removing all punctuation marks and
by lower-casing all words contained in the review.
Unlike the other beer properties, colour descriptions could
not be automatically extracted from the website, because
they were only present in the written review itself and not
in the structured information about the beer in the website.
Therefore, the word preceding the word colour in the review
was extracted as the colour description. If the review contains
for instance Cloudy golden color with a high head, the word
preceding color, being golden in this case, is automatically
extracted as the colour label and the entire sentence is removed
from the review text. Altogether, 49 different colour labels
were extracted following this procedure. This high number of
classes, however, makes the colour classiﬁcation of beers from
new reviews less accurate. Therefore, colour terms referring
to the same colour category were grouped together and 7 new
classes were formed (very light, yellow, amber, brown, black,
red/rose, and green). Other colour terms could not be grouped
within these classes, and were kept as individual colour classes.
This was the case for the colours: deep, hazy, cloudy, and oak.
Some of the latter colour labels do not refer to a speciﬁc colour,
but are artifacts introduced by the automatic extraction of the
label. For the experiments, colour labels only occurring once
in the corpus were not considered (brilliant, violet, indigo,
gray, platinum, nickel, wood). This way we ended up with
11 different colour categories or classes, which are shown in
Table I. Beer reviews where no colour label could be extracted,
were removed from the database, resulting in a reduction of
the corpus from 2205 to 2121 instances.

As a classiﬁcation algorithm, we used Support Vector

evaluation measures, we report (ten-fold cross-validated) (1)

Precision, (2) Recall and (3) F1-score per colour class, calcu-
lated as follows:
Precision = Number of correctly predicted labels
Total number of predicted labels
(1)
Recall = Number of correctly predicted labels
Total number of gold standard labels
(2)
F − score = 2(Precision ∗ Recall)
Precision + Recall
(3)
In addition, we report accuracy, which simply divides the
number of true predictions (both positive and negative class)
by the total number of instances of the complete data set.
The scores for colour labels occurring in less than 5 training
instances are not reported in the results. Due to lack of
sufﬁcient training data, these rare labels are never predicted
by the classiﬁer (and thus result in 0% performance for all
evaluation measures).
A. Experimental results
For the presented colour prediction experiments, LIBSVM
was applied with two different kernels. The ﬁrst experiment
was run with the linear kernel of LIBSVM, resulting in an
average cross-validation accuracy of 56.05%. For the second
experiment, the default (RBF) kernel was optimised by means
of a grid search on one training fold, resulting in an optimised c
parameter value of 2.0 and an optimised g parameter value of
0.0078125. This second experimental setup yielded the best
results, with an average accuracy of 59.88%. We compared
these results to two classiﬁcation baselines: (1) a majority
baseline predicting the most frequent class for all instances,
being amber and (2) a random baseline predicting labels
uniformly at random. Table II shows the results of the two
baselines and the two variations of our colour prediction
system.

Table III presents the detailed results per individual colour
class for the ﬁrst experiment, while Table IV reports the results
for the optimized classiﬁer. As can be noticed, the F-scores
for the more frequent classes (i.e., yellow, amber, brown) are
higher in the optimised version, but the performance of black,
which has 148 training instances, drops considerably (from
35.9% to 20.9% F-score). A second observation that can be
made is that colour labels with few training instances are
never predicted by the classiﬁer, resulting in an F-score of
0%. Hence, to improve the prediction accuracy for all colour
classes, more training data need to be collected to have a
more balanced corpus. In future research, we will investigate
alternative experimental set-ups, including an ensemble of
binary classiﬁers trained for each colour separately.
In addition, a shallow qualitative analysis revealed that the
classiﬁer is often confused between the colour labels amber,
gold, brown and black. The confusion matrix for amber, for

This can be explained by the fact that the different varia-
tions of these colours present a continuum, rather than a clear-
cut distinction (“pale amber” resembles “deep gold”, “amber
brown” resembles “brown” and “deep brown” is very similar
to “black” in reality). As a result, one can assume that the beer
experts are not 100% consistent in naming these similar beer
colours and might use similar lexical descriptors in the review
text for colour variations that are alike.
B. Most informative lexical descriptors for colour
To gain insight in which n-grams are most characterizing
of colour-labelled dataset, we performed Mutual Information
(MI) feature scoring. Feature selection ﬁlter metrics, such
as MI, can be used to characterize both the relevance and
redundancy of variables [12]. The mutual information between
two random variables is a non-negative value which measures
the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero
if and only if two random variables are independent, and
higher values mean higher dependency. We used the MI
implementation in the Scikit-learn toolkit [13] which relies
on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation from
k-nearest neighbors distances as described in [14] (k = 3).
We used the MI-score ranking as an approximation of
most characterizing features for the target colour labels in
which higher MI-scores are more dependent on the 11 colour
target classes. The vast majority (81.11%) of the n-grams

over the 90th percentile of scores (P90 = 5.85e-3, n = 254)
pertain unambiguously to smell or odour semantic classes.
This shows that the most characteristic n-grams for the colour
labels largely pertain to semantic classes of smell and odour.
As illustration of this conclusion, Table VI gives an overview
of the 20 highest ranked MI descriptors.
IV.
LEXICAL DESCRIPTORS FOR TASTE SMELL
In the introduction, it was hypothesized that beer reviewers
are subject to odour-taste synaesthesia and by consequence
use the same lexical descriptors for taste and smell. To verify
this premise, a corpus analysis was performed for the lexical
descriptors used in the structured “aroma” and “ﬂavor” labels
and a frequency list of all lexical descriptors assigned to both
categories was compiled. The full aroma frequency ranking
consists of 3121 terms, of which 1993 are unique terms
(63.86% of the aroma corpus) and the full ﬂavour ranking
contains 2466 terms, of which 1456 unique terms for ﬂavour
description (59.04% of the ﬂavour corpus). Figure 2 illustrates,
however, a rapid stagnation of both lines starting from the top-
500 most frequently used terms. A closer examination reveals
that indeed, in the aroma ranking, 1832 terms are only used
once, 389 twice and 189 three times in the entire training
corpus. In the ﬂavour ranking, 1416 terms are only used once,
310 twice and 160 three times. These are terms that are rather
uncommon for describing both aroma and ﬂavour.
Figure 2. Distribution of unique terms for aroma and ﬂavor labels.
Table VII lists the number of unique aroma and ﬂavour
terms (and their corresponding percentage of the respective
aroma and ﬂavour corpus). The ten most frequently used terms
to describe smell properties (i.e., aroma) are also used to
describe taste properties, which means that none of these terms
are unique for aroma description. Only one term (roasted nuts)
is unique in the top 25 and even top 50 most frequently used
terms in the aroma ranking. In its top 100 most frequently used
terms, only two terms (roasted nuts and danish) are unique for
aroma description. For the description of taste properties (i.e.,
ﬂavour) only one term (tangy) in the top 10 and top 25 most
frequently used terms is unique. Two terms (tangy and grassy)
are unique in the top 50 of the ﬂavour ranking and in its top
100, ﬁve terms (tangy, grassy, driven, radish sprouts and bitter
greens) are solely used for the description of ﬂavour.

The low number of unique terms for both aroma and
ﬂavour descriptions conﬁrm our initial hypothesis of odour-
taste synaesthesia [7], which states that people recognise and
describe aromas and ﬂavours, respectively smell and taste
properties, similarly. The fact that all 10 most frequently used
terms for aroma description are present in the top 100 most
frequently used terms for ﬂavour description and that only two
of the top 10 most frequently used terms for ﬂavour description
are unique, shows that indeed many lexical descriptors are used
for both aroma and ﬂavour descriptions.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents preliminary research investigating the
sensory descriptors used by expert beer reviewers. The per-
formed lexical analysis conﬁrms the odour-taste synaesthesia
hypothesis, as the most frequently used descriptors are shown
to be used for describing both aroma and ﬂavour properties of
beers.
In addition, we wanted to examine whether expert beer
reviewers succeed at describing sensory experiences in a
consistent manner. To this goal, we conducted a machine
learning experiment aiming at automatically predicting beer
properties, being the colour of the beer for the present research.
By relying on the fact that perceptions of sight are closely
related to perceptions of smell and ﬂavour, consistency of the
beer property descriptions has been shown, because the review
text was the sole information source used in colour prediction.
Our classiﬁcation experiment showed promising results, with
an average accuracy score of about 60%. Analysis of the re-
sults, however, revealed that the classiﬁer was only successful
at predicting the most frequent colour classes. Moreover, a
statistical analysis by means of Mutual Information showed
that the most informative review terms for colour prediction
largely pertain to the semantic classes of smell and odour.
In future research, we want to collect more data in order to
have a more balanced corpus and start collecting data for other
languages as well. This way, we can carry out multilingual

analyses of the lexical descriptors that are used to express smell
and taste sensations. In addition, we will add more advanced
(semantic and syntactic) features to improve the classiﬁcation
accuracy and perform experiments aiming at predicting other
beer properties in an automated way.
