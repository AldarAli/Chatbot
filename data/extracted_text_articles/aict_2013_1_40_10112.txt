Abstract— This paper describes an application of Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT) spreading to Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless LAN (WLAN)
to reduce Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) for energy
efficiency improvement and to maintain robustness to DC
offset error for cost-effective hardware implementation. We
call our proposed scheme null DC sub-carrier DFT spreading
OFDM, where the DC sub-carrier is made null by splitting the
spectrum in the frequency domain after DFT spreading of the
modulated signals. The computer simulation results confirm
that BER performance is not degraded due to DC offset error
at the transmitter and/or the receiver like OFDM with null DC
sub-carrier and its PAPR is lower than OFDM, and is almost
the same as the conventional DFT spreading OFDM.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been widely
accepted as a means of broadband wireless access to Internet
and have been deployed in various environments such as
home, campus and office. According to the increasing
demand for mobile/nomadic access to the Internet services,
hot
spot
services
based
on
IEEE802.11a/g/n
WLAN
standards using 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands are becoming more
and more popular in these days to off-load the cellular traffic
to WLANs, since most of all mobile personal computers
(PCs)
and
smart
phone
devices have
WLAN
access
capability. In order to increase the bit rate and throughput of
WLAN, IEEE802.11ac/ad are being standardized aiming at
multi Gbps broadband access and IEEE802.11ah using UHF
band such as 700MHz and 900MHz bands is also being
standardized for cellular traffic offload applications and
wireless sensor network applications [1]-[3].
As
well
known,
orthogonal
frequency
division
multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted in IEEE802.11a/g/n and
will be used in IEEE802.11ac/ad as well due to its robustness
to
the
severe
frequency
selective
fading
in
mobile
environments.
OFDM
shows
excellent
transmission
performance under severe multi-path fading in mobile
environments however the weak point of OFDM is its higher
peak to average power ration (PAPR) than that of the
conventional single carrier modulation scheme. This high
PAPR can be a burden for battery-operated mobile terminal
implementation
because
large
output
back-off
(OBO)
required in high power amplifier (HPA) could result in large
power consumption. Therefore, IEEE802.11ad specification
has an alternative PHY of single carrier modulation in
addition to OFDM [1]. For the same reasons, discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) spreading OFDM based single carrier-
frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) has been
adopted for the uplink transmission, i.e., from the mobile
terminal to the base station, in 3GPP-LTE [4]. As DFT
spreading OFDM (DFTs-OFDM herein after) is essentially a
single carrier modulation based block transmission scheme,
lower PAPR than OFDM can be achieved [5]. In addition, its
power
spectrum
is
as
compact
as
that
of
OFDM.
Furthermore, its robustness to the frequency selective fading
is also equivalent to OFDM since cyclic prefix (CP) is
introduced to avoid the inter-symbol interference due to
frequency selective fading [6].
On the other hand, OFDM has another advantage of its
robustness to DC offset error for cost-effective hardware
implementation, i.e., precise DC offset adjustment is not
required at modulator and demodulator since DC sub-carrier
is made null in the OFDM based WLAN standards. For
example, IEEE802.11a standard uses 52 sub-carriers based
on 64 point FFT/IFFT, where DC sub-carrier is not used
because BER performance of the DC sub-carrier can be
significantly degraded due to DC offset error between D/A
converter and I/Q modulator and/or that between I/Q
demodulator and A/D converter. Therefore, null DC sub-
carrier in OFDM is an important feature of OFDM for cost-
effective hardware implementation in WLAN. As mentioned
above, DFTs-OFDM is a promising solution to reduce PAPR,
however we need to maintain the robustness to DC offset
error when we apply DFT spreading to OFDM based WLAN.
In order to solve the above-mentioned problem for the
application of DFT spreading to OFDM based WLAN, this
paper proposes spectrum splitting after DFT spreading to
make DC subcarrier null. In this paper, this new type of
DFTs-OFDM is called a null DC sub-carrier DFTs-OFDM,
which can achieve both advantages of low PAPR and
robustness to DC offset error.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes
the principle of the proposed null DC sub-carrier DFTs-
OFDM
(NDCS-DFTs-OFDM,
hereinafter),
Section
III
shows the performance evaluation results of NDCS-DFTs-

PRINCIPLE OF NDCS-DFTS-OFDM
A.
Configulation of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
The block diagram of the proposed NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
is shown in Fig. 1, where Fig.1 (a) shows the transmitter side
and Fig.1 (b) shows the receiver side.
As shown in Fig.1 (a), the input data is converted from
serial data to M symbols of parallel data, by which M sub-
carriers are modulated. M points DFT spreading (pre-coding)
is performed for M modulated sub-carriers. Then, M points
of DFT spread modulated signals are fed to N points IFFT
processor to generate OFDM signals, where N is set at power
of two to employ FFT algorithm for reducing signal
processing complexity. We assume M is an even number and
M<N. In the input of IFFT, M point data are divided into two
groups and M/2 point data are fed to the upper frequency part
of IFFT processor input and the other M/2 point data are fed
to the lower frequency part of IFFT processor input. DC
component of the modulated signals is not transmitted by DC
sub-carrier, but another sub-carrier. DC sub-carrier with
frequency=0 is not used and null data is set at DC sub-carrier
in the OFDM signals to avoid the BER performance
degradation due to DC offset error. As the DFT spread
modulated signals are divided to two parts, PAPR is
expected to be slightly larger than that of the conventional
DFTs-OFDM due to the insertion of null at DC sub-carrier,
but it will be much smaller than that of OFDM. As DC sub-
carrier is made null, the modulated signals are not affected
by DC offset error between D/A converters and I/Q
modulator.

where
the
output
of
the
I/Q
demodulator output is fed to A/D converters and CP is
removed. As the received signal has no DC component, DC
offset error between I/Q demodulator and A/D converters
does not affect BER performance. This feature is essentially
the same as the OFDM, which does not use DC sub-carrier.
After A/D conversion, the received signals are fed to N point
FFT and converted to frequency domain signals, where M/2
point data at the upper frequency part and the other M/2
point data at the lower frequency part are combined to the
original modulated signals after DFT spreading at the
transmitter, where DC sub-carrier is discarded. M point DFT
spreading OFDM signals are fed to M point IDFT processor
after frequency domain equalization (FDE). The output of
the IDFT processor is demodulated on a sub-carrier by sub-
carrier basis.
B.
Mathematical expressions of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
Mathematical expressions of the proposed NDCS-DFTs-
OFDM based on the block diagram shown in Fig. 1 are given
here.
Let us consider the transmitter side first. We assume that
the size of DFT and IDFT is M where M is an even number.
Supposing that the complex envelop of the modulated signal
is s(n) (n=0~M-1), discrete Fourier transform of s(n), S(k)
(k=0~M-1) is given by

Note that DM performs M point DFT spreading to convert the
time domain signal, s(n) (n=0~M-1) to the frequency domain
signal, S(k) (k=0~M-1). S(0)~S(M-1) are fed to N point IFFT
processor, where N is power of two. IFFT converts the
frequency domain signals, S(0)~S(M-1) to the time domain
signals, T(n) (n=0~N-1), as shown below:

The multiplication of DN
H means IFFT processing. After
IFFT, CP is added and transmitted like the conventional
DFTs-OFDM.
Note that zero is inserted at the first row of the input of
FFT processor as shown in equation (4). This means the DC
sub-carrier is made null. The frequency domain signals are
split into two parts, i.e., S(0)~S(M/2-1) and S(M/2)~S(M-1).
Therefore, the output of IFFT processor is not a pure single
carrier modulation signal and DC component, S(0) is
transmitted via sub-carrier with frequency=1/N instead of
frequency=0. Thus, PAPR could be slightly larger than that
of the conventional DFTs-OFDM.
Let us consider the receiver side next. Supposing that the
complex envelop of the received signal at the FFT processor
input is g(n) (n=0~N-1), the output of FFT processor, G(k)
(k=0~N-1) is given by:

signals,
G(k).
Supposing
that

Application of DFT spreading to OFDM-based WLAN
As shown in Fig. 1 (a), all of the functional blocks except
M
point
DFT
processor
in
the
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
transmitter
are
included
in
IEEE802.11n/ac
OFDM
transmitter. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(b), all of the
functional blocks except M point IDFT processor in the
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
receiver
are
also
included
in
IEEE802.11n/ac OFDM receiver.
Furthermore, all of the
sub-carriers used in the proposed NDCS-DFTs-OFDM are
exactly the same as those of conventional IEEE802.11n/ac,
thus the preamble format used in IEEE802.11n/ac WLAN
can be re-used and do not need to be changed at all. In
addition, we can expect the same robustness against DC
offset error as IEEE802.11n/ac OFDM.
D.
Additional signal processing complexity
Additional signal processing complexity needs to be
evaluated when the proposed NDCS-DFTs-OFDM is applied
to OFDM based WLAN. Signal processing complexity of
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM is essentially the same as that of
conventional DFTs-OFDM. If M is power of two, we can
employ FFT algorithm to reduce the number of complex
multiplication for DFT. However, when we assume the
existing parameters of IEEE802.11n/ac WLAN, the number
of sub-carriers, M is 56 and the FFT size, N is 64 for
20MHz band operation of IEEE802.11n/ac. Table I shows
the comparison of signal processing complexity by the
number of complex multiplications of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
and OFDM. FFT algorithm can reduce 642 complex
multiplications to 192 for 64 points DFT. On the other hand,
PFA (Prime Factor FFT algorithm) can be applied for 56
points DFT to reduce the signal processing complexity [7].
PFA can reduce 562 complex multiplications to 476 for 56
points DFT. Therefore, the total number of complex
multiplications required for NDCS-DFTs-OFDM is 668 at
the transmitter as shown in Table I. The signal processing
complexity of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM is about 3.5 times larger

than that of OFDM. This is a trade-off issue between the
additional power consumption for DFT spreading in NDCS-
DFTs-OFDM and the power consumption due to large OBO
of HPA in OFDM. Considering that Moore’s law is still
effective, NDCS-DFTs-OFDM seems promising to improve
energy efficiency of OFDM based WLAN in near future.
In IEEE802.11ah using UHF band, 1/10 clock down
operation of IEEE802.11ac OFDM is proposed. In this case,
power consumption of OFDM modem is essentially 1/10
compared with that of IEEE802.11n/ac and additional signal
processing complexity will not be a significant problem.
Therefore, NDCS-DFTs-OFDM will be useful for energy
efficiency improvement.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A.
Simulation parameters
PAPR, power spectrum, BER performance and EVM of
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM are evaluated by computer simulation
and are compared with those of OFDM and DFTs-OFDM.
Major simulation parameters are shown in Table II, where
the number of sub-carriers and FFT/IFFT size are the same
as those of IEEE802.11n/ac standard. BER performance is
evaluated in AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise)
channel to demonstrate its robustness to DC offset error.
B.
PAPR
Fig. 2 (a) shows CCDF (Complementary Cumulative
Distribution Function) of PAPR of the proposed NDCS-
DFTs-OFDM and compares it with those of the conventional
OFDM and DFTs-OFDM in the case of QPSK. As DFTs-
OFDM is essentially the same as single carrier modulation
signals filtered by the ideal filter, its PAPR is the least
among three schemes, and is 2dB lower than that of OFDM
at CCDF=1%. PAPR of the proposed NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
is slightly higher than that of DFTs-OFDM, however it is
1.7dB lower than that of OFDM. Fig. 2 (b) compares CCDF
of PAPR of the proposed NDCS-DFTs-OFDM with DFTs-
OFDM and OFDM in the case of 16QAM. PAPR of NDCS-
DFTs-OFDM is slightly higher that that of DFTs-OFDM,
however it is 1.2dB lower that that of OFDM. These results
confirm that the proposed NDCS-DFTs-OFDM scheme
achieves as low PAPR as DFTs-OFDM.
C.
Power spectrum
Fig. 3 shows power spectrum of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM in
the case of QPSK and compares it with DFTs-OFDM and
OFDM in the case of linear amplifier and non-linear
amplifier with OBO=3dB. Rapp model is used for the
simulation of non-linear amplifier. As seen in Fig. 3 (a),
there is no difference among three schemes in a linear
channel. Note that DFTs-OFDM has slightly narrower
spectrum as DC sub-carrier is used. In the case of non-linear
amplifier with OBO=3dB as shown in Fig. 3 (b), the side-
lobe level of DFTs-OFDM signals is the least among three
schemes. The side-lobe level of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM is
almost the same as that of DFTs-OFDM and a few dB lower
than that of OFDM. This means the proposed scheme has
lower adjacent channel power leakage than OFDM when
OBO is 3dB and can use smaller OBO than OFDM.

OFDM in the case of linear amplifier and non-linear
amplifier with OBO=3dB. Rapp model is used for the
simulation of non-linear amplifier [8]. As seen in Fig. 3 (a),
there is no difference among three schemes in a linear
channel. Note that DFTs-OFDM has slightly narrower
spectrum as DC sub-carrier is used. In the case of non-linear
amplifier with OBO=3dB as shown in Fig. 3 (b), the side-
lobe level of DFTs-OFDM signals is the least among three

BER performance and EVM
Fig. 4 compares BER performance of NDCS-DFTs-
OFDM and DFTs-OFDM using QPSK with/without R=3/4
FEC, when DC offset error is 5%. DC offset error is defined
by A/A at the D/A converter of the transmitter and the A/D
converter of the receiver where A is DC offset error and A
is the eye aperture at I/Q channels. When DC offset error
exists, NDCS-DFTs-OFDM shows no Eb/No degradation and
less Eb/No degradation at BER=10-4 in comparison with
DFTs-OFDM.

OFDM. Though Eb/No degradation at BER=10-4 is as large as
3dB for 16QAM without FEC and 1dB for 16QAM with
FEC in DFTs-OFDM, NDCS-DFTs-OFDM shows no Eb/No
degradation due to DC offset error.
Another measure to evaluate the robustness against DC
offset error is EVM. Fig. 6 compares EVM of QPSK,

16QAM and 64QAM as a function of DC offset error for
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM and DFTs-OFDM. As shown there,
EVM increases in proportion to DC offset error in DFTs-
OFDM. EVM of 16QAM and 64QAM is slightly worse than
that of QPSK. On the other hand, no EVM increase is shown
according to DC offset error in NDCS-DFTs-OFDM,
Therefore, BER performance of NDCS-DFTs-OFDM is not
degraded due to DC offset error as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper described an application of DFT spreading to
OFDM based WLAN to improve energy efficiency. In order
to maintain the robustness to DC offset error, this paper
proposed a new type of DFTs-OFDM, NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
by splitting the spectrum after DFT spreading into two parts
and
making
DC
sub-carrier
null.
Though
the
signal
processing complexity is 3.5 times larger than OFDM under
the condition that the basic parameters of OFDM are
maintained, the simulation results confirmed the proposed
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM achieves both advantages of low PAPR
and robustness to DC offset error. Future work includes BER
performance
evaluation
of
NDCS-DFTs-OFDM
in
frequency selective fading as well as under the non-linear
amplifier operation. In addition, the power consumption
trade-off between NDCS-DFTs-OFDM and larger OBO of
HPA must be conducted.
