Abstract—The development of internet of things devices, smart 
sensor systems or wearables necessitates new fabrication 
technologies. The challenge is to fulfil requirements such as 
flexibility, low-weight and low-cost. Inkjet printing of 
conductive microstructures on polymer films has become 
increasingly important for these applications in the last decade. 
This additive fabrication approach is potentially more 
ecofriendly than conventional processes but has still not reached 
wider implementation in industry. One of the potential reasons 
is the still insufficient reliability of printed components that 
must sustain electrical, thermal, mechanical and chemical 
stress. In order to optimize the fabrication process with regard 
to these requirements, the nano- and microstructure of printed 
patterns needs to be analyzed. In the present work, a method is 
outlined for the nano- and microstructure analysis of inkjet-
printed conductive tracks on polymer substrates by means of 
scanning electron microscopy of cross sections prepared by 
ultramicrotomy.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the last decade, printing technologies have become 
more and more important in research and development for 
flexible electronics [1]. The objective is to replace 
conventional subtractive fabrication processes of printed 
circuit board (PCB) manufacturing by additive processes. 
Printing processes can be used to fabricate conductive 
structures, as well as more complex electronic components on 
flexible polymer films.  
A. Advantages of printing technologies 
Various printing technologies were transferred from the 
realm of graphic printing to electronics manufacturing in the 
last decade. As manufacturing processes can be divided into 
those, which are well suited for mass production and those that 
are more suited for single part or small series production, 
printing processes may be also classified with regard to 
process productivity. Conventional printing processes based 
on printing forms are well suited for large-scale production 
whereas non-impact principles are more suited to individual 
part up to small series manufacturing and research 
applications [2] [3].  
Unlike the conventional fabrication of PCB’s that needs 
some complex electroplating, lithography and etching steps, 
printing processes usually need one single additive fabrication 
step followed by an additional curing process in order to create 
conductive tracks on a substrate [4] [5]. Thus material usage 
is optimized and the toxic waste accumulated in subtractive 
processing is eliminated [6]. Printing allows faster, cleaner, 
cheaper and more environmentally friendly fabrication of 
PCB’s than conventional processes [5]. Additionally, printing 
enables large area processing of flexible polymer substrates at 
low temperatures and ambient conditions [7]. 
The implementation of printing processes for a desired 
electronic function in microstructure resolution demands 
prudent selection of the three main process components - ink, 
substrate and printing system. These components have to be 
precisely tuned to get optimum conditions for realizing 
features with high reproducibility [2].  
B. Conductive ink 
A fundamental element in printed electronics are 
conductive tracks [4]. They have to provide high 
conductivities in order to minimize the power loss. Regarding 
this requirement, currently two main ink types are available. 
One type are metal organic decomposition (MOD) inks, with 
oxidized metal ions as main component [8]. The most 
prevalent type are nanoparticle inks, where the particles are 
dispersed in solvents and stabilized by an organic capping 
agent against agglomeration [9]. 
Due to their high conductivity, silver-based inks are most 
widely used in this context [6]. For printed silver nanoparticle 
tracks a conductivity of about 10 % of bulk silver is acceptable 
for many applications [10]. 
The nanoparticle size severely influences the curing 
process. The smaller the particles, the lower the melting point 
compared to the bulk material [11] [12].

C. Substrate 
For printed flexible electronic applications with optical 
functions, often low cost polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
substrates are used which have a glass-transition temperature 
(Tg) of 78 °C and a melting point of 255 °C [13] [14]. 
Commercially available PET films, e.g., Melinex® ST from 
DuPont Teijin Films are often used in printed electronic 
applications. Such PET substrates are thermoplastic semi-
crystalline polymer films whose maximum working 
temperature for printing and sintering processes (Tmax) from 
about 150 °C is largely independent of their Tg due to a heat-
stabilization [13] [14] [15]. Semi-crystalline polymer films 
have better resistances against solvents than amorphous 
polymers [15]. 
D. Inkjet-printing 
Drop-on-demand (DoD) piezo inkjet printing is the most 
common non-impact printing principle in the field of printed 
electronics [7]. It allows direct, mask-less and vectorial 
printing of layouts on flexible polymer films [2]. The layouts 
are created by computer-aided design (CAD). With regard to 
printability, ink property parameters such as viscosity, surface 
energy, density, particle size and particle stability are of 
crucial importance [4] [5]. For example, a particle size of less 
than 100 nm is recommended in order to prevent print head 
nozzle clogging [16].  
Compared 
to 
conventional 
electronics 
fabrication 
processes, inkjet-printed structures often suffer from non-
uniformity, low line edge quality and non-reproducible 
morphology [17] [18]. In order to obtain an optimum line 
quality, the important parameters that need to be controlled 
are the distance between two adjacent droplets (dd), the 
frequency of droplet generation (fd), the droplet velocity (vd), 
the substrate temperature (Ts) and substrate surface properties 
[19] [20]. 
E. Curing 
After the printing process, the resulting structures must be 
cured in order to get the desired electrical conductivity [10]. 
First, the ink solvent has to be evaporated; then, the organic 
stabilizing shell has to be removed. During the sintering, a 
percolation-based network of conductive paths is established 
due to sporadic agglomeration of particles [10]. At higher 
temperatures, sintering necks improve the conductivity, the 
coalescence of the particles leads to a higher metal density of 
the printed feature [21]. High conductivities have been 
achieved by means of an oven sintering regime with 
30 minutes or more at temperatures above 250 °C [1]. 
Despite the lower melting point of nanoparticles compared 
to the bulk material, a sintering regime required for such an 
enhanced conductivity is not compatible with many of the 
preferably used low-cost polymer substrates, e.g., PET [22]. 
Therefore, low temperature sintering methods are taken 
into consideration that allow either sintering at room 
temperature (commonly known as chemical sintering) or 
selective sintering where only the printed structure that needs 
to be cured is heated while the substrate stays at moderate 
temperatures [1].  
Chemical sintering comprises, among other methods, 
sintering triggered by additives in the ink or in the substrate 
[23]. 
Selective sintering methods are photonic flash sintering, 
laser sintering, plasma sintering, microwave sintering and 
electrical current sintering [1] [10]. 
F. Properties of printed structures 
In view of the manifold applications of printed structures, 
such as conductors, passive components, etc., not only their 
electrical characteristics must be considered, but also their 
mechanical and chemical properties. Printed conductive 
tracks have to withstand mechanical, chemical und thermal 
stresses that can influence their inherent porous nanostructure 
and thereby impair the reliability. Particularly, adhesion 
strength to the substrate, bendability and fatigue resistance are 
important properties of printed structures for applications on 
flexible polymer substrates. Sintering conditions substantially 
influence mechanical properties, such as fatigue resistance 
[24]. 
G. Hybrid electronics 
To date, many electronic functional elements besides 
conductive tracks such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, 
organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic photovoltaics 
(OPV) and sensors have been realized by printing 
technologies. However, it is currently not possible to achieve 
the performance of conventionally fabricated devices. 
Moreover, highly integrated circuits such as microcontrollers 
cannot yet be realized by printing. Therefore, a hybrid 
approach for the fabrication of more complex electronic 
systems on flexible polymer substrates seems to be an 
interesting solution in the medium term to overcome the still 
low performance of printed complex elements [25] [26]. 
Marjanović et al. define hybrid electronic integration as the 
combination of printed components and surface-mount 
technology (SMT) devices on foils [25].  
For demonstration of a hybrid intralayer-integration 
approach, the conductive track structure of a flip-flop circuit 
shown in [26] was first printed via silver nanoparticle ink on 
a PET film. Then SMT components were mounted with 
conductive adhesive. Figure 1 shows the realized flip-flop

circuit. Tests with such circuits indicated that the system is 
sensitive to mechanical stress such as bending. Either the 
conductive adhesive that connects the SMT components fails 
or the conductive tracks crack or delaminate from the 
substrate. In order to improve the structure’s resistance to 
mechanical stress, the microstructure of the printed tracks has 
to be investigated, as it directly affects the mechanical 
properties of the printed feature and is of high importance for 
reliable circuits [27].  
After this introduction to hybrid electronics using additive 
manufacturing processes, in section II the materials and 
methods are described that were used for realizing test 
structures. In section II A., the test structure is described, in II 
B., the applied inkjet printer, the silver ink and the PET 
substrate are presented. The Section II C. illustrates the 
printing process and II D. the sample preparation that is 
needed for the analysis of the cross sections. In section III, the 
results of the printing process (III A.), the sample preparation 
(III B.) and the SEM analysis of the fabricated cross sections 
(III C.) are outlined. Finally, section IV gives a conclusion and 
an outlook.   
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Test structure 
A test structure was defined for the electrical and 
mechanical evaluation of the properties of different ink-
substrate-printer-combinations and different processing 
parameters. The test structure conceived for electrical and 
mechanical characterization consists of a 45 mm long 
conductive track (L) that connects two contact pads each 
having a length (B) of 7 mm and a width (T) of 2 mm. Figure 2 
shows the geometry of the test structure (top) and some inkjet-
printed samples (bottom). 
B. Material (printer, ink and substrate) 
The printer used for printing the test structures is based on 
our custom-built piezo-driven four-axis positioning system 
NAMOSE. 
It 
has 
a 
working 
space 
of 
400 mm x 150 mm x 40 mm, a repeatability of less than 1 µm 
and a maximum speed of 200 mm/s [2]. NAMOSE is 
controlled 
by 
a 
Beckhoff-CX2040 
with 
TwinCAT, 
programmable logic controller (PLC) and numerical control 
(NC) axis controlling. For inkjet-printing, the positioning 
system is equipped with a piezo-electrically driven single 
nozzle Microfab print head (MJ-AL-01-50-8MX) with an 
orifice diameter of 50 µm [2]. A NC-task synchronizes the 
droplet frequency (fd) with the axis velocity (v), while the 
droplet distance (dd) is maintained at its set point. 
Furthermore, the NAMOSE is equipped with a heated vacuum 
chuck and an optical observation system for controlling and 
adjusting droplet formation. 
The silver-nanoparticle ink DGP 40LT-15C (Advanced 
Nano Products (ANP)) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich 
(736465 ALDRICH). The ink has a solid content of 
30 - 35 wt %, a surface tension of 35 - 38 mN/m, a viscosity 
of about 10 - 17 mPa·s and is designed for application on 
polymer films. The manufacturer recommends a curing 
regime with 30 - 60 minutes at 120 - 150 °C. The main solvent 
of the ink is triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (TGME) [28]. 
The ink contains polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as capping 
agent that leads to an electrostatic stabilization of the 
nanoparticles [9]. 
In the present work, two different PET-films were used as 
substrates. The 125 µm thick Melinex® ST506™ from 
DuPont Teijin Films is optimized for printed electronics. Both 
sides of this film are pre-treated for improved adhesion of inks 
[14]. The NB-TP-3GU100 from Mitsubishi Paper Mills is a 
135 µm thick PET-film that is optimized for inkjet-printing of 
conductive structures based on silver nanoparticle dispersions. 
Due to its optimized nanoporous single side coating, it 
provides fast drying of water-based inks [29]. The thickness, 
morphology and the surface chemistry of this coating are not 
further specified by the supplier. 
C. Printing samples 
Test structures were printed on both substrates using the 
ink DGP 40LT-15C. Table I shows the printing parameters for 
four different samples. After printing, the samples were cured 
in a convection oven (Memmert UP 500) for about 60 min. at 
120 °C. 
After curing, the width of the central part of the test 
structure (see the red box in Figure 2) was measured by optical 
microscopy and image processing with the DIPLOM software 
that was developed at the KIT Institute for Applied Computer 
Science (IAI). The image processing yields the standard 
deviation of the line widths, which can be used as indicator of 
the line edge quality. 
D.  Sample preparation for SEM-analysis 
For analyzing the cross section of central printed tracks, 
about 10 mm long and 1.5 mm wide rectangular specimen 
were cut from the printed test structures (see the red box in 
Figure 2). 
As it is not possible at ambient conditions, to directly cut 
the flexible polymer with an ultramicrotome without

delamination of the ink, the printed samples need to be 
embedded into polymer blocks in order to get appropriate 
sections. Two different specimens were embedded parallel to 
each other into one embedding mould. 
As embedding resin, the Embed 812 Kit from Electron 
Microscopy Sciences was used. The filled embedding moulds 
were cured over night at 60 °C in a convection oven.  
After polymerization, the blocks with the embedded 
samples were removed from the moulds and then prepared for 
ultramicrotomy. For this purpose, the blocks were trimmed in 
a Leica Ultracut 7 ultramicrotome using a standard glass 
trimming knife. Then, sections of 100 nm and 200 nm 
thickness were cut with the same instrument but with a 
Diatome Ultra 35° knife at ambient conditions. The knife boat 
was filled with double-distilled water during the cutting 
process. To avoid electrostatic charging of the sample, a 
Diatome static line 2 ionizer was used. The cut sections are 
floating on the water surface of the knife boat, where they can 
be subsequently picked up and placed on a silicon wafer for 
imaging in the scanning electron microscope (SEM).  
For SEM imaging, an Ultra 55 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, 
Oberkochen, Germany) was used. 
Particle density in the SEM images of the cross sections 
was measured with the software package Fiji [30]. Figure 3 
illustrates the approach to determine the particle density by 
image segmentation. The threshold for the segmentation was 
manually selected for different details of a SEM-image of a 
cross section. The density of the particles in the sectional plane 
was calculated for each detail. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Printing 
In a preliminary test, it was found that the behavior of the 
ink after deposition at room temperature is completely 
different on the two different substrates. Although the initial 
wetting seems to be good, printing on the Melinex® ST506™ 
substrate is followed by a continuous parasitic spreading 
combined with a resulting shape similar to a coffee-ring 
effect. This results in very flat, broad and fringed tracks, with 
poor edge qualities. The nanoporous coating of the PET-film 
from Mitsubishi Paper Mills avoids this ink spreading over a 
broad range of droplet-distances dd. A considerable track 
height can be achieved, even for narrow tracks. Optimizing 
the droplet-distance (dd), it is even possible to print 
continuous tracks with a width of less than the diameter of a 
single droplet. Figure 4 shows microscope images of this 
preliminary test. The printing parameters were the same for 
both substrates: the jetting frequency (fd) was 2000 Hz, the 
axis speed (v) was 100 mm/s and the droplet-distance (dd) 
results in 50 µm. The silver track on Melinex® ST506™ (see 
Figure 4 left) shows a poor edge quality, a width of about 
1180 µm and a height in the range of about 100 nm, whereas 
the line printed on NB-TP-3GU100 (see Figure 4 right) has a 
good edge quality at a width of about 88 µm and a height of 
about 1140 nm.  
In further tests, it was found that printing on Melinex® 
ST506™, with 80 °C substrate temperature results in much 
better track quality. This parameter was maintained for all 
subsequent tests with this substrate.  
Concerning the sintering in a convection oven, an 
irreversible bulging of the NB-TP-3GU100 can be observed 
when heating above Tg of PET. A possible explanation for 
this effect could be different thermal expansion coefficients 
of the single-side nanoporous coating and the PET bulk 
material. The Melinex® ST506™ foil does not show such an 
effect. 
B. Sample preparation via ultramicrotomy

(left, a and b), the top of the block during trimming with the 
glass knife (center, c) and a section directly after cutting

200 nm sections can be cut reproducibly but with a 
significant wrinkling of the embedded specimens in the 
sections (see Figure 5 right, d and e). Lower section

thicknesses led to delamination between specimen and 
embedding resin. 
An initial observation of the cross sections concerned the 
nanoporous coating of the Mitsubishi substrate: We found a 
35 µm thick layer. The high thickness of this layer supports 
the hypothesis stated above that this might be the main reason 
for the warping of the substrate after thermal sintering.  
Different cutting directions were tested with respect to the 
sample orientation in the block: perpendicular, parallel and at 
an angle to the embedded substrate plane. Figure 6 shows 
typical results indicating the effect of the cutting direction 
(red arrows). 
When cutting is performed perpendicular to the substrate 
plane, the interface between the ink and the substrate is 
compressed and can therefore not be used for further 
investigation of the interface. Additionally, this section 
shows many wrinkles and dominant knife marks (see 
Figure 6 left). In contrast, sections obtained when cutting 
parallel to the substrate plane, show less wrinkles and knife 
marks (see Figure 6 center). It is assumed that this cutting 
direction introduces fewer mechanical stresses to the 
interface between ink and substrate. The sections obtained, 
when cutting at an angle of about 26° to the substrate plane, 
were also acceptable (see Figure 6 right). The embedded NB-
TP-3GU100 substrate (see Figure 6 a and c) produces much 
more wrinkles than the Melinex® ST506™ (see Figure 6 b 
and d). We suppose that Melinex® film is harder than the 
Mitsubishi film due to its heat and surface treatment. This can 
explain why the sections of NB-TP-3GU100 specimen show 
a stronger wrinkling than the Melinex® substrate. 
C. SEM analysis and image segmentation  
 Despite varying the cutting direction, a certain degree of 
section wrinkling was unavoidable. This led to a degradation 
of the sections in terms of cracks. Sometimes delamination 
occurred in the section while cutting. Figure 7 shows a 
section from a NB-TP-3GU100 substrate cut parallel to the 
substrate plane (a). It can be seen that the substrate was torn 
during the cutting process (see Figure 7 a) and the printed ink 
delaminates from the coated substrate at the locations of the 
wrinkles (b and c).  
Nevertheless, there are enough regions suitable for further 
analysis (compare Figure 7 b and c), since the cutting 
preserved the nanostructure of the cross section.  
Figure 8 shows the cross section of the samples B and D. 
The full low magnification cross section for each sample can 
be seen on the top, a detail image can be found on the bottom 
for each sample. Using such high magnification images from 
SEM we determined the particle density of each sample 
according to the procedure described above. The particle 
density of the conductive tracks calculated for all four samples 
was between 58 % and 65 %. 
Additionally, we found that the cross section of the tracks 
printed on Melinex® ST506™ levels off continuously in the 
direction of the edges (see the blue box in Figure 8 B). In 
contrast, the height of the silver track on NB-TP-3GU100 only 
decreases close to the edges (see the blue box in Figure 8 D). 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 
A method was outlined for analyzing the nano- and 
microstructure of inkjet printed conductive tracks on 
different polymer substrates using ultramicrotomy. The 
sections produced showed wrinkling along the substrate 
plane partially leading to delamination. This may result from 
stiffness differences between the substrate material and the

embedding resin, a parameter to be optimized in further 
investigations. Despite these delaminations, there were 
sufficient regions that could be used for investigation of the 
nanoparticle network of the printed conductive tracks. This 
indicates that with properly optimized embedding and cutting 
parameters, the described scheme is a promising method for 
analyzing thermal, mechanical and chemical influences on 
the nanostructure of printed metal nanoparticle inks and on 
the interface between substrate and ink.
