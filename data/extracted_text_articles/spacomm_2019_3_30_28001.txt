Abstract—High data rate communication links are difﬁcult to
perform with radio frequency technology under the strict Size,
Mass and Power (SMaP) constraints of small satellites. Trans-
mitting data using the optical spectrum can permit higher data
rates with more power efﬁcient systems. Single photon avalanche
diodes (SPADs) provide receivers with exceptional sensitivity
levels, while Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) bonded to electronic
driver chips provide digitally controllable optical transmitters
capable of high bandwidth spatial and temporal modulation. Data
rates of 100 Mb/s have been demonstrated at a sensitivity of -
55.2 dBm, and ray-tracing simulations indicate ranges in excess
of 1 km are feasible with simple optical systems. Additionally,
the divergent nature of LEDs can provide a level of spatial
coverage, relaxing pointing and alignment requirements. The
low electrical power requirements and compact, semiconductor
nature of these devices may therefore bring high data rate, high
sensitivity communications to small satellite platforms.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the development and deployment of small
satellites has increased rapidly, with the development of the
CubeSat standard greatly increasing academic and commercial
access to space [1]. The future deployment of constellations,
clusters or networks of small satellites necessitates high-speed
inter-satellite data connections operating under strict Size,
Mass and Power (SMaP) budgets. Communicating using the
optical spectrum is an attractive alternative to radio frequencies
due to the potential for high data rate systems with lower
SMaP requirements [2]. Optical Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs)
for large satellites achieve long ranges and Gb/s data rates
using phase coherent laser communication methods, but are
complex, costly and arguably too large and power hungry for
small satellites [3].
Research in optical communications for CubeSats has been
focussed on satellite to ground links using Laser Diodes
(LDs) and ﬁbre ampliﬁers as transmitters, however, similar
systems have been proposed for ISLs [4] and a low-earth
orbit (LEO) relay system [5]. The SMaP requirements for
these communication systems are well within the capability
of CubeSats, though they typically occupy at least a full 1U
module and require signiﬁcant battery power. Light-Emitting
Diodes (LEDs) are a potential alternative device suitable for
ISLs [6], bringing further advantages in SMaP constraints
over laser systems, along with reduced complexity, longer
lifetimes and lower cost. Gallium Nitride (GaN) micro-LEDs,
LEDs with dimensions below 100 µm, show high modulation
bandwidths and are an emerging technology for mass market
applications. Previous research, including from our own group,
suggests data rates comparable to the CubeSat LD systems
are achievable [7]. Additionally, the angular divergent nature
of LED emission may relax the tight pointing requirements
found in laser systems.
Here, we present an experimental demonstration of high
sensitivity, intensity modulated optical communications based
on LEDs and silicon Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)
arrays. The advantage of such a system is in its simplicity and
low SMaP requirements, while still achieving high sensitivities
and data rates. To justify that the ranges, data rates, and angular
tolerances are useful, ray-tracing simulations are presented.
In Section II, the experimental performance and SMaP
characteristics of the communication link are described, fol-
lowed by the ray-tracing results. Conclusions and further work
are presented in Section III.

MAIN RESULTS
The optical transmitter used in the experimental work
is a single 99 × 99 µm2 pixel, one of a 16 × 16 array
of GaN micro-LEDs bump bonded to complementary metal-
oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) control electronics. This device
provides a mm-scale chip containing optical emission elements
and driver electronics for independent control of every pixel.
Fabrication and characterisation details of similar devices are
reported in [8]. The emission wavelength is centred on 450 nm,
primarily due to device availability. We note that such devices
can be fabricated from the ultraviolet-C (UV-C) band to green
using nitride alloys with wavelengths spanning many of the
solar Fraunhofer lines, which may offer a low background
noise channel [6]. The receiver is a 64 × 64 array of SPADs,
arranged on a 21 µm pitch with a 43% ﬁll factor [9]. The digital
photon count signals from the pixels are combined through
XOR trees and ripple counters, causing the device to operate
as a digital silicon photomultiplier. An analytical discussion of
the performance of SPAD arrays for optical communications
can be found in Reference [10].
Details of the experimental arrangement and characterisa-
tion can be found in [11]. The resulting receiver sensitivity
results, -60.5 and -55.2 dBm for 50 and 100 Mb/s, respec-
tively, are shown in Figure 1 in red squares. Also shown are
sensitivities achieved by complementary work from [9], where
the same receiver was used for On-Off Keying (OOK) with a
LD transmitter. The experimental results remain approximately
a constant separation in dB from the standard quantum limit,
set by the Poissonian nature of photon detection. The linear

approximation shown in Figure 1 is used in the following
simulations to estimate data rates for calculated levels of
incident power.
Both the SPAD and LED chips are packaged and mounted
on evaluation printed circuit boards (PCBs) where they are
controlled and powered through ﬁeld-programmable gate ar-
rays (FPGAs) (Opal Kelly XEM3010/XEM6310). This results
in transmitter and receiver package sizes of 14 × 18.5 cm2
and 12.5 × 20.5 cm2 respectively. Large parts of these eval-
uation boards are unnecessary for ﬁnal applications, so a full
transceiver system could potentially be developed on the Cube-
Sat 10 × 10 cm2 standard. The electrical power consumption
of the full system under operation totals 5.48 W, with the
majority consumed by the FPGA control systems. The system
has not yet been optimised for power consumption, so this
value can be considered an upper limit. Many CubeSats already
employ FPGAs as part of their on-board systems, which could
be used to produce and process the digital signals required,
meaning only the micro-LED and SPAD arrays themselves
would consume additional power, estimated to total less than
1 W.
In order to determine a range and coverage performance en-
velope for the system, ray tracing simulations were performed
using Zemax OpticStudio R⃝. The transmitter was speciﬁed as
a 100 × 100 µm square, emitting 1 mW with a Lambertian
proﬁle typical of LEDs. A 10 cm diameter collection area was
assumed at the receiver, likely the largest on-board collection
area achievable with a CubeSat system. Three transmitter
optical systems were considered: (i) no lens, (ii) collimation
with the Thorlabs C240 lens used in the practical experiments,
and (iii) collimation with a Thorlabs ACL25416 lens. The
simulations were set up to determine intensity maps at varying
ranges up to 106 m. From the sensitivity approximation in
Figure 1(a), achievable data rates can then be determined. The
point-to-point results are shown in Figure 1(b). The intensity
falls off following the inverse quadratic trend expected for the
diverging beam, resulting in a reduction of achievable data
rate. Note that the data rate has been upper-end clipped at
100 Mb/s as this is the limit achievable with the micro-LED
transmitter operated in this manner. The results suggest the
communication link can provide useful data rates over ranges
up to 100’s of kilometres. Range and data rate requirements
will vary strongly with different satellite application scenarios,
however these results are in line with other targets in the
literature [4]–[6].
The collimation of light from the LED is still divergent,
causing losses and limiting range. Importantly, this divergent
light can be thought of as providing a level of coverage over
an angular region, reducing the pointing accuracy required of
the satellites. With the simulated intensity data, the achievable
range for a given data rate at an angle from the transmitter
can be determined. The results are shown in Figure 2 as
angular plots. Note that the radial axis is logarithmic, and
in the case of Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c), the angular axis
has been expanded in order to observe the proﬁles. With no
lens, the micro-LED provides a very wide degree of angular
coverage due to the Lambertian emission proﬁle. For example,
a 100 Mb/s link can be maintained at almost 60 degrees
over a 10 m range. At 10 kb/s, the same angular coverage
is maintained at approximately 1 km. The coverages provided
by the collimated beams in Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c) are
much lower, at roughly 1 and 0.4 degrees for the C240 and
ACL25416 respectively.
In a real deployment of this communication system on
a CubeSat platform, additional constraints and factors will
inﬂuence the performance of the ISL. Additional background
light incident on the SPAD receiver increases the signal power
required to maintain error free performance, so care would
have to be taken to avoid background light sources through
spectral and spatial ﬁltering. In extreme cases, such as under
direct solar irradiation, the receiver will likely saturate ren-
dering the communication link useless. Secondly, the receiver
optics have been simulated as a perfect collection area, a
practical system will have physical limitations on achieving
this, and some degree of loss will be inevitable. Finally, the
performance of these bespoke devices in orbit, with potential
for cosmic ray damage, is unknown. Silicon devices have a
long history in space applications, and the avalanche nature
of SPAD operation may help in protecting them from catas-
trophic breakdown. GaN devices are less mature for space
applications, though the fact that they function in spite of
high numbers of crystal dislocations suggests some degree of
resilience to defect-causing damage from charged particles.

CONCLUSION
In summary, a simple, low SMaP and high sensitivity com-
munication link based on micro-LEDs and SPADs provides an
attractive platform for CubeSat ISLs. The link distance and
coverage simulations shown here suggest ranges up to 100s of
kilometres are achievable with signiﬁcantly relaxed pointing
requirements compared to laser systems. Future experimental
work will initially focus on a practical demonstration of com-
munication at longer ranges (> 100 m) through air. Signiﬁcant
work will be required to build a system suitable for testing in
orbit on a CubeSat, primarily in developing an interface with
on-board computer systems and adjusting hardware to the cor-
rect form factor. Once a ﬁnal system has been developed, ray-
tracing simulations with accurate parameters, such as emitted
power, collection aperture and chosen optics, can be performed
