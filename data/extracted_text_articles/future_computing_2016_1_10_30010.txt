I. INTRODUCTION 
Due to the exponential increase of the electrical power 
demand and the average low generation efficiency in most of 
the developing countries, the issue of reducing the electrical 
power system loss while maintaining the system stability has 
received more attention. For example, in Saudi Arabia, the 
annual average peak electric demand increase is around 7.4% 
[1]. As of 2013, the distribution of plant capacity for 
electricity generation in Saudi Arabia, by technology is 
shown in Figure 1. The low efficient simple cycle steam 
turbine generation is making 32% of Saudi Arabia utility 
company generation fleet while the most efficient combined 
cycle is around 13.8% of the whole fleet [2]. These inspired 
most of the developing countries to unleash national 
initiatives to optimize electrical usage and reduce system 
loss. The subject issue can be addressed by adjusting 
transformer taps and generators and synchronous motors 
buses voltages.  
Heuristic methods are very powerful in addressing the 
electricals system loss optimization by searching the solution 
space for the optimal solutions. Many intelligent algorithms 
were implemented to identify the pareto-optimal solution set 
for the subject. The DEA in most cases demonstrates superior

over other algorithms such as the genetic algorithm [3]-[6].   
Most of the previous studies in the literature used virtual 
IEEE system models to address the power loss and system 
stability multiobjective optimization problem or other 
problems [7]-[9]. A truncation technique is implemented with 
the DEA to manage the size of the Pareto-optimal set solution 
[9]. The fuzzy logic is the most common technique in 
extracting the best compromise solution out of the pareto-
optimal solution set [7][9].  
This paper considers an existing real life hydrocarbon 
central processing facility electrical power system model for 
assessing the potential of DEA in optimizing two competing 
objectives simultaneously: power system loss and system 
stability index improvement. In Section 2 of the paper, the 
problem will be formulated as a multiobjective optimization 
problem with equality and inequality constraints. In Section 
3, the multiobjective optimization process will be illustrated. 
In Section 4, the DEA approach will be addressed. In Section 
5, the paper study cases will be developed. Finally, in Section 
6 the technical and economic analysis of the studied cases 
results will be presented. 
 
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
 
The problem formulation consists of five parts: the 
development of the objective functions, the calculation of all 
load buses stability index (L-Index), the identification of the 
system electrical constraints to be met - equality and 
inequality constraints - and the illustration of the fuzzy logic 
and the truncation technique.

A. Problem Objective Functions 
 
In this paper, two competing objective functions will be addressed 
as follows:  
 
A.1 System Loss Objective Function  
 
This objective function is to minimize the real power loss 
J1 (PLoss) in the transmission and distribution lines. This 
objective function can be expressed in term of the power 
follow loss between two buses i and j as follows: 
 
         J1 = PLoss = ∑
 𝒈𝒌 [ 𝑽𝒊
𝟐 + 𝑽𝒋
𝟐 − 𝟐  𝑽𝒊𝑽𝒋 𝐜𝐨𝐬(𝜹𝒊 − 𝜹𝒊)] 
𝒏𝒍
𝒌=𝟏
            (1) 
 
where nl is the number of transmission and distribution 
lines; gk is the conductance of the kth line, Vi i  and Vj j   
are the voltage at end buses i and j of the kth line, respectively  
[7] [9]. 
 
The objective is to minimize Ploss, that is,  
J1= Minimize (Ploss)                                                                 (2) 
A.2 Voltage Stability Index (Lmax)  
 
 The L indicator varies in the range between 0 (the no load 
case) and 1, which corresponds to voltage collapse. This 
indicator uses the bus voltage and network information 
provided by the power flow program to measure the stability 
of the system. The L indicator can be calculated as given in 
[10]. For a multi-node system

By segregating the load buses (PQ) from generator buses 
(PV), (3) can be written as: 
 
      [𝑰𝑳
𝑰𝑮] = [𝒀𝟏

where  
VL , IL are load buses voltages and currents 
VG , IG are Generator buses voltages and currents 
H1 ,H2 ,H3 ,H4 are submatrices generated from Ybus Partial 
Inversion 
ZLL ,FLG , KGL ,YGG  are submatrices of H-matrix 
 
Therefore, a local indicator Lj can be worked out for each 
node j similar to the line model 
                                  Lj = |𝟏 −
∑
𝒊  𝑮  𝑭𝒋𝒊
 𝑽𝒊
𝑽𝒋
|              (6) 
 
For a stable situation, the condition Lj ≤ 1 must not be violated 
for any of the nodes j. Therefore, a global indicator L 
describing the stability of the whole system is given by: 
 
                     Lmax= MAXjL |𝟏 −
∑
𝒊  𝑮  𝑭𝒋𝒊
 𝑽𝒊
𝑽𝒋
|           (7) 
 
where L is the set of load buses and G is the set of generator 
buses.  
 
The objective is to minimize Lmax, that is,  
J2= Minimize (Lmax)                                                                 (8) 
 
Combining the objectives functions and these constraints, the 
problem can be mathematically formulated as a nonlinear 
constrained single objective optimization problem as follows: 
 
Minimize J1 and J2   
Subject to: 
                                      g(x,u) = 0                                      (9) 
                                      |h(x,u)| ≤ 0                                   (10) 
where: 
x:   is the vector of dependent variables consisting of load  bus 
voltage VL, generator reactive power outputs QG and the 
Synchronous motors reactive Power QSynch. As a result, x 
can be expressed as 
     xT= [VL1..VLNL, QGi…QGNG, QSynchi…QSynchNSynch]       (11) 
 
u:  is the vector of control variables consisting of generator 
voltages VG, transformer tap settings T, and synchronous 
motors voltage VSynch. As a result, u can be expressed as 
            uT = [VG1..VGNL, T1…TNT, VSynch1..VSynchNL]             (12) 
 
g: are the equality constraints. 
h: are the inequality constraints. 
B. Problem Equality and Inequality Constraints  
 
The system constraints are divided into two categories: 
equality constraints and inequality constraints [6][7]. Details 
are as follows: 
 
B.1 Equality Constraints 
 
These constraints represent the power load flow 
equations. The balance between the active power injected PGi, 
the active power demand PDi and the active power loss Pli at 
any bus i is equal to zero. The same balance apply for the 
reactive power QGi, QDi , and  Qli. These balances are 
presented as follows: 
 
                             PGi− PDi −  Pli = 0                            (13) 
 
                             QGi− QDi −  Qli = 0                        (14) 
The above equations cane be detailed as follows:

and bus j, respectively.

These constraints represent the system operating 
constraints posted in Table IV. 
C.  Fuzzy Logic for Selecting the Best Compromise Solution 
 
Upon having the Pareto-optimal set of nondominated 
solution, the proposed approach presents one solution to the 
decision maker as the best compromise solution. Due to 
imprecise nature of the decision maker’s judgment, the i-th 
objective function Fi is represented by a membership function 
i defined as [7] [9].

where

solutions, respectively.

where M is the number of nondominated solutions. The best 
compromise solution is that having the maximum value of k. 
 
D. Pareto Set Reduction by Truncation  
 
A minimum distance based algorithm [9] is employed to 
reduce the Pareto set to manageable size. At each iteration, 
an individual i is chosen for removal from the external pareto 
set 𝑃𝑡+1. The algorithm is illustrated in the following steps: 
Step 1: find the nearest individuals A and B in the objective 
functions space. 
Step 2: calculate the distance dA and dB of the next nearest 
individual from A and B in the objective function space 
respectively. 
Step 3: Delete the individual with the smaller one between dA 
and dB. 
 
III. 
MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION 
 
In real life, there are problems that involve simultaneous 
optimization with no common thing in-between.  Usually, 
these problems are competing multiobjective optimization 
which mandates developing a set of optimal solutions, 
instead of one optimal solution. The reason for the optimality 
of many solutions is that no one can be considered to be better 
than any other with respect to all objective functions. These 
optimal solutions are known as Pareto- optimal solutions set. 
A universal multiobjective optimization problem consists 
of a number of objectives to be optimized simultaneously in 
association with a number of equality and inequality 
constraints. It can be formulated as follows:

where fi is the ith objective functions, x is a decision vector 
that represents a solution, and Nobj is the number of 
objectives. 
For a multiobjective optimization problem, any two 
solutions x1 and x2 can have one of two possibilities: one 
covers or dominates the other or none dominates the other. In 
a minimization problem, without loss of generality, a solution 
x1 dominates x2 if the following two conditions are satisfied:

If any of the above conditions is violated, solution x1 does 
not dominate the solution x2. If x1 dominates solution x2, x1 is 
called the nondominated solution. The solutions that are 
nondominated within the entire search space are denoted as 
Pareto-optimal and constitute the Pareto-optimal set. 
 
IV. 
THE DEA APPROACH 
 
The DEA evolution process are summarized in the 
following steps [11] [12]: 
Step 1: Initialization 
            The population P0  is generated with K size and an vacant 
annals (external) Pareto-optimal set  P0̅  with 𝐾̅ size. 
     Step 2: Updating of external pareto set 
           To bring the external pareto-optimal set up to date, the 
following steps are to be shadowed,

(a) Population non-dominated individuals are highlighted 
and reproduce to the external Pareto set.  
(b) Look for set of external Pareto, designed for the non-
dominated individuals. 
(c) If condition ( 𝑃𝑡+1
̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) <𝐾̅ is satisfied, keep the individuals 
with higher fitness values untial | 𝑃𝑡+1
̅̅̅̅̅̅| =   𝐾̅ is satisfied. 
(d) If ( 𝑃𝑡+1
̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) >𝐾̅, truncation procedure is called which 
removes individuals from ( 𝑃𝑡+1
̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) in anticipation of | 
𝑃𝑡+1
̅̅̅̅̅̅| =   𝐾̅. 
 Step 3: Assignment of fitness values 
The fitness values of the individuals are calculated in the 
external Pareto set Pt̅ and the population 𝑃𝑡 𝑎s follows: 
(a) St(i); strength value;  is assigned to all individuals i 
inside the external pareto set 𝑃𝑡̅ and the population Pt. 
St(i) signifies the unit, which i dominates and it is 
expressed as follow:  
 
       St(i) = | { j, j ϵ 𝑃𝑡  + 𝑃𝑡̅ , ^ i ≻ j } |                           (23) 
       
    Then, the raw fitness Rw(i) with respect to an individual   
can be measured  as follows: 
        
        Rw (i)=∑
𝑗𝜖𝑃𝑡+𝑃̅𝑡 ,𝑗≻𝑖 𝑆𝑡(𝑗)
                                           (24) 
        
       The raw fitness of an individual is obtained with respect 
to the strength of its dominators in the archive and 
population.  
(b) The distances between an individual i and the entire j 
individuals, in the course of external and   population sets 
and are enlisted. Then, the list is sorted in a cumulative 
manner, the distance to the mth individual, consequently 
m = √𝐾̅ + 𝐾 is represented as 𝜎𝑖
𝑚. Then, the density D(i) 
is calculated for each  i 
 
      D (i) = 
1
𝜎𝑖
𝑚+2        
                         (25) 
 
The addition of integer 2 is made in the denominator to 
certify that the value of D (i) is larger than zero and is < 
1. The fitness value i of an individual is expressed as 
follows: 
        F (i) = Rw (i) + D(i)                                                           (26) 
 
Step 4: Mutation 
Different from the SPEA2 in which the individuals to be 
subjected to crossover and mutation are selected from the 
front pareto optimal set, in DEA the individuals are selected 
from the population. In the DEA, mutation is performed using 
the DE/rand/1 mutation technique. Vi (t), the mutated vector, 
is created for each population member Xi (t) set by randomly 
selecting three individuals’ xr1, xr2 and xr3 and not 
corresponding to the current individual xi . Then, a scalar 
number F is used to scale the different between any two of 
the selected individuals. The resultant difference is added to 
the third selected individual. The mutation process can be 
written as: 
Vi,j(t) = xr1,j (t) + F . [ xr2,j(t) - xr3,j (t) ]                             (27) 
 
The value of F is usually selected between 0.4 and 1.0; in this 
study F was set to be 0.5 (50%). 
Step 5: Crossover 
Perform the binomial crossover, which can be expressed as 
follow: 
 
𝑢𝑖,𝑗(𝑡) = {𝑣𝑖,𝑗(𝑡) 𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 (0,1) < 𝐶𝑅
𝑥𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡)                             𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒                   (28) 
 
CR is the crossover control parameter and it usually set 
within the range [0, 1]. The child ui,j(t) will contend with its 
parent xi,j(t). CR is set equal to 0.9 (90%) in ths study  
Step 6: Selection 
The procedure for the selection is as follows: 
 
xi(t+1) = ui(t)      condition    f(ui(t)) ≤   f(xi(t))               (29) 
 
xi(t+1) = xi(t)      condition    f(xi(t)) ≤   f(ui(t))                (30) 
 
where f( ) is the objective function to be minimized.     
Step 7:  Looping back/Termination  
Look for the terminating criteria. If the criteria are not 
fulfilled, then generate new offspring population to previous 
one. If satisfied, apply the fuzzy set theory for the 
identification of the best compromise pareto set. Figure 2. 
demonstrates DEA evolutionary steps.

In this paper, three cases were studied. First, is the base 
case - business as usual (BAU). Second, the different number 
of generation with fix population size optimization case.

Third, the different population size with fix number of 
generation optimization case. In the two optimization cases, 
the best compromised values of the objective functions (J1 
and J2) are obtained. 
 
A.  Base Case Scenario (Business as Usual) 
 
The base case scenario (BAU) which is also called normal 
system operation mode was simulated to be benchmarked 
with the two optimal cases. Following are some of the normal 
system operation mode parameters: 
1) The utility bus and generators terminal buses were set at 
unity p.u. voltage. 
2) All the synchronous motors were set to operate very close 
to the unity power factor.   
3) All downstream distribution transformers’ and the captive 
synchronous motors transformers’ off-load tap changers 
were put on the neutral tap. 
4) The causeway substations main transformers’ taps were 
raised to meet the very conservative buses voltage 
constraints (≥ 0.95p.u.) at these substations downstream 
buses 
as 
posted 
in 
Table 
IV. 
 
These 
main 
transformers’selected taps values are as per Table I below.

B. Different Generation Number with Fix Population Size Case 
 
In this case, the crossover rate is fixed at 90%, the 
mutation rate is fixed at 50%, the population size was fixed 
at 100 individuals and the front pareto set population is fixed 
to be 50 individuals. Yet, the number of generations was 
varied to be 50, 100 and 150 respectively. The effect of 
different number of generations on the DEA performance 
compared to the BAU case is posted in Table II.

C. Different Population Size with Fix Generation Number Case  
 
In this case, the number of generations is fixed at 50, the 
crossover rate is fixed at 90%, the mutation rate is fixed at 
50% and the front pareto set population is fixed to be 50 
individuals. Yet, the population size was varied to be 100, 
200 and 300 correspondingly. Table III shows the effect of 
population size on the DEA performance compared to the 
BAU case. Population size of 200 produces better optimized 
value of J1 while population size of 300 produces better 
optimized value of J2.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
The results from the three studied cases will be analyzed 
in two categories: the system parameters analysis and the 
economic analysis.  
 
A. System Parameters Analysis  
 
The hydrocarbon facility simplified electrical system 
model, which is studied in this paper, is shown in Figure 3.

The front pareto-optimal solution set for the first optimal 
studied case - different number of generation with fixed 
number of generation - is captured in Figure 4.

The second optimal case - different population size - front 
pareto-optimal solution sets are shown in Figure 5. As shown 
in both figures none of the different population sizes or 
generation number produces very well distributed front 
pareto optimal set. A better distributed front pareto optimal 
set may be produced by trying higher population size or 
generation number. Yet, this will increase the evolution 
process. Massaging the crossover and mutation rate may also 
results in well distributed front pareto optimal set.

B. Economic Analysis  
The avoided annual cost due to the optimization of the 
system power loss is demonstrated in Figure 6 for the BAU 
and the two optimal cases. The annual cost avoidance based 
on natural gas cost of $3.5 per MMscf is around $69,507/year 
for the 150 generations with 100 population size scenario part 
of the first optimal case. It is $71,218/year for 200 population 
size with 50 generations scenario part of the second optimal 
case.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
This paper presented the potential of DEA in addressing 
the 
studied 
multiobjective 
problem 
for 
a 
real-life 
hydrocarbon facility. It was clearly demonstrated that 
increasing of generations number have better impact in 
producing better pareto-optimal set solution. Yet, many of the 
pareto-optimal solution set converged to the same J1 and J2 
values.  The annual avoided cost due to the power loss 
reduction was captured. Future study may need to address the

effectiveness of different crossover and mutation rate 
percentage in the pareto-optimal solution set values and 
distribution. The use of different fix or dynamic mutation and 
crossover rate is a subject of future study considering the 
problem in hand.
