Abstract—The purpose of this study is to identify optimal 
algorithm for emotion classification which classify seven 
different emotional states (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, 
disgust, surprise, and stress) using physiological features. Skin 
temperature, photoplethysmography, electrodermal activity 
and electrocardiogram are recorded and analyzed as 
physiological signals. For classification problems of the seven 
emotions, the design involves two main phases. At the first 
phase, Particle Swarm Optimization selects P % of patterns to 
be treated as prototypes of seven emotional categories. At the 
second phase, the PSO is instrumental in the formation of a 
core set of features that constitute a collection of the most 
meaningful and highly discriminative elements of the original 
feature space. The study offers a complete algorithmic 
framework and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach 
for a collection of selected data sets.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the most popular research in the field of 
emotion recognitions is to recognize human’s feeling using 
various physiological signals.  In the physio-psychological 
research, it is known that there is strong correlation between 
human 
emotion 
state 
and 
physiological 
reaction. 
Psychologists and engineers have tried to analyze facial 
expressions, vocal emotions, gestures, and physiological 
signals in an attempt to understand and categorize emotions 
[1][2]. Most of all, physiological signals have been used to 
recognize human's emotions and feelings because the signals 
acquisition by non-invasive sensors is relatively simple, 
physiological responses induced by emotion are less 
sensitive in social and cultural difference, and there is a 
strong relationship between  physiological reactions and 
emotional and affective states of humans [3]. 
Many previous studies on emotion have reported that 
there is correlation between basic emotions such as 
happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc. and physiological 
responses [3][4]. Recently, emotion recognition using 
physiological signals has been performed by various 
machine learning algorithms, that is, Fisher’s Linear 
Discriminant (FLD), k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (kNN), 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and so on [5-8]. One of 
most widely applied machine learning method is instance-
based learning (IBL [9]) which was shown to perform well 
in a number of challenging learning tasks.  
In this paper, we introduce identification of optimal 
emotion classifier with feature selections using physiology 
signals induced by emotional stimuli for seven emotion 
classifications (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, 
surprise, and stress).  To induce each emotion, ten emotional 
stimuli sets which have been tested for their suitability and 
effectiveness, are used in experiment. Physiological signals, 
namely, Skin temperature (SKT), photoplethysmography 
(PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA) and electrocardiogram 
(ECG) are acquired by MP100 Biopac system Inc. (USA) 
and analyzed to extract features for emotional pattern dataset. 
To complete their efficient development of a classifier for 
the seven emotions, we use one of the techniques of 
evolutionary 
optimization, 
namely, 
particle 
swarm 
optimization (PSO). In order to improve classification speed 
and classifier accuracy for the seven emotions, suitable 
formations of a set of prototypes and a core set of features 
are required. PSO embraces two level optimization processes. 
In the first level, PSO choose P % of patterns as a set of 
prototypes comes from patterns with seven emotional 
categories. In the second level of the optimization process, 
PSO is instrumental in the formation of a core set of features 
that is a collection of the most meaningful and discriminative 
components of the original feature space. Numerical 
experiments were carried out and it is shown that a suitable 
selection of prototypes and a substantial reduction of the 
feature space could be accomplished that is also 
accompanied with a higher classification accuracy using 
physiological signals for the seven emotions.

MEASUREMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS AND 
EMOTIONAL STIMULI 
In this section, we will deal with experiments for the 
induction of the seven emotions and acquisition of 
physiological signals on an emotion induced by an emotional 
stimulus. 6 males (20.8 years±1.26) and 6 females (21.2 
years±2.70) college students participated in this study. None 
of the subjects reported any history of medical illness or 
psychotropic medication and any medication that would

affect the cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous 
system. A written consent was obtained before the beginning 
of the experiment. 
A. Experimental Settings and Procedures 
The laboratory is a room of 5mⅹ2.5m size having a 
sound-proof (lower than 35dB) of the noise level where any 
outside noise or artifact are completely blocked. A 
comfortable chair is placed in the middle of the laboratory 
and 38 inch TV monitor set for presentation of film clips is 
placed in front of the chair. An intercommunication device is 
placed to the right side of chair for subjects to communicate 
with an experimenter. A CCTV is installed on the top of the 
monitor set to observe participant’s behaviours and their 
behaviours were storage through the monitor and a video 
cassette recorder outside the laboratory as shown in Fig.1. 
Prior to the experiment, subjects are introduced to detail 
experiment procedures and have an adaptation time to feel 
comfortable in the laboratory setting. Then they are attached 
electrodes on their wrist, finger, and ankle for measurement 
of physiological signals. Physiological signals are measured 
for 60 sec prior to the film clip presentation (baseline) and 
for 2 to 4 min during the presentation of the film clips 
(emotional state), then for 60 sec after presentation of the 
film clips as recovery term as shown in Fig. 2. Subjects rate 
the emotion that they experienced during presentation of the 
film clip on the emotion assessment scale. This procedure is 
conducted on each of the seven emotions for 10 times. 730 
physiological signal data except for severe artefact effect by 
movements, noises, etc. are used for analysis. 
B. Emotional Stimuli and Physiological Signalss 
To successfully induce the seven emotions (happiness, 
sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and stress), seventy 
emotional stimuli, which consist of 10 sets for the seven 
emotions, are used in the experiments. Emotional stimuli are 
constituted 2~4 min long audio-visual film clips which are 
captured originally from movies, documentary and TV 
shows such as victory, wedding, laughing, etc. for happiness, 
death of parents/lover, separation, longing for mother, etc. 
for sadness, massacre, beating, attack, etc. for anger, ghost, 
haunted house, scare, etc. for fear, body in pieces, vomiting, 
etc. for disgust, sudden or unexpected scream etc. for 
surprise, and audio/visual noise on screen, etc. for stress. 
Audio-visual film clips have widely used because these have 
the desirable properties of being readily standardized, 
involving no deception, and being dynamic rather than static. 
They also have a relatively high degree of ecological validity, 
in so far as emotions are often evoked by dynamic visual and 
auditory stimuli that are external to the individual [10-12]. 
The suitability and effectiveness of emotional stimuli are 
examined in preliminary study prior to an experiment. The 
suitability of emotional stimuli means the consistency 
between the target emotions designed to induce each 
emotion and the categories of participants’ experienced 
emotion. The effectiveness is determined by the intensity of 
emotions reported and rated by the subjects on a 1 to 11 
point Likert-type scale (e.g., 1 being “least happy” or “not 
happy” and 11 being “most happy”). Twenty-two college 
students, that are different group from participants in the 
experiment, categorize their experienced emotion into seven 
emotion and estimate intensity of their categorized emotion 
on emotional assessment scale after being presented each 
film clip. The Table 1 shows the results of the suitability and 
effectiveness of emotional stimuli gotten from in preliminary 
study. The emotional stimuli have the suitability of 93% and 
the effectiveness of 9.5 point on average of 10 sets as shown 
in the results. The suitability of each stimulus is ranged from 
75 to 100% and the effectiveness comes out from 8.4 to 10.4 
point as shown in results. 
The dataset of physiological signals such as skin 
temperature 
(SKT), 
electrodermal 
activity 
(EDA), 
photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
are collected by MP100 Biopac system Inc. (USA). SKT 
electrodes are attached on the first joint of non-dominant ring 
finger and on the first joint of the non-dominant thumb for 
PPG. EDA is measured with the use of 8 mm AgCl 
electrodes placed on the volar surface of the distal phalanges 
of the index and middle fingers of the non-dominant hand. 
Electrodes are filled with a 0.05 molar isotonic NaCl paste to 
provide a continuous connection between the electrodes and 
the skin. ECG electrodes are placed on both wrists and one 
left ankle with two kinds of electrodes, sputtered and AgCl 
ones. The left-ankle electrode is used as a reference.

The signals are acquired for 1 minute long baseline state 
prior to presentation of emotional stimuli and 2-4 minutes 
long emotional states during presentation of the stimuli. The 
obtained signals are analyzed for 30 seconds from the 
baseline and the emotional state by AcqKnowledge (Ver. 
3.8.1) software (USA). The emotional states are determined 
by the result of participant’s self-report (scene that emotion 
is most strongly expressed during presentation of each 
stimulus). 28 features extracted from the physiological 
signals and used to analysis are as follows: SCL, NSCR, 
meanSCR, meanSKT, maxSKT, meanPPG, meanRRI [ms],

IDENTIFICATION OF OPTIMAL EMOTION CLASSIFIER 
A. Two level processes for a classifier with feature 
selection 
For the classification of the seven emotions, the proposed 
classifier is a type of instance based learning that uses only 
specific instances to solve classification problem. Namely, 
the classifier is a method for classifying objects based on the 
closest training patterns called prototypes in the feature space. 
This classifier embraces two selection problems to classify a 
new pattern to a class. One is the selection of prototype 
patterns and another one is feature selection.  
  In light of these observations, we adopt two level 
optimization processes for the formation of the prototypes 
and the feature space. To format prototype, we start with 
choose P % of patterns using particle swarm optimization 
(PSO). The classifier generates classification predictions 
using only P % of patterns. The classifier does not use any 
model to fit and only is based on distance between a pattern 
and prototypes. Given a set of N prototypes, the classifier 
finds the one prototype closest in feature space to an 
unknown pattern, and then assigns the unknown pattern to 
the class label of its nearest prototype. The underlying 
distance between a pattern and a prototype is measured by 
weighted Euclidean one, that is

Where x and y are the two patterns in the n-dimensional 
space and σi is the standard deviation of the i-th feature 
whose value is computed using the prototype set. 
  Secondly, once the prototypes have been formed, we 
reduce feature space by choosing a core set of features 
encountered in the problem. Those features are regarded as 
the most essential ensemble of features that, organized 
together, exhibit the highest discriminatory capabilities. 
Often their number could be quite limited in comparison 
with the dimensionality of the overall feature space. One 
can consider d % of the total number of features, say 10%, 
20%, etc. The features forming the core have to be 
considered altogether. We use PSO to choose d % of 
features which minimizes the classification error. 
Overall, the algorithm can be outlined as the following 
sequence of steps 
Step 1: Randomly generate “N” particles, pi , and their 
velocities vi Each particle in the initial swarm (population) is 
evaluated using the objective function. For each particle, set 
pbesti=pi and search the best particle of pbest. Set the best 
particle associated with the global best, gbest. 
Step 2: Adjust the inertia weight, w. Typically, its values 
decrease linearly over the time of search. We start with 
wmax=0.9 at the beginning of the search and move down to 
wmin=0.4 at the end of the iterative process,

B. Prototypes and features versus PSO 
The underlying principle of PSO[13]  involves a 
population-based search in which individuals representing 
possible solutions carry out a collective search by 
exchanging their individual findings while taking into 
consideration their own experience and evaluating their own 
performance. PSO involves two competing search strategy 
aspects [14][15]. One deals with a social facet of the search; 
according to this, individuals ignore their own experience 
and adjust their behavior according to the successful beliefs 
of individuals occurring in their neighborhood. The 
cognition aspect of the search underlines the importance of 
the individual experience where the element of population is 
focused on its own history of performance and makes 
adjustments accordingly. PSO is conceptually simple, easy to 
implement, and computationally efficient. Unlike many other 
heuristic techniques, PSO has a flexible and well-balanced 
mechanism to enhance the global and local exploration 
abilities [15]. The basic elements of PSO technique are 
performance index (fitness), particles, best particles, and 
velocity. The particle is moving in the search space with 
some velocity which plays a pivotal role in the search 
process.  
As PSO is an iterative search strategy, we proceed until 
there is no substantial improvement of the fitness or we have 
exhausted the number of iterations allowed in this search. As 
a generic search strategy, the PSO has to be adjusted to solve 
a given optimization problem. There are two fundamental 
components that deserve our attention: a fitness function, and 
a representational form of the search space. Given the 
prototype formation and feature selection, we consider the 
minimization of the classification error as a suitable fitness 
measure. There could be different choices of the search space 
considering that an optimal collection of features could be 
represented in several different ways. Here we adopt the 
representation scheme of the search space in the form of the 
n-dimensional unit hypercube. The content of a chromosome 
is ranked viz. each value in this vector is associated with an 
index the given value assumes in the ordered sequence of all 
values encountered in the vector. Considering that we are 
concerned with d % of all features, we pick up the first d×n 
(0<d<1) entries of the vector of the search space. This 
produces a collection of features forming the reduced feature 
space. This mechanism of the formation of the feature space 
is portrayed in Fig. 3.  
For the entire patterns, the prototype formation is carried 
out in the same manner as we encountered in the feature 
selection. 
IV. 
NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS 
The numerical studies presented here provide some 
experimental evidence behind the effectiveness of the PSO 
approach. The detailed setup of an extensive suite of 
experiments is reflective of the methodology we outlined in 
the previous sections. The two essential parameters that we 
use in the assessment of the performance of prototype and 
feature selection are the percentage of features (denoted by

“d”) forming the core of the reduced feature space and the 
percentage of the data forming the prototype set (P) 
optimized by the PSO. The results are reported for the testing 
data sets for various values of “P” and “d”. 
The numeric values of the parameters of the PSO were 
either predetermined (considering some existing guidelines 
available in the literature, cf. [16][17]) or it becomes selected 
experimentally. More specifically, we used the following 
values of the parameters: maximum number of generations is 
500; swarm size is 150; maximal velocity, vmax, is 20% of the 
range of the corresponding variables; wmin=0.4; wmax=0.9; 
and acceleration constants c1 and c2 are set to 2.0. The inertia 
weight factor “w” has been regarded as a linearly decreasing 
function of iterations (optimization time) 
The seven emotional classes consist of happiness, 
sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and stress. The 
proposed prototype-based classifier is evaluated by 10 times 
repeated random sub-sampling validation for seven emotion 
classification. The 70% of the whole emotional patterns are 
selected randomly for training and the remaining patterns are 
used for testing purposes. The results are reported by 
presenting the average and standard deviation of the 
classification accuracy obtained over 10 repetitions of the 
experiment for the test dataset. When reporting results, we 
concentrate on the determination of relationships between 
the collections of features and obtained classification rates. 
We also look at the optimal subsets of features constructed 
with the use of the method. 
For the seven emotions dataset given as multi-
physiological 
signals, 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
percentage of features used in the PSO optimization, values 
of “P” and the resulting classification accuracy is presented 
in Table II. Here, “No. of F” is the number of selected 
features for d % of entire features, “AVG” and “STD” 
indicate average and standard deviation, respectively. 
The classification accuracy was computed over 10-fold 
realization of the experiments, namely, for each combination 
of the values of the parameters (d and P), the experiments 
was repeated 10 times by running PSO. 
With the increasing values of “d”, the classification 
accuracy of the seven emotions decreases substantially; in 
the case of P=30% it drops from 58.3 to 35.5 when 
increasing the number of features from 30% to 70%. The 
similar downward tendency occurs when dealing with any 
P % and considering the same increase in the percentage of 
features. Conclusively, the use of all features dropped 
accuracy of classification for the seven emotions. Changes in 
the values of “P” have far less effect on the classification rate, 
however, the distinguished result was occurred in d=30 and 
P=70. From these results, we observe that the number of 
suitable features is 8 and 70 % of dataset are required as the 
prototype for the seven emotion recognition using multi-
physiological signals. We report the number of occurrences 
of the features in Fig. 4 (a). The number of occurrences of a 
given feature is computed across all values of “P” and “d”. 
Interestingly, there are several dominant features such as 
FFTnHF (feature24), FFTLF/HFratio (feature 25), ARnLF 
(feature 26), ARnHF (feature 27), and ARLF/HFratio 
(feature 28). meanPPG (feature 6), meanHR (feature 9) and 
CSI (feature 15) are of lowest relevance. Prototypes were 
picked up by PSO as a supervisor of the classifier for each 
class and given patterns were assigned into a class through 
those and selected features. In case of d=30 for the 
classification of the seven emotions, namely, the number of 
features is 8, we have gotten that classification accuracy is 
90.3 % for P=70. PSO Fig. 4 (b) shows the fitness function 
of PSO. Therefore, we can consider than the number of core

features is eight and feature 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 
are selected on Fig. 4 (a). 
For the classification of the seven emotions, Table III 
contrasts the classification accuracy (%) of the proposed 
method with other well-known methods studied in the 
literatures [5-8]. As abovementioned, the experiments are 
reported for the 10 times using a split of data into 70%-30% 
training and testing subsets, namely, 70% of the whole 
patterns are selected randomly for training of all methods 
and the remaining patterns are used for testing purposes. The 
results are averaged over 10 times for testing dataset. The 
experimental results reveal that the proposed approach and 
the resulting model outperform the existing methods both in 
terms of the simpler structure and better prediction 
(generalization) capabilities on feature space reduced 70% of 
entire feature space.

CONCLUSION 
In this study, we have discussed the acquisition of multi-
physiology signals using emotion stimuli and the design of a 
classification methodology for the seven emotions.  The 
emotion stimuli used to induce a participant’s emotion were 
evaluated for their suitability and effectiveness. The result 
showed that emotional stimuli have the suitability of 93% 
and the effectiveness of 9.5 point on average. In addition 
that, we have introduced an instance-based learning 
classifier with feature selection learned by particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) mechanism for the seven emotions 
expressed by multi-physiological signals. The optimization 
process of forming the prototypes and the feature space is 
reflective of the conjecture on the importance of forming a 
set of prototypes and a core set of features whose 
discriminatory capabilities emerge through their co-
occurrence in these set. The methodology of feature 
selection 
becomes 
legitimate 
considering 
that 
we 
immediately see the result of the reduction of the feature 
space being translated into the corresponding classification 
rate. The use of the prototype is also justifiable considering 
that this classification scheme is the simplest that could be 
envisioned in pattern classification.
