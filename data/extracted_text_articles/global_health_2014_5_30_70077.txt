Abstract—Chlorpyriphos (CPF) is a pesticide widely 
used 
in 
agriculture, 
commercial, 
and 
domestic 
applications. CPF acts in part through inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase and thus can produce lasting effects 
on muscular system. However, the impact of chronic, 
low-dose exposure of CPF on mammalian muscles is 
poorly understood. In the present study, we examined in 
developing rats the effects of in utero and postnatal 
exposure to CPF, on contractile properties of the 
diaphragm, a respiratory skeletal muscle, and the 
digestive smooth muscles of the ileum. Wistar pregnant 
rats were administered by daily gavage from gestational 
day 1 to postnatal day 21 (PND21) with vehicle (control) 
or CPF at different doses: a low dose (1 mg/kg/d) and a 
high dose (5 mg/kg/d). At PND 21 and 60 the rats were 
sacrificed and both muscles of the ileum and the 
diaphragm were sampled for measurement. At PND60, 
there was a decrease in body weight of rats exposed to 1 
mg/kg/d of CPF. Rats exposed to 5 mg/kg/d of CPF 
showed a lower body weight at all ages studied. In 
addition, CPF exposure increases the twitch tension of 
the diaphragm at PND 21 and 60. For the ileum, there 
was a significant increase in the twitch tension (g/ cm2) 
of the smooth muscle at PND21 in both groups. In 
conclusion, chronic prenatal and postnatal exposures to 
CPF affect the contractility of both the diaphragm and 
ileal 
smooth 
muscles. 
Further 
investigations 
are 
required to explain these increases in the contractility.

INTRODUCTION  
 
Pesticides are unique contaminants in that they are 
intentionally released into the environment to elicit toxicity 
in certain “pest” species. Unfortunately, a lack of selectivity 
often leads to problems of toxicity in humans and other non-
target species. Organophosphorous (OP) pesticides are the 
major class of insecticides in the world today [1]. Poisoning 
with organophosphorous compounds is a global health 
problem. 
Organophosphorous 
compounds 
inhibit 
acetylcholinesterase 
resulting 
in 
accumulation 
of 
acetylcholine (Ach) and overstimulation of cholinergic 
synapses. Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter in 
both central and peripheral nervous system; in Central 
Nervous System (CNS), it is implicated in memory process 
and learning, and especially in muscle activity and 
vegetative functions; in peripheral nervous system (PNS), it 
is also implicated in the regulation of synaptogenesis [2]. 
The accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine 
causes hyperactivity in CNS and in neuromuscular 
junctions. Patients exposed to OP pesticides die mostly from 
respiratory failure and lung injury [3].  
Chlorpyriphos (CPF), O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-
pyridinyl)- phosphorothioate, was one of the most widely 
used OP insecticides in the U.S [1]. From 2000, all 
residential uses were banned. In the European Union, CPF 
is one of the widely used pesticides in agriculture with 
moderate toxicity with a rat oral lethal dose 50 (LD50) of 
135-163 mg/kg [4]. 
People are regularly exposed to a wide range of 
pesticides which are food contaminants. Studies on 
chlorpyriphos showed that prenatal CPF exposure was 
associated 
with 
intrauterine 
growth 
retardation 
and 
decreased 
birth 
weight 
[5][6][7][8], 
developmental 
neurotoxicity [9][10][11] after prenatal exposure and it is 
also associated with high risk of lung cancer and leukemia 
among agriculture workers [12]. 
Recent investigations have focused on the determination 
of the mechanisms behind the age-related toxicity 
differences, since juveniles are more susceptible [13], and 
on the alterations resulting from repeated exposure during 
development. Moreover, there are numerous studies in

animals following acute [14] or chronic exposure to CPF 
[15] showing a significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase 
activity in brain, diaphragm, liver, retina and blood cells and 
a decrease in muscarinic receptor (QNB) binding in brain, 
heart and retina during critical periods of development 
[16][17][18] or in adulthood [17].  
Our objective was to investigate the effects of repeated 
gestational and postnatal exposure to CPF on the 
contractility of the respiratory muscle (diaphragm) and 
longitudinal smooth muscle of the ileum in Wistar rats and 
to determine the mechanism by which the contractility is 
affected. Such an investigation cannot be performed in 
humans. In this paper, we show the effects of chlorpyriphos 
exposure on body weight, survival rate, and the in vitro 
contractility properties of both diaphragm and longitudinal 
smooth muscle of ileum.  
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The methods used in our experiments are summarized in 
the sections below. 
A.  Chemicals  
Chlorpyriphos 
(O,O-diethyl 
O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-
pyridinyl)- phosphorothioate, purity 99.8%) was purchased 
from LGC standards SARL (6, Rue Alfred Kastler, 83076, 
MOLSHEIM, France). It was dissolved in commercially 
available rapeseed oil (the vehicle) at dose of 1 mg/ml (for 
the CPF1 group) and 5 mg/ml (for the CPF5 group) in order 
to expose animals to 1 or 5 mg/ml/kg body mass/day. Other 
biochemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical C 
(L'Isle d'Abeau Chesnes, 38297 Saint-Quentin Fallavier, 
France).  
B.  Experimental Design  
Twelve female and 6 male Wistar rats (aged 8 weeks on 
arrival, body mass 250-300 g) were obtained from Janvier 
LABS (Le Genest Saint Isle Saint Berthevin, 53941 France). 
All animals were housed in cages in a controlled-temperature 
(23°C) room with a 12:12 h alternating light:dark cycle. 
They were maintained on a standard pelleted diet, with tap 
water ad libitum. After a 1-week acclimation period, females 
were mated with males and pregnancy was determined by 
the presence of spermatozoa in the vagina checked with a 
smear. After fertilization, female rats were individually 
housed in clean plastic cages and randomly assigned to a 
treatment group or control group. Pregnant rats were exposed 
by gavage from gestational day 1 (GD1) to the post natal day 
(PND21) at different doses: 1 mg/kg/d (CPF1) and 5 
mg/kg/d (CPF5) vs vehicle. After weaning at PND21, pups 
were administered with the same doses of CPF until day 60 
of age (PND60). Hence, pups were studied at two time 
points: weaning day (PND21) after gestational and 
lactational exposition and in adulthood (PND60) after further 
exposition to CPF in food.  
C. Sample collection 
At day 21, half of rats were euthanized with an 
intraperitoneal overdose of sodium pentobarbital (1 ml/kg; 
200mg/ml solution) and muscles of both diaphragm and 
ileum were sampled for measurement of contractile 
properties. The second half of rats was weaned and 
administered with the same doses of CPF until day 60 of age 
(PND60). They were sacrificed and the contractile properties 
of their muscles studied.  
D. Organ bath physiology 
After euthanasia, the diaphragm and pieces of ileum were 
removed. Muscle strips were mounted in organ bath 
containing oxygenated Krebs solution at 37°C and pH 7.4. 
After 30min equilibration period, the ileal segments were 
stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS) (100 v- 32 
Hz). For the diaphragm segments, fatigue was induced by 
application of a low frequency fatigue protocol consisting of 
supramaximal stimuli (2 Hz, 2 ms, 12 V) delivered directly 
to the muscle for 5 min for induction of fatigue.  
E. Statistical analysis 
Statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 
5 software (graphPad software, Inc, San Diego, California) . 
If groups were significantly different in in a one-way 
ANOVA test, an impaired t test was then performed. 
Statistical significance is reported for the p≤0.05. Values 
were expressed as the mean±SEM.  
III. 
RESULTS 
Our results obtained are exposed in the sections below. 
A. Effect of CPF exposure on body mass and mortality of 
pups 
Figure 1 shows that at birth and PND21 there was no 
difference in body mass of rats exposed to CPF1 compared 
to controls. However, at PND60, body mass of CPF1 rats 
was significantly decreased. Body mass of rats exposed to 5 
mg/kg/d of CPF was significantly lower than control at birth, 
PND21 and PND60.

It should be noted that deaths occurred essentially 
between PND01 and PND21 in pups exposed during in utero 
and postnatal periods to CPF5 (Table I).

B. In vitro muscle contractility 
At PND 21 and PND 60, the diaphragm shows a 
significant increase in twitch tension after oral exposure to 
CPF at doses CPF1 and CPF5, as depicted in Figure 2.  
 
However, only at PND60, the fatigability index was 
higher in CPF5 group compared to controls, as shown in 
Figure 3. 
 
 
The EFS-stimulation of ileal segments of exposed rats 
showed a significant increase in the amplitude of contraction 
at PND21 and a significant decrease in the amplitude of 
contraction at PND60, as presented in Figure 4. 
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The data from this study show that in utero and postnatal 
chlorpyriphos exposure alters the contractility of diaphragm 
and smooth muscle of ileum. Organophosphorus (OP) 
insecticides 
elicit 
toxicity 
through 
inhibition 
of 
acetylcholinesterase, 
leading 
to 
accumulation 
of 
acetylcholine in the nervous system and consequent signs of 
cholinergic toxicity [19]. Our results show that perinatal 
exposure of rat pups to low dose CPF has an impact on 
growth, with lower body weight in CPF1 group at adulthood 
and in CPF5 group at birth, PND21 and PND60 as described 
by Mansour and Moussa [20]. 
This study was designed to investigate, for the first time, 
the effects of chlorpyriphos exposure from the first day of 
gestation to the post natal day (PND21) and to adulthood 
(PND60) on the contractility of diaphragm and smooth 
muscle of ileum. As expected, the exposure to CPF alters the 
contractility of diaphragm and ileal smooth muscle. At 
PND21 and PND60 the twitch tension of diaphragm was 
significantly increased in both CPF1 and CPF5 group. This 
can be explained by the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase 
in the neuromuscular junction and will be confirmed by the 
dosage of acetylcholinesterase activity. Previous studies 
reported 
decreased 
acetylcholinesterase 
activity 
in 
diaphragm following repeated oral postnatal exposure to 
CPF from PND1 to PND21 [16] and in adult rats [14]. 
Furthermore, the fatigability index was higher in adult rats 
exposed to CPF5. This can be related to the protein content, 
the calcium intake or the neuromuscular junction structure. 
Further experiments are required to explain this increase. 
The amplitude of contraction of the ileal longitudinal smooth 
muscle of the ileum was increased in the rats exposed to both 
CPF1 and CPF5 doses at PND21. However, at PND60, the

amplitude of contraction was decreased in exposed group.   
This can be explained by the difference of administration of 
CPF: at PND21, rats were exposed to CPF in utero and via 
lactation; the chlorpyriphos is mostly detoxified by the 
organism of the mother. After weaning up to day 60, 
intestinal tract is directly in contact with CPF. Those features 
may provide an explanation for the difference observed 
between the two age groups. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
The chronic, low-dose oral exposure to CPF from day 
one of gestation to postnatal day 60 alters the contraction of 
skeletal respiratory muscle, and longitudinal ileal smooth 
muscle in juvenile and adult rats. These effects could alter 
the respiratory pattern and the intestinal transit which will be 
investigated in future. These findings suggest that the 
pesticides exposure should be avoided as much as possible. 
The mechanisms that lead to the increase in the contractility 
have to be investigated. This change in the contractility of 
the muscle can be related to modification of the muscle 
structure including muscle fibers distribution, myofibrillar 
protein and/or RNA content. Thus, further investigations are 
needed in order to explain these muscle alterations.
