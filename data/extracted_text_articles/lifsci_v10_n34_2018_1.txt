 Abstract-The microbiological quality of tahini produced by 
several manufacturers in Lebanon was evaluated. Sixty-three 
tahini samples were collected randomly from retail markets 
throughout the country with production dates ranging from 
October 2015 to September 2017. The majority of the samples 
were from companies that are international exporters of the 
product. Nine of the obtained samples were from a traditional 
tahini manufacturer. All samples were assessed for the total 
Aerobic Plate Count, the presence and enumeration of 
Staphylococcus aureus, yeasts and molds, Salmonella, coliforms 
and Escherichia coli. Spread plate methods were used for 
detection and enumeration. The following results were 
obtained: the Aerobic Plate Count of the samples ranged 
between 1x102 CFU/g and 8.2x105 CFU/g with an average of 
8.2x104 CFU/g. S. aureus counts ranged between <20 CFU/g 
and 9.2x103 CFU/g with an average of 8.3x102 CFU/g. Yeasts 
and molds were present at counts ranging from <10 CFU/g to 
2.2x105 CFU/g with an average of 2.5x104 CFU/g. Total 
coliform counts ranged between <30 CFU/g and 3.4x105 CFU/g 
with an average of 2.3x104 CFU/g. E. coli was present in ~37% 
of the samples (23 out of 63), while Salmonella was confirmed 
present in ~16% of the samples (10 out of 63). When compared 
with local and international standards, many of the samples 
showed unacceptable levels of microbial contamination. 
Certain impact factors were also determined when the samples 
were grouped according to their respective manufacturer, age, 
and processing method.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Tahini is a well-known Middle Eastern condiment made 
from toasted ground hulled sesame seeds [1]. The paste has 
gained popularity all over the globe as a result of its health 
and culinary benefits [2]. In 2014, the Middle East and 
Mediterranean tahini market was estimated to be at a value 
of $783.9 Million, with forecasts of a further escalation by 
2020. Lebanon has been an important exporter of tahini, and 
is home to many key players in the market [3]. 
The importance of tahini comes from the fact that it is 
used commercially and at a household level as an ingredient 
in many cultural delicacies. These include products that 
have gained international popularity, such as hummus 
(chickpeas with tahini), and mtabal betejen (roasted 
eggplant and tahini) [4]. The paste is also used as a sauce for 
meats like shawarma, and as a sauce (known as tarator) for 
fish and falafel. Tahini also makes up about 50% of halva 
(or halawa), a sweet made up of tahini, sugar, citric acid and 
Saponaria officinalis root extract [5]. Tahini is of high 
nutritive value. It is rich in lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, 
niacin, thiamin, and some minerals like calcium, and 
phosphorous [6]. The traditional way of tahini processing in 
Lebanon includes: sorting the seeds to remove dark or 
imperfect seeds, followed by soaking the seeds in salt water. 
This helps settle impurities and dirt at the bottom and ease 
the peeling process. The seeds that are floating on the 
surface of the water are then collected, peeled and washed. 
The next step involves roasting the seeds, followed by the 
stone-grinding phase, which brings out the oil in the sesame 
and turns it into a paste. Many tahini manufacturers, 
however, rely on a fully automated process. Instead of 
soaking the seeds in salt water, they are passed into a 
centrifuge that separates any impurities. The sesame then 
enters a washing machine, followed by a drying machine 
and then a roaster. The roasted sesame is cleaned once again 
and sorted by color. The accepted seeds then undergo 
grinding, are homogenized and then finally pasteurized at a 
high temperature for several hours to get rid of any potential 
bacteria [7][8] (Figure 1).

After production tahini is stored at room temperature 
and has a shelf life up to 2 years [9]. It is typically 
consumed directly and does not require any further 
processing. Therefore, it should be free from any pathogenic 
bacteria upon packaging. The raw sesame itself should also 
be free from microbes, so as not to increase the risk of 
contamination [10]. However, despite the development of a 
hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) plan for the 
manufacturing of tahini [11], in recent years, sesame paste 
has emerged as a product of concern, with many of the end 
products containing Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Escherichia coli, and a number of other hazardous 
microbes. In addition tahini has a low water activity (~0.16) 
as well as low pH (~5.9) [11], conditions that permit the 
growth of many foodborne microorganisms [12]. 
The presence of microbes has been attributed to a 
number of reasons including, the microbial quality of 
sesame seeds, poor hygiene and sanitation, and improper 
processing and storage conditions [10]. Outbreaks of 
Salmonella infections have been traced back to tahini, some 
particularly correlated with Lebanese products [13]. Though 
some studies have dealt with the microbiological quality of 
sesame seed products, a collective investigation into tahini 
products in Lebanon using conventional plating methods 
has yet to be established. Therefore, the objective of this 
study will be to detect and enumerate microbial 
contamination of tahini in Lebanon, while also checking for 
possible impact factors including the processing method, 
storage time, or difference among products due to difference 
in manufacturer. 
This paper includes four sections. Aside from the 
introduction, Section II includes a detailed description of the 
materials and methods used in the study. In Section III we 
mention the microbial results obtained and whether 
grouping the samples according to their corresponding 
manufacturer, method of processing, or sample age may 
have had an impact on the obtained results, which we 
discuss in accordance to similar studies. In the final section, 
Section IV, we wrap up our research in a concluding 
statement and mention some limitations, as well as possible 
future work in the related area. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Sampling 
 
Sixty-three tahini samples with production dates varying 
from October 2015 to September 2017 were collected from 
retailers and producers throughout certain areas in Lebanon. 
Nine of the samples were obtained from a traditional 
manufacturer (no automated machinery). Sample weights 
varied between 200g and 900g. All samples were held at 
room temperature (250C) and collected in their original 
packages, which were wiped with ethanol before testing. 
The samples were given a letter based on the manufacturer 
as shown in Table I. Using a sterilized rod, the samples were 
thoroughly mixed. 25 g of each sample were then 
transferred aseptically into separate sterile plastic bags 
containing 225 ml of buffered peptone water for 
homogenization. Homogenization was carried out using a 
stomacher (Model, 1605 BL Smart) for 2 minutes. 
Following homogenization ten-fold serial dilutions up to 103 
were prepared, and inoculated on appropriate media. 
B. Microbial Analysis 
Aerobic Plate Counts (APC), Staphylococcus aureus, 
coliforms, and yeasts/mold counts were determined for each 
sample, as well as the presence or absence of Escherichia 
coli, and Salmonella. 
Aerobic Plate Count.  APC was determined according to 
the procedure specified by Morton R.D [14]. 0.1 ml of each 
dilution was inoculated and spread onto Plate Count Agar 
(PCA) (HiMedia) and left to dry. The plates were then 
incubated at 35±10C for 48 ± 2 hours. 
Staphylococcus aureus.  S. aureus was detected and 
enumerated via surface plating 0.5 ml on Mannitol Salt 
Agar (MSA) (HiMedia) and incubating plates at 35±10C for 
48 ±2 hours. Colonies with typical and atypical S. aureus 
morphology were confirmed by the catalase and coagulase 
tests. This method is in accordance with that specified by 
the British Standards Institution, with a modification of the 
agar [15]. 
Yeast and Mold.  Yeast and mold counts were determined 
following spread plate inoculation onto Saubaurad Dextrose 
Agar (SDA) (HiMedia). Plates were incubated at 25 ±10C for 5 
days. This procedure was taken from the United States Food 
and Drug administration (FDA) [16] however the proposed 
agar was substituted with SDA. 
Total coliforms and Escherichia coli.  Total coliforms 
were enumerated on Eosin Methylene Blue Agar (EMB) 
(HiMedia) [17]. An addition to the procedure determined by 
Gehm & Heukelekian included pre-enrichment of 1 ml of 
the samples with 10 ml Lactose Broth (HiMedia) for 48 
hours, at an incubation temp of 35 ±10C. Following the pre-
enrichment step, 1 ml of each dilution was surface plated 
onto EMB agar plates and incubated at 35±1 0C for 48 ±2 
hours. Plates with typical E. coli colonies were confirmed 
for presence of the bacteria via biochemical IMViC tests 
(HiMedia).  
Salmonella.  For detecting Salmonella, the FDA 
Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) procedure was 
implemented, with some modifications [18]. Pre-enrichment 
was carried out by suspending 25g of each sample in 225ml 
of Lactose Broth (HiMedia), followed by incubation at 
35±10C for 24±2 hours. 1 ml of each sample was then 
transferred to 10 ml tubes of Selenite F Broth (SFB) 
(HiMedia) and incubated at 35±10C for 24±2 hours. After 
incubation, 3 mm loopfuls were streaked onto Salmonella 
Shigella agar (SS)(HiMedia) and incubated for another 24 
±2 hours. Typical and atypical colonies for presumptive 
Salmonella were then transferred to Kliger Iron Agar (KIA) 
(HiMedia). Confirmation was carried out via IMViC 
biochemical tests (HiMedia), Urea Broth (HiMedia), and 
Phenol D broth (HiMedia). 
C. Statistical analysis 
The data was analyzed using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) completely randomized design. Differences

among means of the treatments were analyzed using 
Duncan. Significant differences were determined when 
p≤0.05. Significant differences for means obtained after 
grouping the samples based on the processing method, were 
determined using independent t-test analysis. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Microbial Counts 
APC, S. aureus, total coliform, and yeast and mold 
counts, as well as the presence or absence of Salmonella and 
E. coli obtained following assessment of sixty-three tahini 
samples in Lebanon are shown in Table I. APCs for the 
samples ranged between 1x102 colony forming unit per 
gram (CFU/g) and 8.2x105 CFU/g with an average of 
8.2x104 CFU/g. S. aureus counts ranged between <20 
CFU/g and 9.2x103 CFU/g with an average of 8.3x102 
CFU/g. Yeasts and molds were present at counts ranging 
from <10 CFU/g to 2.2x105 CFU/g with an average of 
2.5x104 CFU/g. Total coliform counts ranged between <30 
CFU/g and 3.4x105 CFU/g with an average of 2.3x104 
CFU/g. E. coli was present in 36.5% of the samples (23 out 
of 63), while Salmonella was confirmed present in 15.9% of 
the samples (10 out of  63). 
Similar studies have been done on the microbial quality 
of tahini and similar results were obtained. A similar study 
in Saudi Arabia, revealed APC levels for 50 tahini samples 
at an average of 2x104 CFU/g, slightly lower than the 
obtained average of the current study [19]. Another study on 
tahini samples, assessed directly after manufacturing and 4 
months after production, was done in Jordan, and the 
highest average for APC of 5.3x103 CFU/g was still lower 
than the obtained average [11]. Al-Sogair et al. (1986) 
revealed lower averages for S. aureus at 56 CFU/g and 
much lower levels of yeast and mold, ranging from <10 to 
50 CFU/g [19]. Yamani & Isa (2006) determined S. aureus 
levels to also be at 54 CFU/g respectively while the average 
for yeast and mold counts was 1x102 CFU/g [11]. The 
current average value for total coliform counts was 2.3x104 
CFU/g, also a high average compared to average counts of 
49 CFU/g, and 6x102 CFU/g for comparable studies 
[19][11]. 
This is not the first time Salmonella is detected in tahini. 
The microbial assessment of tahini samples on the shelves 
of retail markets has led to the recall of some products 
[20][13]. Al-Sogair et al. (1986), in a similar study, detected 
Salmonella in 20% of the examined samples as well [19].  
The microbial quality of sesame paste products, such as 
halva and hummus, have also been investigated. Figure 2 
compares microbial counts obtained from some literature 
with those obtained from Lebanese manufactured tahini 
associated with this study, and shows somewhat similar 
results. However, S. aureus levels were the highest in tahini 
manufactured in Lebanon, while APC and total coliform 
counts were also the second highest compared to other 
literature. Comparing these values to standards of 
acceptance will determine just how much of a health hazard 
Lebanese tahini is.

[11], [19], [21],[22], [23], [24], [25] were used.  
B. Comparing Microbial Levels to Local and International 
Standards  
Lebanese standards set the maximum limit for APCs, 
yeast and molds, E. coli and Salmonella at 1x104 CFU/g, 
1x103 CFU/g, 10 CFU/g, and 0 CFU/g respectively, beyond 
which microbial content could prove hazardous upon 
consumption [26]. As seen in Table II, a considerable 
amount of the samples analyzed contained unacceptable 
microbial content. Almost half of the samples, (46%) 
contained unacceptable quantities of APC, while more than 
half of the samples showed unacceptable quantities of S. 
aureus (52%), yeast and mold quantities (67%), and coliform 
counts (83%). E. coli was detected in 37% of the samples. 
Even minute amounts of Salmonella are detrimental to one’s 
health and therefore 16% of the samples were found to be 
hazardous.   
Standards available from the Gulf countries set the limit 
for APCs, S. aureus, and yeast and molds in tahini at 107, 
102, and 103 CFU/g [27]. Similar studies and other official 
institutions have also set acceptable standards for tahini and 
ready-to-eat foods, as shown in Table III. According to Table 
III, the highest levels of acceptable microbial counts for 
APC, S. aureus, yeasts and molds, total coliforms, E. coli 
and Salmonella in CFU/g were as follows: 107 [27], 104 [28], 
<106 [28], 102 [28][29], <10 [26], <3 [29].

When compared to those standards, the APC, S. aureus, 
and yeast and mold counts for all the examined samples in 
this study are considered acceptable. However, many 
samples would still remain unacceptable with regards to total 
coliform counts, and the presence of E. coli and Salmonella. 
None of the tested samples should contain Salmonella due to 
its characteristic as a health hazard. According to GSO 
standards, none of the samples should contain even traces of 
E. coli [27]. The remaining samples should contain microbial 
levels below the acceptable limits in order to indicate good

C. Impact Factors 
Furthermore, the samples were grouped according to 
their respective manufacturer, processing method, and 
storage time, in order to identify certain impact factors.  
Impact by manufacturer.  Table IV shows the results 
obtained when the samples were grouped according to the 
manufacturer (also refer to figures 3 & 4). This is determined 
by ANOVA analysis, with significance indicated by a 95% 
confidence interval. Significant differences were seen for S. 
aureus counts, yeast and molds, and for the presence of 
Salmonella. For S. aureus counts, companies F and C 
showed significantly higher levels of average counts 
compared to other manufacturers. Manufacturer C also 
showed significantly higher levels of yeast and molds. 
Meanwhile manufacturers D, and G showed no signs of 
Salmonella, compared to other companies and differed 
significantly from company E, which showed the highest 
prevalence of Salmonella in the tested samples. No 
significant differences were detected for APC, coliform, and 
E. coli counts.  Therefore there seems to be slight 
differences in microbial quality depending on the 
manufacturer, as well as the microbe under investigation. 
These results are consistent with a similar study that 
determined significant differences between samples of 
tahini produced by different manufacturers [11]. The 
variations in microbial levels could be due to different 
manufacturing procedures and processing parameters. For 
example, the temperature and time of roasting for one 
manufacturer may be more efficient for reducing microbial 
levels than the time and temperature implemented by a 
different company. Also, the source of sesame seeds and 
water may differ according to manufacturer, which may also 
depend on the place of production. Another factor could be 
the temperature of the facility. Companies that are located in 
areas with elevated heights usually experience lower 
temperatures than companies located in coastal areas. 
Therefore, processing and storage conditions that favor the 
growth of microbes may lead to the variations in microbial 
levels, which could drastically increase in hot, humid areas.

Figure 4.  Prevalence of E. coli and Salmonella in tahini after grouping 
samples according to manufacturer  
Another aspect may be the enforcement of HACCP 
plans and GMPs for production. Although the Lebanese 
government requires this, adherences to the regulations may 
be strictly enforced in one company yet loosely enforced in 
another. Whether or not the manufacturer produces tahini 
via the traditional or modern method may also play a role in 
determining levels of contamination as will be discussed. 
Impact of Processing Method.  The tahini samples were 
also grouped based on the processing method, i.e., whether 
the samples were produced via the traditional or modern 
method (solely automated machinery), and results were 
statistically interpreted based on a confidence interval of 
95%. Significance was obtained via independent t-test 
analysis. Results are shown in Table V and Figures 5 & 6.  
APCs were slightly higher for tahini produced by the 
modern method (9.2x104 CFU/g) in comparison to the 
average APC levels for tahini produced by the traditional 
method (2x104 CFU/g). The p-value for the differences was 
≤0.05 and therefore it was significant. For average levels of 
S. aureus, tahini produced by the traditional method showed 
significantly lower counts (73 CFU/g) than tahini produced 
by the modern method (9.6x102 CFU/g). The p-value for S.  
aureus averages was also ≤0.05 and therefore the 
differences were significant. In the case of yeast and molds, 
the average for tahini produced by the modern method was 
slighter higher than the average for tahini produced by the 
traditional method. However, statistical analysis shows that 
this difference is not significant (Table V). Meanwhile, the 
average for total coliforms was 2.6x103 CFU/g for 
traditionally produced tahini, and 2.7x104 CFU/g for tahini 
produced by the modern method, with a p-value ≤0.05, 
which signals significant differences. Meanwhile, although 
there appeared to be a somewhat recognizable difference in 
E. coli levels, statistical analysis indicates that there is no 
significant difference between both groups for E. coli counts 
(p>0.05).  
Additionally, no Salmonella was detected in tahini 
produced via traditional methods. All the samples 
containing Salmonella were produced by the modern 
method and this difference was also significant (p≤0.05). 
Hence, it appears that the manufacturing of tahini via the 
modern “machinery” method is contributing to higher 
microbial levels in the products.  
In a similar study however, tahini samples produced by 
the traditional method came out as more contaminated than 
samples produced by the automated method with regards to 
average APCs, and S. aureus counts [11], however the 
study’s results were consistent with our findings with 
regards to average counts for yeast and molds, which were 
higher for the modern manufacturing process.

It would have been expected that products obtained from 
traditional manufacturers contain higher levels of microbes, 
than products produced modernly due to a number of 
reasons including: lack of knowledge in HACCP principles, 
or the adherence to traditional production methods that may 
sometimes be unsanitary, as well as, the need to incorporate 
many staff members in small companies, which large 
manufacturing industries replace with machines. However, 
this was not the case in this study’s findings. Therefore, the 
reason behind the high microbial levels is most likely due to 
the source of water used in production, as well as the 
roasting time. The traditional manufacturer usually roasts 
the seeds until confident that the seeds are free from 
contamination, usually determined by certain indicators, 
such as the color, smell, etc. Roasting in a modern industry, 
however, is done via a machine with fixated time and 
temperature, and whether or not all the seeds have been 
roasted to the sufficient level, they will move along on the 
processing line and any microbial growth will remain. 
Furthermore, seeds that are stored in large industries are 
packed together in large amounts. This atmosphere 
increases chances for microbial growth specifically, yeast 
and mold. Another factor could be difficulty in accessing 
guidelines for standards, safety procedures, and GMP 
policies, which are not readily available in Lebanon.

Impact of Storage Time.  The impact of the storage time 
was also assessed and the results of the statistical outcomes 
for the microbial counts are shown in Table VI (refer also to 
Figures 7&8). The samples were grouped based on whether 
the product was obtained directly from the manufacturer 
(fresh) or whether it spent a certain period of time (from 1 
month to over 10 months) on the shelf. There were no 
significant 
differences 
among 
the 
samples 
with 
consideration for the sample age (p>0.05). Therefore the 
storage time seemed to have no significant impact on the 
microbial quality.  
Although microbial counts were higher in products with 
a shelf life of over three months, products with shelf lives of 
over ten months showed sharp decreases in microbial 
quality. The fresh samples also appeared to have lower 
microbial qualities than older samples, yet similar to levels 
attained by samples over ten months.  
In a similar study however, the microbial counts of 
tahini were seen to have significantly decreased after four 
months of storage [11]. The variations in our findings could 
be due to the fact it was not the same fresh sample but rather

Regardless however, it is evident that fresh samples and 
aged samples are vulnerable to microbial contamination. In 
addition, the results of the current study are uniform with 
results of similar studies that proved the existence of 
hazardous microbes in sesame paste products even after 
prolonged storage time. 
Al-Holy et al. (2017) witnessed a decrease in Salmonella 
counts in halva with increased storage time [32]. The 
decrease in microbial levels could be due to bacterial 
competition for resources, which are limited in vacuum-
sealed packages. However, even after a long period, the 
microbe was still present in hazardous levels, possibly due 
to the protective effect of high fat low moisture foods, for 
some bacteria [33][34]. Bacteria do not generally survive in 
dry environments, but some are able to survive in a dormant 
state, and when conditions are suitable once again, they are 
active, as is the case for Salmonella. Similar studies found 
that Salmonella survived in tahini even after 16 weeks of 
storage [35]. Salmonella was also seen to survive in tahini 
up to 8 months [36]. Meanwhile, Al-Holy et al. (2013) 
found that E. coli survived in tahini after 28 days of storage 
[37]. In halva, S. aureus was still present in the samples 
even after 9 months [23]. 
Tahini has a low water activity, and low water activity 
foods are considered safe from microbial contamination. 
However, this has not been the case. In the United States, 
5,141 low-water activity food products were recalled from 
2007 to 2012, due to bacterial pathogens [38]. Foodborne 
and waterborne pathogens can have deteriorative impacts on 
the quality of food, negative consequences to a person’s 
health, and remain a major source for the spread of disease 
worldwide [40]. In general, contamination may occur from 
the use of contaminated water during washing, soaking, or 
brining, or cross contamination during processes that are 
open to air, for example, grinding or filling, or bad storage 
conditions within the factory [10]. 
On a more specific front, S. aureus often enter foods 
from the skin surfaces of employees [39]. The bacteria can 
be airborne and therefore exposure to the atmosphere for 
long periods of time can lead to high S. aureus counts. 
Major health implications can result from high microbial 
counts of S. aureus, which can also include toxin production 
[40].

Figure 8.  Prevalence of E. coli and Salmonella in tahini samples grouped 
according to sample age 
Yeasts and molds are distributed widely in the 
environment as contaminants of air, water, soil and dust and 
present a potential threat due to mycotoxin production and 
allergic reactions [41]. During the study worms emerged on 
SDA agar, indicating the presence of insect eggs within the 
corresponding samples. Insect eggs can come as a result of 
improper handling and storage conditions and can also have 
negative implications to a person’s health.  
Coliforms on the other hand, principally E. coli, are 
widely used as indicators of human fecal contamination. 
Coliforms can cause gastrointestinal infections, and some 
strains of E. coli are also capable of causing serious kidney 
disease and can be fatal [39]. Presence of high coliform 
counts in food has been attributed to use of contaminated 
water during manufacturing [10]. Another microbe with fatal 
consequences upon ingestion is Salmonella. Various 
Salmonella species are commonly the etiological agents of 
salmonellosis, bacteremia, and typhoid fever, which require 
only minute amounts of Salmonella typhi [39]. The most 
commonly identified sources of Salmonella infections 
include birds and domestic fowl, including their eggs [39]. 
Contaminated water supplies and the handling of food 
products by individuals infected with this bacterium, could 
also lead to the spread of the microbe [10]. Insects, as well, 
are capable of transferring Salmonella upon ingestion or 
physical contact [42]. Inadequate roasting temperatures 
could lead to inadequate removal of Salmonella [10]. 
The obtained results indicate that some tahini produced 
in Lebanon is hazardous and could pose life-threatening 
consequences. In addition, about 35 percent of tahini 
produced in the country is exported, specifically to the USA, 
EU, Australia and the GCC. The products tested in this study 
include some of the country’s major producers and exporters. 
The fact that Lebanese tahini has had incidents where 
Salmonella was detected, has reduced the quantities for 
export, especially to the USA [43]. Therefore the results 
indicate that Lebanese tahini could also have threatening 
consequences to health on a global scale, or to the country’s 
profits from tahini exports. 
This is the first collective study in Lebanon that 
determines the quality of tahini produced in the country by 
studying the microbial quality of the products via 
conventional plating methods, while also considering the 
sample age as well as the processing methods as possible 
impact factors. Although the paper does only consider 
Lebanese products, it is worth noting that all the studied 
samples are from companies that export tahini worldwide, 
making the problem a global concern. Also, other major 
worldwide exporters (e.g., Turkish, Jordanian, and Saudi 
Arabian companies) also carried out similar studies on the 
microbial quality of tahini and other sesame paste products, 
in their respective countries [9][11][19], and hence, this 
study is to complement the others. Furthermore the discovery 
of contaminated tahini products in other countries, (Turkey, 
Jordon, and Saudi Arabia) [9][11][19] motivated us to test 
the quality of tahini in Lebanon. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The results of this study provided an evaluation into the 
microbial quality of sixty-three tahini products manufactured 
in Lebanon and showed that some products are unacceptable 
in accordance to local and international standards. The 
results were also determined to be somewhat influenced by 
the manufacturer, to which each sample belonged to, the 
processing method used for production, as well as the time 
the sample spent on the shelf.  
Limitations include unequal sample sizes for the different 
factors studied (sample age, processing method) due to 
limited resources, and the randomization procedure. 
Further testing will be required to determine the source of 
contamination in order to contain it. Furthermore, the study 
could be a basis for further research aimed to eradicate high 
microbial counts in tahini without impacting the overall 
physiochemical quality. A number of recommendations are 
advised for the government, industry, and consumer.  
It is recommended that tahini manufacturers, as should be 
the case with all food manufacturers of ready-to-eat foods, 
adhere to and strictly enforce Good Manufacturing 
Procedures (GMPs), and HACCP procedures, and amend 
regulations if need be the case.  
It is also recommended that further inspection of tahini, 
as well as other sesame seed products be tested for microbial 
stability to ensure safe manufacturing of products.  
It is also advised that food manufacturing facilities 
implement HACCP plans set by the government, and when 
violations of such plans due occur, it is advised that severe 
consequences are imposed. Furthermore, strict regulations 
should ensure that exported tahini meets the regulations of 
the target countries to prevent recalls. It is suggested that 
government standards, HACCP plans, safety procedures, and 
other regulations be readily available to the manufacturer in 
order to encourage and ease implementation of GMPs.
