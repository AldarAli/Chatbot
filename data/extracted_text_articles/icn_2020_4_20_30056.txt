Abstract—In recent years, a large number of Access Points (APs)
have been deployed in public facilities such as stations and
airports. These allow users with wireless devices to select their
APs from several APs. In general, the communication quality
depends on the selected APs, and thus the AP selection is an
important technical issue. In this paper, we propose an access-
point and channel selection method based on Received Signal
Strength Indication (RSSI) value using Markov approximation.
In Markov approximation, the system is optimized by individual
behavior of users forming a time-reversible continuous-time
Markov chain. In the proposed method, to suppress frequent
and useless state transitions, users do not select APs with small
RSSI values. This reduces the number of state transitions, and
thus the time-average objective function value can be increased
rapidly. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.
Keywords–Access point selection; channel selection; Markov
approximation; RSSI.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, wireless LANs have become increasingly
common, and Access Points (APs) have been deployed with
very high density [1][2]. In particular, the number of APs
deployed in public facilities, such as stations and airports, has
increased rapidly. This allows users with wireless devices to
select the APs that they can connect from several APs. In
general, the communication quality depends on AP selection,
and thus the AP selection is an important technical issue.
In the existing AP selection method [1][3], the AP with
the highest Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which
is an indicator of the received signal power strength, is selected
from the APs within the communication range of each user’s
device. Because each user selects an AP independently, the
user selections are concentrated to the AP with the highest
RSSI even when there are other APs nearby. As the load on the
AP increases, the throughput decreases, and thus the existing
AP selection method does not work well.
In order to solve this problem, other AP selection methods
have been considered [4][5][6]. The authors in [6] proposed
an AP selection method using Markov approximation. Markov
approximation is a recently developed decentralized optimiza-
tion framework [7]. In Markov approximation, an approximate
solution to the optimization problem can be obtained by de-
signing the system to follow a time-reversible continuous-time
Markov chain [8][9][10]. Speciﬁcally, the time spent in each
state in the Markov chain depends on the objective function
value, and the aim is to maximize the objective function value
in terms of the time-average. The system is designed so that
when the system state has the high objective function value,
the system stays in this state for a long time. In contrast, when
the system stays at the state with the low objective function
value, the system quickly transitions from these states. This
causes the system to remain in a state with a high objective
function values. It was shown in [6] that throughput fairness
can be achieved by using Markov approximation to minimize
user throughput as an objective function. However, this existing
method has the problem that the increases in the objective
function value are suppressed because the transitions to states
with low objective function values occur frequently.
In this paper, we propose a new AP and channel selection
method using Markov approximation based on RSSI values.
In our proposed method, each user changes their connections
to APs with a high RSSI compared with the current RSSI,
and does not change the connection to an AP with a low
RSSI value. This makes it possible to suppress the transition to
states where the objective function value is low, and to increase
the time average value. Through simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we explain the system model of this paper. Section III dis-
cusses our proposed method. In Section IV, the performance
of the proposed method is examined using the results of the
simulation experiments. Finally, we conclude the paper in
Section V.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a situation with multiple users and multiple
APs, as shown in Figure 1. Let K be the set of users and A
be the set of deployed APs, respectively. Further, let C be the
set of channels that can be used by each AP. In this case, each
AP a ∈ A selects one channel from |C| channels, and each
user k ∈ K selects one AP from the set A of APs.
The system state is represented by the combination of the
channels selected by each AP and the APs selected by each
user. Here, let the 1×|A| vector x and 1×|K| vector y denote
the channels selected by the APs and the APs selected by the
users, respectively, where the ith element xi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , |C|}
of x is the channel selected by AP i and the jth element yj ∈
{1, 2, . . . , |A|} of y is the AP selected by user j. The system
state is represented as (x, y), and the set Z(t) of feasible

system states at time t can be represented as follows:
Z(t)
=
{(x, y) | xi ∈ [1, |C|], yj ∈ [1, |A|]
i = 1, 2, . . . , |A|, j = 1, 2, . . . , |K|}. (1)
In the following, we call a feasible state z ∈ Z(t) a strategy.
When multiple users select the same AP, it is assumed that
frequency resources can be used evenly by time division multi-
plexing. Therefore, when strategy z is adopted, the throughput
uk(z) for each user k is deﬁned as
uk(z) = mk,a/Nc(z),
(2)
where mk,a is the throughput that can be achieved when only
user k is connected to AP a, and Nc(z) is the total number
of users connected to the same channel c ∈ C used as user k.
Note that this multiplexing assumption is simple, and thus we
will tackle to the more realistic situation.
In order to achieve the throughput fairness, we consider
the problem of maximizing the utility mink∈K uk(z), which is
the minimum throughput among all users in K. The problem
of maximizing the utility at time t can be formulated as
max
z∈Z(t){min
k∈K uk(z)}.

RSSI-BASED AP AND CHANNEL SELECTION METHOD
USING MARKOV APPROXIMATION
We ﬁrst explain about the Markov approximation, and then
describe the details of our proposed method.
A. Markov approximation
This section assumes a static situation where there is no
increase or decrease in the number of users. In such a static
situation with Φz = mink∈K uk(z) as an objective function, an
approximate solution can be obtained by solving the following
problem [7].

z∈Z(t)
pzΦz − 1

subject to
∑

pz = 1,
(5)
where pz is the time ratio at which the strategy z ∈ Z(t) is
adopted, and p(t) is a 1 × |Z(t)| vector (p1, p2, · · · , p|Z(t)|).
Furthermore, β is a parameter for controlling the accuracy of
the approximation, which improves as β increases. Because
this problem is a nonlinear programming problem, the optimal
solution p∗
z can be obtained by solving the following problem
based on the KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) condition.

∑
z∈Z(t)
p∗
z = 1,
(7)
η ≥ 0,
(8)
where η is a Lagrange multiplier.
The solution p∗
z (z ∈ Z(t)) to the above problem is given
by
p∗
z =
exp(βΦz)
∑
z′∈Z(t) exp(βΦz′).
(9)
Note that this solution p∗
z also represents the steady-state
probability of a time-reversible continuous-time Markov chain
on Z(t) [7]. Therefore, if the APs and the users follow the
Markov chain in which the steady-state probability is p∗
z, we
obtain an approximate solution to the original problem.
It is known that a continuous-time Markov chain is time-
reversible when the following local equilibrium equations for
all strategies z, z′ in Z(t) are satisﬁed:
p∗
zqz,z′ = p∗
z′qz′,z,
(10)
where qz,z′ is the transition rate from strategy z to strategy z′.
Substituting (1) into the above equation yields the following
equation:
exp(βΦz)qz,z′ = exp(βΦz′)qz′,z
(11)
To achieve a time-reversible Markov chain, the transition rate
qz,z′ is set to be qz,z′ = α(t)/ exp(βΦz), where α(t) is a
parameter that controls the transition rate. In [6], we evaluated
the performance in a static situation, and showed that an
accurate solution with high accuracy can be obtained by ﬁxing
α(t) to be an appropriate value.
B. Details of our proposed method
In our proposed method, each AP and each user select
a channel and an AP according to the Markov chain on
Z(t), respectively. Figure 2 presents a ﬂowchart of our pro-
posed method. Each AP a ∈ A chooses a random number
r according to the exponential distribution with parameter
λ(t) = α(t)(|C| − 1)/ exp (βΦz). On the other hand, each
user k ∈ K chooses a random number r according to the
exponential distribution of λ(t) = α(t)(|Ak| − 1)/ exp (βΦz),
where Ak represents the set of APs with the high RSSI values
for user k ∈ K. After choosing the random number r, all APs
and users start counting down.
When the count for either an AP or a user falls below 0,
the strategy is changed according to the following procedure.
If the count for AP a ∈ A is less than 0, then one channel
is randomly selected from the channels in C \ {c}, and AP a
switches to the selected channel. On the other hand, if the count
for a user k ∈ K is less than 0, then one AP a is randomly
selected from the set Ak of APs with the high RSSI values, and
then switches to AP a. When switching is completed, the APs
and users are notiﬁed of the new utility value. Speciﬁcally, if
the strategy is changed to znew by switching, then the utility is

ﬁgure, it can be seen that by not selecting the AP with the
lowest RSSI value (mk,a = 40), the objective function value
increases rapidly.
Figure 5 shows the time-average objective function value
¯Φ(t) as a function of the parameter β that controls the
approximation accuracy. Note that each point represents the
value ¯Φ(50, 000), i.e., the time-average value when 50,000
time units have passed. From Figure 5, the value of the
objective function value increases monotonically as the pa-
rameter β increases. This is because increasing parameter β
also increases the accuracy of the approximation increases, so
that the objective function value also increases. In addition,
the objective function value for the proposed method is larger
than that for the existing method for all β, and thus conﬁrming
the effectiveness of considering the RSSI value.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed an AP selection method
using Markov approximation by considering RSSI values. The
performance of the proposed method was compared with that
of the existing method using simulation experiments, and it
was shown that the rate of increase of the objective function
value could be improved. In this paper, we have considered a
static environment with a ﬁxed number of users. In reality,
AP selection occurs in a dynamic environment where the
number of users changes. Therefore, a topic for future research
is evaluating the performance of the proposed method in a
dynamic environment.
