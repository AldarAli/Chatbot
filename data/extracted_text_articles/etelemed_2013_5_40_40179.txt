Abstract— The authors have been conducting successive 
estimations on the effect of e-Health on medical expenditures and 
outpatient treatment days for chronic diseases using survey data 
from Nishi-aizu Town, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The reason 
why this town was chosen is that it has been implementing e-
Health more than 15 years and is one of the most successful 
examples. This paper uses several other outcome variables such 
as medical expenditures and treatment days of outpatient and 
inpatient, and compares those outcomes among two groups such 
as 199 treatment (users) of e-Health and 209 control (non-users) 
selected from residents. In this paper, the propensity score 
matching (PSM) method, a rigorous analytical method is used to 
overcome sample selection bias which is contained in data in the 
process which samples were selected. PSM is a method to choose 
subjects from two groups with exact similar characteristics 
except for their use or non-use of e-Health. After eliminating 
biases, the effect of e-Health on medical expenditures and 
treatment days was estimated. To obtain robust results, two 
different matching methods were applied, that is, caliper 
matching, and Epanechnikov kernel matching. The results 
demonstrated that the treatment group has lower medical 
expenditures for chronic diseases than the control group. Using 
other outcomes enables international comparison of e-Health 
projects with the same standard. Such comparisons are also 
presented.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The most common method of evaluating the effectiveness 
of a new drug or clinical intervention is the Randomized 
Control Trial (RCT), in which subjects are randomly selected 
and categorized into a treatment and a control group, and the 
effect is compared between two groups. The most serious 
problem of RCTs is avoiding bias between the two groups, 
which is referred to as sample selection bias. Samples are 
required to be selected randomly without bias and must be as 
similar as possible between the two groups to obtain an 
unbiased evaluation. Such unbiased sampling is not always 
achieved, since there are actually many ways in which the 
material diverges with regard to users and sample subjects. A 
suitable method of matching the two groups to obviate such 
bias is therefore required. Traditional ways of coping with this 
problem include the matched sampling method or matched-
pairs analysis. This method selects subjects in the control 
group to ensure similar criteria, such as age, sex, or health 
status, to subjects in the treatment group. In the field of 
telemedicine, matched each of their treatment subjects with 
four control subjects having similar demographics and 
morbidity status ([1] for example). Ambiguity with this 
method remains, however: what multiple of each treatment 
subject is sufficient to eliminate bias, and by what degree is 
bias is actually reduced? Moreover, sampling becomes more 
difficult with an increase in the criteria; and if the number of 
criteria must remain small, selection bias will remain. 
A more rigorous method of overcoming selection bias is the 
propensity score matching (PSM) method, which enables the 
inclusion of as many criteria as necessary. A propensity score 
related to biased characteristics is first calculated for each 
individual, and then outcome variables, such as medical 
expenditures, are compared for individuals whose scores are 
close. One treatment subject is matched to one control subject 
who has similar characteristics, reducing sample selection bias. 
Moreover, the actual decrease in bias after matching can be 
calculated. 
PSM use in medical research has been long and varied. 
Among studies of clinical interventions, for example, [2] 
examined the association of ambulatory visits to cardiologists, 
internists, and family practitioners after discharge for 
myocardial infarction and mortality. Using PSM to adjust for 
the demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics of 
patients, they successfully ranked treatments among matched 
patients in terms of a reduction in morality. [3] analyzed 
whether aspirin is associated with a mortality benefit in 
patients with coronary disease. While simple univariate 
analysis found no association between aspirin use and 
mortality, adjustment by PSM for age, sex, and other 
characteristics, including risk factors, other medications, and 
coronary disease did identify a decrease in mortality with 
aspirin. In drug evaluation, [4] compared conventional and 
atypical antipsychotic medication for mortality among elderly 
patients, and used propensity-score adjustments to conclude 
that the former increased the risk of death. 
Our previous paper ([5]) used the PSM method to estimate 
the effect of e-Health on outpatient medical expenditures and 
days for treatment and demonstrated that for chronic diseases, 
e-Health successfully improves these outcomes of its users in 
comparison with non-users. [5] examined, however, above 
two outcome variables related to all and chronic diseases, and 
there are other outcomes we have to compare. The aim of this 
paper is to expand the previous analysis in such a way that 
patients are categorized in more detail, that is, we compare 
medical expenditures and treatment days of inpatient and

outpatient, and so on. Accordingly, this paper can highlight 
clearly the robustness of the results of our successive 
estimations, that is, telecare or e-Health has effects on chronic 
diseases, not necessarily all diseases. 
Although treatment-effects studies have been widely used 
in medicine, only a few studies have examined the effects of 
telemedicine using PSM. One example is the study of Care 
Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT) conducted by the 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) by [6], albeit that their 
analytical methods of PSM and estimation were less rigorous 
than those of the present study, with outcome variables 
restricted to hospital admission and days of hospitalization. To 
our knowledge, no other study has evaluated the effect of e-
Health on medical expenditures using PSM.  
II. EHEALTH SYSTEM OF NISHI-AIZU TOWN 
A. 
About Town 
Nishi-aizu Town is located in the Northwest corner of 
Fukushima Prefecture, and is been an important point of 
transit to reach Niigata Prefecture and Aizu-wakamatsu, a 
nearby major city. The center of town is in a basin but the 
main area is surrounded by mountains, which cover 86% of 
the prefecture’s area. The climate is severe in winter and 
summer, with lots of snow. The population is about 8,000; 
there are 3,000 households, and the percentage of the elderly 
(≥ 65 years) was 41.0% in 2010. The main industry is 
agriculture, and rice is the main product. 
B. 
Health and Medical Situation 
As stated earlier, severe winter, especially heavy snow 
causes elderly people to lack physical exercise. In addition, 
due to a traditional diet of salty and protein-poor food, the 
town’s death rate was 1.7 times higher than the national 
average during 1983-87, partly due to high rates of stomach 
cancer. The number of bedridden elderly people suffering 
from osteoporosis or arthritis is higher than the national 
average. In order to cope with these situations, the town office 
took initiative to establish a “total care system,” which is 
referred to as the “Challenge to 100 Years Old,” by unifying 
health, medical and welfare services. As a part of this project, 
e-Health was introduced in 1993. 
In the town, there are three public clinics, named Nishi-aizu, 
Murooka and Shingo, which are operated by the National 
Insurance System, and two private clinics. The total number 
of medical doctors is four. One full-time physician is 
employed in the Murooka clinic, while the Shingo clinic has a 
part-time doctor dispatched from the other two clinics. There 
are private doctors, a surgeon and a neurologist, but both are 
more than 70 years old. 
C. Introduction of e-Health  
In order to prevent chronic diseases such as cerebral 
infarction and stroke, the town office introduced e-Health in 
1994 which is Japan's longest-running e-Health. 300 
peripheral devices called “Urara,” manufactured by Nasa 
Corporation, were provided to residents who have symptoms 
of the above diseases. Each terminal is connected a host 
computer via PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), 
and health-related data of users, such as blood pressure, pulse, 
ECG, blood oxygen, weight and temperature are transmitted 
to a host computer. In 1996 and 1997, an additional 50 
terminals each were purchased. These terminals use the 
CATV network for transmitting data. All costs of operating 
the system are paid by the town. In 2010, new peripheral 
device called “Kouri,” was introduced in accordance with the 
network renovation of CATV for optical fiber. Currently all 
network were transformed to optical fiber. 
D. 
Operation of the e-Health System 
The section in charge of e-Health is the town office’s 
Department of Health and Welfare, which consists of seven 
public health nurses which represents a much larger ratio than 
in other towns. They check the above health data transmitted 
by users and if these nurses observe unusual data, they ask 
medical doctors in clinics to see the patient in question. The 
health data of each user are summarized in a “Monthly 
Report,” which is sent to a physician in charge. After a public 
health nurse adds their comments, the report is sent to the user. 
When the user sees a doctor, he/she is asked to bring the 
report with him/her. 
e-Health is being operated as a part of the town’s “Project 
for Promoting Total Care,” and its essence lies in the close 
collaboration of health, medical and welfare activities. One 
important example of this collaboration are “Regional Care 
Meetings,” which consist of doctors, nurses, public health 
nurses, staff of the town office, helpers of elderly people, and 
living advisers. The total number of participants in each 
meeting is over 20. Problems and treatments regarding a 
particular user, such as medical examinations, health advice, 
and care are discussed in detail. The health data of e-Health 
plays a role in this meeting. In Nishi-aizu Town, many such 
examples of exchanging information on residents can be 
found in the town office.  
In addition, the town office organizes users’ meetings five 
times a year in order to enhance motivation to use e-Health, 
and users exchange their experiences with using the system. 
These activities promote usage of the system. The 
introduction of e-Health is not the sole factor promoting 
regional healthcare; rather, it should establish a framework for 
the system to assist all related sections and personnel.  
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
A. Selection of sample and data characteristics  
The data used in this paper were reported in our previous 
study ([8]). From a total of 523 users and 3,528 non-users in 
Nishi-aizu Town, 199 and 209 individuals were selected for 
each group through a questionnaire survey which asked about 
individual characteristics and use of e-Health. Healthcare 
receipts for five years (2002 to 2006) were obtained from the 
National Health Insurance system and checked. The small 
number of users meant that the sampling was necessarily 
biased, as detailed in Table I, which expresses biases by the 
difference between the averages of the two groups, and uses t-
values to indicate the degree of bias for individual variables. 
Significant biases were identified in “chronic diseases,” “age,” 
“number of family” “income,” “heart disease,” “high blood 
pressure,” “strokes”, “ophthalmic diseases,” “anal diseases”,

and in subjective belief in the value of e-Health on health 
status, termed “Effects 1-4.”  
The number of positive replies to the questionnaire item 
asking whether the subject had chronic diseases or not was 
substantially higher for the user than the non-user group. 
Substantial corresponding bias was also seen with regard to 
the presence of heart disease, high blood pressure, and strokes, 
and with regard to the number of users treated for these 
conditions during the sample period. A question on subjective 
belief in the value of e-Health on health status with respect to 
four effects showed that users tended to have higher health 
consciousness than non-users, which is consistent with 
anecdotal impressions expressed by the town’s public nurses 
who manage the system. 
B. Propensity Score Matching 
PSM was initially proposed by [9], [10] [11] and developed 
by [12]. The procedure is as follows: 
 (1) First, subjects in the user (treatment) and non-user 
(control) groups are individually matched with one another so 
that their propensity scores as calculated according to their 
attributes become closer. The score is calculated by a probit  
analysis, which is interpreted as the predicted probability of a 
probit estimation. The model consists of the user dummy as a 
dependent variable, while independent variables are those that 
have a sample selection bias, as shown in Table I.

(2) Second, subjects in the treatment and control groups are 
matched based on propensity score. There are several ways of 
matching - caliper matching is generally considered better 
than others, such as nearest neighbor matching, since it can 
exclude ‘bad’ matches ([7]). This paper utilizes caliper 
matching, in which a value for the maximum distance of 
predefined propensity scores is fixed at 0.0001, which the 
PSM literature describes as sufficiently small. The suitability 
of the matching can be examined by a balancing test, in which 
the explanatory variables listed above in the treatment and 
control groups are compared by a t-test - when a treatment 
does not meet its best-matched control, re-sampling by the 
bootstrapping method with 1000 replications is conducted. If 
there is no statistically significant difference, the matching is 
concluded. 
(3) Finally, the effect of e-Health on outcome variables, which 
in this paper are medical expenditures and number of days 
required for treatment, is examined based on matched samples 
by a t-test (standard error estimation). 
IV. 
RESULTS  
Summary statistics for outcome variables, namely medical 
expenditures and days for treatment, are summarized in Table 
II. 
A. Bias control  
PSM thus calculates a propensity score by a probit model in 
which the dependent variable is the user dummy variable, 
while independent variables are selected based on whether 
they contain a selection bias. Whether matching based on the 
propensity score works is examined by a balancing test is 
shown in Table III. The column named “% of bias” indicates 
the percentages of bias contained before and after matching 
for each variable. For example, “age” has 28.3% bias before 
matching, which is reduced to 4.4% after matching. Similarly, 
the column “% of reduced bias” shows the percentage of bias 
actually reduced by PSM, or 81.9% for age. The reduction in

sample selection bias is thus successful, since no statistically 
significant variable remains after matching in terms of t-
values. In particular, biases related to subjective belief in the 
value of e-Health on health status shown by “Effects 1-4” are 
also substantially reduced. 
B. Effect of e-Health on medical expenditures and days of 
treatment for outpatient and inpatient. 
This paper uses two outcomes such as medical expenditures 
and days of treatment, but categorizes patients in different 
ways, namely, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient + inpatient. 
As a result, 10 cases are analyzed, which are listed in Table IV. 
Our previous paper [5] examined only two cases; (7) and (8), 
which are related to chronic diseases, the main targets for 
Nishi-aizu’s e-Health system. Cases (1)-(6) are related to all 
diseases for comparison with chronic diseases. 
In Table IV, the rows named “before” and “after” indicate 
estimations before and after matching. Two methods of PSM 
matching are examined, Epanechnikov kernel matching and 
caliper (0.0001) matching. Table IV shows that both 
outpatient medical expenditures (7) and outpatient days of 
treatment (8) for chronic diseases did not significantly differ 
between users and non-users of telecare before matching, 
whereas after matching two matching methods showed a 
significantly negative difference (p<0.05), implying that e-
Health has an effect on outpatients medical expenditures and 
days of treatment for chronic diseases. The column 
“difference” indicates the decrease in the amount of 
expenditure and number of treatment days. Caliper matching 
provided the greatest effect, namely JPY 39,936 (US$ 499.20) 
and 3.97 days per year per user, while Epanechnikov kernel 
matching produced the smallest, at JPY 25,538 (US$319.23) 
and 2.60 days.  
The above results are already presented in [5], but this 
analysis shows new results regarding (3), (4) and (6), that is, 
users have significantly smaller inpatient medical expenditure 
(3), treatment days (outpatient + inpatient) (4), and inpatient 
treatment days (6) than those of non-users (p<0.05). The 
amounts of difference are JPY 51,801 (3), 7.67 days (4), and 
3.31 days (6), respectively. It should be noted that these 
results hold only in terms of Epanechnikov kernel matching, 
and then these do not satisfy robustness. As for the other cases 
such as (1), (2), (5), (9), and (10), this analysis does not 
provide any significant results, and further examination is 
necessary.  
The estimation in this paper shows that even if other 
outcomes are taken as dependent variables, telecare of this 
town has effect on the reduction of outpatient medical 
expenditures and days of treatment of chronic diseases. 
IV. DISCUSSION  
Cases (7) and (8) in Table IV thus demonstrates that e-
Health does not contribute to a reduction in medical 
expenditures for all diseases, but only for chronic diseases ([5] 
[13] [14] and [15] have the same result), since users’ 
expenditures for chronic diseases are larger than those of non-
users before matching, but significantly smaller after matching.  
The estimation results related to cases (4) and (6) for days 
of treatment, which are statistically significant with 
Epanechnikov kernel matching, can be used for some 
interesting international comparisons. Regarding the research 
results with the Kent Development Pilot in the UK and the 
CCHT project of the VHA in the US, the former studied the 
effect of telehealth on the number of inpatient days, general 
practices (GP), acute care, and others by experimental 
observation with statistical analysis ([15]). This study 
compared outcomes at baseline and six month with a focus on 
patients with COPD, heart disease, and diabetes. The authors 
concluded that telecare use resulted in a decrease in the 
number of home visits and GP surgery per participant, 
Accident and Emergency (A&E) visit of 0.5days, and 
inpatient treatment days of 1.5days. The latter reported in the 
same manner as the Kent study, that is, the number of 
inpatient treatment days was reduced by 25%, and the number 
of hospital admission by 19% ([16]). Thus other results of 
international projects were estimated mainly in terms of 
inpatient treatment days, not expenditures, and all diseases, 
not only chronic diseases. This paper is aimed to obtain the 
results which can compare in the same manner. According to 
our results, the Nishi-aizu project has larger reduction of 
inpatient treatment days than the Kent project (3.3 vs. 1.5 
days). On the other hand, the reduction of bed days of this 
paper is calculated as approximately 16.12%, which is smaller 
than that of the VHA project (25%).  
Table V also compares the effects obtained by the other 
estimation methods, such as simple OLS ([13]) and system 
GMM ([8]), used in our previous papers. The effects of e-
Health are underestimated when sample selection biases are 
not controlled.

Although PSM offers major benefits in the evaluation of e-
Health projects, it has its own limitations. First, it requires a 
large number of samples, and several previous studies have in 
fact used samples in the several tens of thousands range. 
Second, its results are not always robust, which is why our 
present paper examines two matching methods. These 
limitations have been described (see [9] and [12] for example), 
but one limitation specific to e-Health has not. In this paper, 
PSM successfully demonstrated that the user group had less 
medical expenditures than the non-user group under the 
condition that all subjects were closely similar except in their 
use of e-Health. Our previous study [13] [14] and [17] 
concluded that these results were due to the difference in

health consciousness between the groups. By checking heath 
data transmitted by the e-Health system and receive health 
consultation from town’s public nurses, users became more 
concerned with health and had an incentive to change their 
behavior to be more health-conscious. These findings are not 
consistent with those of the present analysis, however, which 
found different expenditures despite a closely similar degree 
of health consciousness, which could only be due to e-Health 
use. PSM thus provides little explanation of why and how e-
Health leads to these results, and identification of these 
mechanisms requires the use of other empirical methods 
together with PSM. 
V. CONCLUSION  
By using PSM, this paper successfully controls biases due 
to the way to collect the sample (sample selection bias) and 
provides a rigorous demonstration of the effect of an e-Health 
implementation in a small Japanese town in reducing the 
number of treatment days as well as medical expenditures. 
Moreover, this paper uses some other outcomes as dependent 
variables and their estimation results enable to compare with 
the outcomes of e-Health projects in the UK and US which 
have the similar peripheral device and system. According to 
our in-depth surveys of these projects, there are similarities 
and differences in these projects, but a common success factor 
lies in the enthusiasm of nurses, public or visiting nurses who 
participate in these projects to maintain health of the residents 
in the community. Further detailed study is required for 
factors of differences. 
Let us discuss on the economic foundation of the project. 
Nishi-aizu Town does not charge any fee to users. Other 
projects in the most of counties are the same. Neither this 
program nor those referenced in the UK and US charge user 
fees; rather, all are subsidized by the central as well as local 
government, as indeed are the UK demonstration programs, 
since they are national pilot projects. However, the ongoing 
sustainability of e-Health requires a new financial framework. 
[17] conducted a cost/benefit analysis of Nishi-aizu’s e-Health 
and calculated a B/C (cost-benefit) ratio which was 0.25. The 
initial costs of the implementation, such as for host computers 
and peripheral devices, were borne by the central government, 
however, excluding them form analysis gave a B/C ratio for 
Town which bore only operational costs, which is 0.91. But 
this is not sustainable. One possibility for promoting e-Health 
is reimbursement using public medical insurance. The amount 
of reimbursement is based on economic effect of e-Health and 
must be obtained rigorous analysis. Most of countries are not 
recognized reimbursement for e-Health, which reason is 
simple; e-Health is not diagnosis but prevention of diseases. 
The simple e-Health system does reduce medical expenditures 
of users. The present paper provides important support for the 
development of evidence-based policies for the diffusion of e-
Health.
