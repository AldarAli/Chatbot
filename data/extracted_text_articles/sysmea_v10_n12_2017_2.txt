Abstract— The progressive growth of aging, increased life 
expectancy and a greater number of chronic diseases contribute 
significantly to the growing demand of emergency medical care, 
and thus, on saturation of Emergency Departments. This is one 
of the most important current problems in healthcare systems 
worldwide. This work proposes an analytical model to calculate 
the theoretical throughput of a particular sanitary staff 
configuration in a Hospital Emergency Department, which is, 
the number of patients it can attend per unit time given its 
composition. The analytical model validation is based on data 
generated by simulation of the real system, based on an agent 
based model of the system, which makes it possible to take into 
account different valid sanitary staff configurations and 
different number of patients entering the emergency service. In 
fact, we aim to evaluate the response capacity of an ED, 
specifically of doctors, nurses, admission and triage personnel, 
who make up a specific sanitary staff configuration, for any 
possible configuration, according to the patient flow throughout 
the service. It would not be possible to test the different possible 
situations in the real system and this is the main reason why we 
obtain the necessary information about the system performance 
for the validation of the model using a simulator as a sensor of 
the real system. The theoretical throughput is a measure of the 
response capacity to patient’s attention in the system and, 
moreover, it will be a reference in order to make possible a 
model for planning the entry of non-critical patients into the 
service by its relocation in the current input pattern, which is 
an immediate future goal in our current research. This research 
offers the availability of relevant knowledge to the managers of 
the Emergency Departments to make decisions to improve the 
quality of the service in anticipation of the expected growing 
demand of the service in the very near future.

INTRODUCTION 
The current research focuses on the field of modeling and 
simulation of a Hospital Emergency Department (ED) and, 
specifically, on the use of simulation as a source of data for 
the extraction of information. This information, finally, must 
provide us with an extensive knowledge of the behavior of 
the system in any situation. 
We proceed with the main objective of providing a 
methodology that allows the managers of an ED to be able to 
make decisions to improve the quality of the service 
provided to patients who use the service. 
With this objective in mind, in a previous paper, we 
explained the idea of characterizing the system through an 
analytical model based on the definition of a set of indexes, 
indicators of its attention capacity and its performance, given 
different possible scenarios [1]. The given model in [1] 
presents some limitations, since it does not take into account 
all possible combinations of the healthcare staff, as it's 
already 
mentioned 
in 
the 
referenced 
article. 
The 
generalization of this model is presented here. 
Currently, given the growing demand for emergency 
medical care, mostly due to the progressive growth of aging, 
increased life expectancy and greater number of chronic 
diseases, the management of EDs is increasingly important. 
Particularly, how to manage the increasing number of 
patients entering into the service is one of the most important 
problems in EDs worldwide, because it requires a substantial 
amount 
of 
human 
and 
material 
resources, 
which 
unfortunately are often too limited, as well as a high degree 
of coordination between them [2][3]. A major consequence 
of the increase in patients entering the service is its saturation 
[4]. This results in an increase in the total time a patient 
spends in the service, from their entry to their discharge, 
called Length of Stay of patients in the service (LoS). This 
can produce a general discontent among patients for reasons 
such as being abandoned without receiving care, limited 
access to emergency care and an increasing patient mortality 
[5]. 
Some studies in the related literature try to analyze the 
factors that influence patients’ long periods of stay of in the 
ED and its saturation [6] [7]. Others show that saturation and 
long waits increase the proportion of patients who leave the 
service without being seen by a doctor (LWBS) [8] [9]. The 
aim of some others is to reduce the LoS, and therefore, the 
total time the patient is waiting to be attended, or length of

waiting for patients (LoW), and some of the solutions that 
have been found and have been implemented are called Fast 
Tracks [10] [11], or other measures known as See and Treat 
[12]. Finally, we highlight those references using simulation 
to test the effectiveness of the proposed measures for 
improvement in the LoS of patients in the ED [13] - [17]. 
The ED service is one of the most complex areas of the 
hospital due to its dynamism and variability over time. The 
operation of the system is the result of the interaction 
between the different elements of which it is composed, and 
all this makes it a complex real system. 
Modeling and simulation of complex real systems, such 
as an ED, is one of the most powerful tools available for 
their description. Simulation provides a better understanding 
of their operation and of the activity of their elements, and it 
can help decision-making to establish strategies for an 
optimal system operation [18][19].  
The final objective of modeling and simulation of a real 
system is to find additional knowledge about it. This can be 
achieved by inference processes on the variables of interest 
of the system in order to make predictions about the behavior 
of these variables under different conditions, based on 
information obtained from the generated data [20]. 
As a result of an intensive previous research, we have an 
ED simulator available, based on an Agent-Based Modeling 
(ABM) design of the system, which has been developed, 
verified and validated within our research group, the “High 
Performance Computing for Efficient Applications and 
Simulation” Research Group (HPC4EAS) of the Universitat 
Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), in collaboration with the 
ED Staff Team of the Short Stay Unit of Hospital de 
Sabadell (one of the most important hospitals in Spain, 
which provides care service to a catchment area of 500,000 
people, and attends 160,000 patients per year in the ED). The 
model describes the ED's behavior from the actions and 
interactions between agents, and between them and their 
physical environment. The input parameters that characterize 
each different scenario in the simulation of the real system 
are the healthcare staff configuration, the number and type of 
incoming patients each hour, and the period of time 
simulated. As output, given that the most widely used and 
accepted parameter in the literature as an indicator of the 
quality of service is the total LoS of patients in the service, 
each simulation provides data of this index of all patients in 
all locations in the ED. In addition, the simulator includes 
sensors  to obtain fully temporalized information about the 
agents, in such a way that data on the number of patients per 
hour and location are also available for each iteration. The 
implementation of the simulator has been done with 
NetLogo, an agent-based simulation environment well-suited 
for modeling complex systems [21][22].  
An initial application of the simulator, with interesting 
results, was carried out by analyzing the effects of different 
derivation policies over the ED performance, particularly by 
analyzing how these changes modify the LoS of patients in 
the service [23]. 
Another study in the same research line consisted of 
trying to find the optimal healthcare staff configuration to 
minimize the LoS of the patients in the service, taking into 
account a constraint related to the cost of the configurations 
and the amount of available resources [24]. 
There are a great number and variety of simulated agents, 
and different possible values for the input parameters in the 
simulator. This results in a large number of different possible 
scenarios to be simulated. Thus, the use of High Performance 
Computing (HPC) was necessary in both experiments, due to 
the high number of executions required and the amount of 
data to be computed. 
The main purpose of these previous researches was to 
provide some understanding of specific variables affecting 
the normal system performance. This could support decision-
making (DSS), aiding the administrators and heads of the ED 
to choose the policies that could permit them to achieve a 
better quality of service with the available human and 
technical resources. 
Our current work tries to obtain further and different 
knowledge concerning the performance of the system. We 
propose a model for system characterization with respect to 
the sanitary staff available configuration in it. It is an 
analytical model based on a set of equations that allow us to 
obtain the necessary information to obtain knowledge 
regarding the theoretical capacity to patient care of the 
system with respect to its staff resources, given a specific 
staff configuration and according with the patient flow in the 
system. 
The content of the paper is organized as follows: Section 
II presents the research objectives and methodology of the 
research; Section III briefly describes the ED process and the 
simulation model; Section IV presents the analytical model 
proposed; and the experimental results for model validation 
are showed in Section V. Finally, Section VI closes the paper 
with discussion and future work.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY 
It is a fact that saturation of the ED service is mostly due 
to admission of patients with lower acuity level. Based on 
historical real data from the Hospital de Sabadell, these 
patients represent a high percentage of the admitted patients 
and most of them are non-critical (see Figure 4 in Section 
III.B). We hypothesized that a redistribution of these non-
critical patients in the input pattern initially planned by 
historical data (Figure 1), can lead to an improvement in 
waiting times for all patients, and therefore, to an 
improvement in the quality of service from the point of view 
of the users of the service, as it could avoid long waiting 
times in the service.

Figure 1.  Input pattern of patients per hour and day of the week 
(historical data of 2014 of the Hospital de Sabadell). 
In fact, the real starting point of this research was to 
understand the simulator as our main source of data. These 
data are the raw material for the analysis and they become 
information when we assign them some special meaning. 
When a model is found or designed, in order to interpret this 
information, and the model represents an added value, we 
refer to it as knowledge.  
Moreover, simulation allows us to obtain data from 
situations, which cannot be proved in the real system, 
therefore any experimental limitation in the real system can 
be overcome through computer simulation. This idea 
suggested to us the hypothesis of the ability to gain 
knowledge about the ED service behavior from the data 
provided by the simulation of any possible reality. 
From the analysis of the data from simulation, we can 
obtain information concerning patient's LoS in the service. 
The research we are conducting aims to improve the quality 
of service provided in a ED, trying to reduce the LoS of 
patients, through a model for scheduling the entry of non-
critical patients into the service. The model will be based on 
the prediction of the LoS of patients in the ED by simulation. 
Simulation would also be the way to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the scheduling model for patient admission, 
in which we are currently working on. 
Specifically, the goal of the work presented in this paper 
is the first step on the way to the definition of this scheduling 
model. It consists of developing an analytical model to 
determine the theoretical throughput (T_ThP) of a particular 
healthcare staff configuration, which we define as the 
number of patients it can take care per unit time given its 
composition. It is a reference to measure the performance of 
the system and the capacity of the healthcare staff 
configuration to absorb the demand for the service, so it is an 
indicator of the response capacity of the system to patient 
attention. 
It should be clarified that we propose a simplified model 
for the calculation of the system capacity, considering the 
system in a steady state. It is a continuous flow model, with 
regular admission and no queues. With this, we want to 
obtain, analytically, a reference value of the productivity of 
the system for its characterization in an ideal situation. This 
reference value will allow us to evaluate the effects on the 
behavior of the system against different measures through 
simulation. Specific changes in the input parameters of the 
simulator, in particular, referring to the patient input and the 
configuration of the sanitary staff, simulating different 
possible real situations, will modify the actual productivity 
of the system. The theoretical value obtained through the 
analytical model will be a reference to guide these changes.  
The corresponding value for the T_ThP is an appropriate 
indicator for system characterization and it will indicate 
whether the considered healthcare staff configuration will 
generate endless queues for a specific scenario, or in another 
way, the number of patients attending the service is below its 
response capacity, and so the occupancy of the staff is not at 
its limit. 
In the experimental results for the validation of the model 
in Section V, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the effect 
of an increase or a decrease in the number of patients 
entering the service every hour, with respect to the 
theoretical value obtained as reference for the T_ThP. This 
analysis shows how the number of patients waiting to be 
attended in each phase of the process, which we call Waiting 
Queue Length (WQL), reaches endless values when the input 
for patients reaches and surpasses the obtained T_ThP with 
the model. It is also observed how the percentage of time in 
which the corresponding healthcare staff is attending or 
treating patients for each phase (occupancy) reaches 100% 
when this happens. 
Once the system is characterized by this value, we can 
take it into account to act in order to avoid long waiting 
times through the admission scheduling of non-critical 
patients, and ultimately improve the LoS of all patients in the 
service. 
The final aim of the complete research will be to obtain 
an input distribution of patients, which is as homogeneous as 
possible, so that the flow of patients in the service shall be in 
accordance with the response capacity of the system 
according to the healthcare staff resources at any time. 
Moreover, the simulator will again be the main source of 
data for the model validation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT 
OPERATION PROCESS 
We divide this section into three subsections in which we 
describe the basic operation of the ED, the different types of 
patient and the functionality of the ED simulator. 
A. Emergency Department Process 
The operation of the ED is based on a process consisting 
of different steps or phases in which each patient is passing 
from their entry into the service until they are discharged, 
referred to another service or admitted to the hospital (Figure 
2). 
The ED is divided into different areas, which correspond 
with the different process phases: 
• 
Admissions Area: Administrative staff carries out the 
registration of the patient's arrival and the reasons for 
their visit to the emergency service. 
• 
Triage Area: Professional sanitary staff identifies the 
priority level with which the patient should be 
treated.

Diagnosis-Treatment 
Zone: 
Healthcare 
staff 
(doctors, nurses and specialist technicians) try to 
identify the causes of the patient's health problem 
and, as far as possible, try to solve it. This area is in 
turn divided into different areas (medical room, 
nursing room, care boxes and X-ray laboratories). 
• 
Waiting Rooms: Distributed in different zones of the 
ED, where patients wait to be treated at the different 
stages of the process. 
B. Classification of patients 
Real data from Hospital de Sabadell corroborate that the 
majority of patients attending the service are not critical 
patients and, therefore, they do not require immediate 
valuation or can be outpatients (Figure 3). If these non-
critical patients had the possibility of getting information 
about when it is more advisable to go to the service, 
depending on the waiting time estimated for them, they 
would probably do it when the prevision for waits were 
lower. These are the patients suitable for a possible 
relocation in the current pattern of patients entering the 
service. 
In the triage phase, patients are classified according to 
their acuity level and they are assigned a priority. The scale 
of priority and urgency to be applied in Spanish hospitals 
(Spanish Triage System) is based on the Andorran Triage 
Model (MAT) [25] (Figure 4).

C. Functionality of the Simulator 
From the moment when the patient enters the service, the 
simulation runs according to the patient flow shown in 
Figure 5. The admission and triage phases are common to all 
patients entering the service, and there is a percentage, 
although low, of patients being referred to other services 
after the triage stage and also others who leave the service 
without being seen. After triage, patients with acuity level 1, 
2 and 3 are treated separately from those with acuity level 4 
and 5 for the diagnostic and treatment phase. In the 
simulation model, patients 1, 2 and 3 are treated in a specific 
area called Area A for diagnosis and treatment, and patients 
4 and 5 are treated in a separate area identified as Area B. 
The admissions and triage phase share the same healthcare 
staff, but doctors and assistant nurses are different for Area 
A and B. 
For our work, we are interested in tracking patients 4 and 
5, those who are non-critical patients, and can be relocated in 
time for their arrival to service. So, we will consider all 
patients for admissions and triage phases, but only patients 4 
and 5 (Area B) for diagnosis and treatment. 
In the diagnostic and treatment phase, all patients 
generated by the system go through an initial medical 
exploration phase, which we will identify hereafter as IE. A 
percentage of them are directly discharged and leave the ED 
after the IE phase (showed by a continuous line in Figure 5). 
The rest remain in the ED and they go through a phase of 
complementary examinations and/or treatment carried out by 
technical staff and/or nurses. After this, they return to see the 
doctor, who analyzes the test and/or treatment results (we 
will use AR onwards to refer to this phase). Finally, they are 
discharged from the service (showed by a dashed line in 
Figure 5).

Figure 5.  Patient flow in the Emergency Department. 
 
Figure 6.  Sanitary staff working in parallel on each phase. 
The simulator includes the following agents: patients, 
admissions staff, triage nurses, assistant nurses, doctors and 
radiology technicians. In the case of agents representing 
healthcare staff (all except patients), we consider two levels 
of experience (Junior/Senior) and all of them can work in 
parallel in each phase (Figure 6). The level of experience has 
an effect on the amount of time required for patient attention, 
which is different depending on their condition of junior or 
senior staff (hereafter SS and JS). 
The actions and interactions between the involved agents 
at each process step result in changes of state of the agents, 
which ultimately result in the global operation of the system. 
Each scenario of simulation is identified by an input 
healthcare staff configuration and a specific input of patients 
into the service, and the output of the simulation brings data 
concerning the number of attended patients, attention time 
and waiting time for each patient in all phases in their way 
through the service. 
IV. 
ANALYTICAL MODEL 
The quality of service, from the point of view of the user, 
is reflected in the time spent on patient attention and waiting 
times between different phases of the process. Moreover, 
from the point of view of service management, performance 
is directly related to the number of patients treated per unit 
time and an efficient use of resources.  
We propose a model for system characterization, which 
should give us information and knowledge in order to make 
possible changes in the system to improve it. The model is 
based on the definition of a set of indicators of the quality of 
service, and a set of equations that allow us to measure some 
intrinsic characteristics of the system given a specific 
healthcare staff configuration, and the patient flow presented 
in Figure 5. 
These equations will allow us to have information, and so 
knowledge, about the system capacity regarding its 
resources. We aim to use this knowledge to find an algorithm 
for the relocation of non-critical patients, modifying their 
current arrival pattern, such that their arrival at the service 
should be in accordance with the calculated system capacity. 
A. Definition of indexes 
As an indicator of the quality of service from the point of 
view of the user, we define an index called Patient attention 
Time (PaT) as the total time a patient is receiving attention 
throughout all stages in the service for a given configuration. 
This index is calculated from the summation of the values for 
the attention time in each stage, which are obtained from the 
simulator calibration, based on the corresponding values 
provided by the hospital:  
 
𝑃𝑎𝑇 =
,&'()% 𝑃𝑎𝑇%&'() + 
+-.
 
(1) 
PaTstage i indicates the Patient Attention Time in stage i, and it 
is independent of the number of patients entering the service. 
Notice that PaT is not a fixed value for all patients, as it 
depends on the followed way by each patient (not all patients 
are required for additional examinations or receive some 
treatment). 
Another parameter widely used and accepted in the 
literature as an indicator of the quality of service is the 
Length of Stay (LoS). It is defined as the total time a patient 
spends in the service. Unlike the previous one, the value of 
this index depends not only on the healthcare staff 
configuration, but also on the number and type of patients 
admitted to the service, as it includes the waiting time. 
Finally, the Length of Waiting (LoW) is the total waiting 
time of a patient throughout the service. Note that, 
 
LoS – PaT = LoW  and always   PaT ≤ LoS. 
(2) 
Moreover, the Equivalent Patient attention Time for 
stage i (EpaTstage i) is defined as the attention time of a patient 
taking into account the possibility of working in parallel for 
the agents in that stage, and (3) shows how it is calculated: 
 
𝐸𝑃𝑎𝑇%&'() + =
.
00 1
234 00
 1  5 
601
234 60

(3) 
where SSi and JSi in (3) and (5) stand for the total number of 
senior/junior health workers in the stage i respectively, and 
the calculation is the corresponding one for parallelization on 
a pipeline model. 
The slowest stage of the configuration will fix the speed 
at which patients can be attended in the service and also is 
the one which can saturate the system. It is, therefore, the 
inverse of the equivalent attention time of the slowest stage, 
which will determine the number of patients that a given 
configuration can treat per unit of time given its composition. 
We call this index Theoretical Throughput (T_ThP), which is 
the indicator we will use to measure the patient attention 
capacity of the configuration, that is, its response capacity 
for a specific situation. Expression (4) gives its calculation: 
 
𝑇_𝑇ℎ𝑃 =

In fact, the Theoretical Throughput for a specify stage i 
will be obtained by the inverse of (3): 
 
𝑇_𝑇ℎ𝑃%&'() + =

(5) 
B. Theoretical throughput for the diagnosis and treatment 
phase. 
Unlike other stages of the process for a patient along his 
path through the ED, this is the most complex stage due to its 
non-linearity. All patients first go through an initial medical 
exploration (IE), which is their first contact with the doctor. 
There is a percentage p1 of patients who require additional 
tests after the initial exploration phase with the doctor, and 
also a percentage p2 of patients who require some treatment. 
Treatment is administered and controlled by assistant nurses. 
The return of these patients for the doctor's final diagnosis 
(after completing the complementary examinations requested 
by the doctor after his first contact with the patient (AR)) 
must be taken into account, as the time the doctor uses to see 
these patients again cannot be used to see new patients. The 
rest of patients will be discharged from service directly after 
their first contact with the doctor. 
Figure 7 shows in detail patients' flow along this phase, 
in accordance with all these preliminary considerations. 
The total number of assistant nurses, senior or junior, in 
the considered configuration is represented by NS/NJ 
respectively. The total number of doctors, also senior or 
junior, are represented by DS/DJ, and it is necessary to 
distinguish between: 
• 
DSIE/DJIE: Senior/Junior doctors attending patients 
in the Initial Exploration stage. 
• 
DSAR/DJAR: Senior/Junior doctors attending patients 
in the Analysis of Results stage. 
We consider that doctors prioritize the attention of 
patients who have already gone through the IE (initial 
exploration stage), and therefore, these patients will be 
treated in the time the doctor is available for AR (analysis of 
results). This prevents endless queues on the return of 
patients from their requested complementary examination or 
treatment. 
The Theoretical Throughput (T_ThP) has been defined as 
the number of patients which can be treated by the healthcare 
staff configuration working in each stage of the process, 
being so an indicator of the response capacity of each phase 
or stage. For its calculation in the diagnosis and treatment 
phase, it is necessary to consider the average attention time 
of each type of doctor depending on their experience (Junior 
or Senior), and depending on the type of care they are 
providing, either in the first step of initial exploration (IE), or 
in the second, consisting of the analysis of the results of a 
requested supplementary examination (AR). These times are 
known, determined by the calibration of the simulator, and 
denoted by 𝑃𝑎𝑇+
@ , which represents the average Patient 
Attention Time for a doctor type i doing  j.

From the historical real data provided by the Hospital de 
Sabadell we know that patients can go once, twice or more 
times for tests and/or treatment, and so see the doctor more 
than once (Figure 8). Anyway, for patients 4 and 5, the 
percentage of patients that require more than one test or 
treatment is very low. 
There is a percentage p1 of patients who, after their first 
contact with the doctor, require additional tests, and a 
percentage p2 who require some treatment. Then, there is a 
percentage 1 − (𝑝. + 𝑝N)  of patients who are discharged 
from the service directly after their initial exploration with 
the doctor, those who do not require any additional test nor 
any treatment.

Figure 8.  Percentage of number of diagnostic times (doctor care) 
for non-critical patients (Area B). 
 
By observing the data represented in Figure 8, we can see 
that around 70% of patients 4 and 5 are discharged from the 
service directly after their initial exploration with a doctor. 
Therefore, only 30% of patients in Area B require some test 
or treatment (𝑝. + 𝑝N). Thus, given these percentages and the 
patient flow of Figure 7, we obtain the following relations of 
continuity: 
 
𝑃A,
B; ∙ (𝑝. + 𝑝N) = 𝑃A,
CD

B; ∙ (𝑝. + 𝑝N) = 𝑃A?
CD 
(7) 
 
𝐷𝑆B; + 𝐷𝑆CD = 𝐷𝑆 
(8) 
 
𝐷𝐽B; + 𝐷𝐽CD = 𝐷𝐽 
(9) 
The solution of this linear system of equations gives us the 
values for DSIE, DSAR, DJIE, DJAR, and therefore, the values 
for 𝑃A,
B;, 𝑃A,
CD, 𝑃A?
B;, 𝑃A?
CD, for the considered configuration of 
doctors. 
Now, we can obtain the theoretical throughput for the 
doctors’ stage in the diagnosis and treatment phase by the 
summation of patients who have only been attended once by 
the doctor (Ponly IE), those who have been required for 
additional testing (PTest), and those who have gone to the 
nurses stage for some treatment (PTreat), as shown in (10): 
 
𝑇_𝑇ℎ𝑃ATU&TV% = 𝑃TWXY B; + 𝑃=)%& + 𝑃=V)'& 
(10) 
where: 
 
𝑃TWXY B; = (𝑃A,
B; + 𝑃A?
B;) ∙ (1 − 𝑝. − 𝑝N) 
(11) 
 
𝑃=)%& = (𝑃A,
B; + 𝑃A?
B;) ∙ 𝑝. 
(12) 
 
𝑃=V)'& = (𝑃A,
B; + 𝑃A?
B;) ∙ 𝑝N 
(13) 
 
When we introduce equations (11) to (13) on (10) we 
find: 
 
𝑇_𝑇ℎ𝑃ATU&TV% %&'() = 𝑃𝐷𝑆
𝐼𝐸 + 𝑃𝐷𝐽
𝐼𝐸 
(14) 
so, 
 
𝑇_𝑇ℎ𝑃ATU&TV% %&'() = 𝐷𝑆𝐼𝐸
𝑃𝑎𝑇𝐷𝑆
𝐼𝐸 +
𝐷𝐽𝐼𝐸
𝑃𝑎𝑇𝐷𝐽
𝐼𝐸 
(15) 
 
Moreover, the theoretical throughput for the assistant 
nurses in the treatment stage, inside the diagnosis and 
treatment phase, will be calculated as shown in (5): 
 
𝑇_𝑇ℎ𝑃&V)'&[)W& %&'() =
\,
<'=]0 +
\?
<'=]6  
(16) 
Finally, the theoretical throughput for the diagnosis and 
treatment phase will be the lowest value of (15) and (16), and 
this value will be the indicator for the response capacity to 
patient attention in the ED, assuming that the admission and 
triage phases do not limit this value. 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 
Once we have defined the equations for the calculation of 
the theoretical throughput (T_ThP), we must validate them. 
For this validation we have used the simulator to see if the 
obtained values for the T_ThP for each stage in the ED 
process are in accordance with the generated data by the ED 
simulator. We consider a sufficient rate of patients entering 
into the service, the same each hour, to ensure that the 
system is running continuously and we assume the system is 
in a steady state, after a time of warm up. 
 We 
have 
used 
two 
different 
healthcare 
staff 
configurations (Staff I and II), and we only consider Area B 
for the diagnosis and treatment phase. The corresponding 
obtained values for the T_ThP calculated from the equations 
of the model are presented in Tables I and II, respectively.

The values for PaT in Tables I and II are the average 
values for each phase that result from the calibration of the 
simulator according to real data from the hospital. Moreover, 
it is important to point out that the simulator considers a 
random exponential distribution to model the real behavior 
of the PaT, depending on the type and age of patient. 
We run the simulation for four different values for the 
number of patients entering the service per hour, around the 
theoretical value obtained as reference for the T_ThP for 
each phase from the equations of the model. Next, we 
conduct an analysis of the effect of the number of patients 
entering the service every hour, firstly on the percentage of 
time, which the corresponding healthcare staff spend on 
attending or treating patients (Occupancy) for each phase of 
the whole process, and secondly, on the number of patients 
waiting to be attended in each phase of the process, which 
we call Waiting Queue Length (WQL). 
These are the indicators we use to validate our theoretical 
values. Therefore, we consider that the theoretical value 
obtained from the model is a good approach to the real 
throughput value, when the occupancy of the considered 
staff is below its maximum limit of capacity, and no queues 
are observed for this value, but they are generated when we 
add more patients per hour entering the service and the staff 
in this phase is at 100% of its capacity. 
The analysis presented in the following sections shows 
how the WQL reaches endless values when the input for 
patients reaches and surpasses the obtained T_ThP with the 
model. The obtained results show how this situation 
inevitably leads to over-saturation of the system when we 
increase the simulation time. It is also observed how the 
occupancy of the corresponding staff in each stage reaches 
100% when this happens. 
A. Simulation results for admission phase. 
We first go for the experiments for the validation of the 
T_ThP calculated value for the admissions phase. Once 
fixed, the input parameters for the configuration of the Staff 
I, and according to the results in Table I, we generate a 
constant and homogeneous patients input to ensure a steady 
state for the validation of the obtained values for the T_ThP 
for each phase. The results are shown in Figures 9 and 10. 
The diagram in Figure 9 shows the results for the Staff I 
occupancy in the admissions phase for four different inputs 
of patients around the calculated T_ThP. We observe that the 
bar corresponding to the input of 21 patients per hour for 
admissions staff occupancy goes up to nearly 100% of 
occupancy, which is reached for 22 patients. This means that, 
with 22 or more patients, the admission phase has surpassed 
its limit of capacity, so this simulation result is in accordance 
with the T_ThP obtained with the analytical model for 
admissions phase in Table I. This first check validates this 
value. 
On the other hand, Figure 10 shows the evolution on 
WQL with time, that is, the number of patients in the queue 
in the waiting room for this phase of the ED process 
depending on the number of simulated days, and for the

same four different input values for the number of patients 
entering the system.  
The WQL is under control until the number of patients 
reaches and exceeds the obtained 22 patients for the T_ThP 
with the model, when it reaches endless values. 
We proceed now with the validation of the admissions 
T_ThP value for the configuration in Staff II (see now Table 
II). Figures 11 and 12 show the results for the Staff II 
occupancy in the admissions phase and the WQL evolution 
again for four different inputs of patients around the 
calculated value for T_ThP. 
When the input is 17 patients per hour, the admissions 
staff occupancy almost reaches its limit of capacity, and no 
important queues are generated. See how the bar of 17 
patients/hr in the diagram in Figure 11 goes up to nearly 
100% of occupancy, and temporal lines in Figure 12 for 17 
or less patients per hour do not lead to saturation of the 
system, but only one more patient per hour entering the 
service produces endless queues. This simulation result is in 
accordance with the T_ThP obtained with the model (17.5 
patients per hour) and so, it validates this value. 
The fluctuations observed in the temporal lines in Figures  
10 and 12 are due to the distribution used by the simulator to 
consider the variation of PaT depending on both the type and 
age of patients. The simulator uses an exponential 
distribution to model this fact, as a result of its calibration 
with the available real data from the hospital. These 
variations in the random values assigned to PaT for each 
generated patient can produce some queues, which appear 
anytime but, which the system can finally absorb if the 
number of patients entering the service per hour is below the 
system’s capacity of attention. 
Hereinafter, we proceed in the same way for validating 
the remaining values for T_ThP corresponding to the other 
stages: triage, doctors and nursing for treatment in the 
diagnosis and treatment phase. 
B. Simulation results for triage phase. 
The simulation results for the validation of the T_ThP 
value considering Staff I for the triage phase are shown in 
Figures 13 and 14. The bar chart of Figure 13 shows that the 
maximum attention capacity for this phase is 20 patients per 
hour, since it is for this value when 100% occupancy of the 
healthcare staff responsible for this stage is reached. 
In Figure 14, we can observe the evolution of the WQL 
for the triage phase, again for four different inputs of 
patients. Endless queues are formed when 20 or more 
patients per hour enter the service, which is its limit of 
capacity. Meanwhile, there are no queues for values under 
the T_ThP calculated in Table I. This simulation result is 
again in accordance with the T_ThP obtained with the 
model, so it validates this value for the triage T_ThP. 
Figures 15 and 16 show the WQL for the triage phase for 
Staff II and the corresponding staff occupancy respectively, 
for four different inputs of patients. When the input is 17 
patients per hour, the triage staff occupancy nearly reaches 
the 100%, so it is almost at its limit of capacity. Only one 
patient more per hour collapses the system in this stage, as

the temporal line shows in Figure 16 for 18 patients per hour 
entering the system. 
This simulation result is in accordance with the T_ThP 
obtained with the analytical model (Table II), so it validates 
this value for the triage T_ThP for staff configuration II. 
Once again the fluctuations observed in Figure 16 are due 
to the random exponential distribution used by the simulator 
to consider the variation of PaT.  
C. Simulation results for diagnosis and treatment phase. 
Here only patients 4 and 5 are considered, since we are 
analyzing the behavior in Area B, where non-critical patients 
are treated. According to data presented in Figure 8, the 
probability of these patients requiring some additional test or 
treatment has been fixed at 30%.  
Figures 17 and 18 show the simulation experimental 
results for the doctor’s stage of the diagnosis, considering the 
staff I configuration in Table I. In Figure 17, we can see the 
corresponding staff occupancy for this stage, for four 
different inputs of patients. Here, the T_ThP value obtained 
from the equations is 14.68 patients per hour. The simulation 
data shows how the occupancy for 14 patients per hour is 
almost at 100%, and also the analysis for the WQL shows 
how doctors are saturated when only one more patient per 
hour enters the service. Once again the T_ThP is at its limit 
of capacity and when this value is surpassed, the system 
collapses in this phase. These results are in accordance with 
the doctors’ T_ThP obtained with the model and hence 
validate it. 
In the same way, Figures 19 and 20 show the staff 
occupation rate and the WQL tendency for the doctors’ stage, 
within the diagnosis and treatment phase for Staff II, again 
for four different inputs of patients. The probabilities for 
patients to require some additional test or treatment have also 
been fixed at 30%.  
The T_ThP is between 10 and 11 patients, and we can see 
how when the input is of 11 patients per hour, medical staff 
occupancy reaches 100%. Therefore, this simulation result 
shows the system has surpassed its limit of capacity and this 
is in accordance with the T_ThP obtained with the model. 
Long and non-ending queues also collapse the service for 11 
or more patients. Once again, this validates the obtained 
value for the Doctors T_ThP in this case. 
Finally, we try to validate T_ThP for the for treatment 
stage, carried out by the assistant nurses inside the diagnosis 
and treatment phase. Figures 21 and 22 show the simulation 
results for this stage when we consider the specific 
configuration for the healthcare staff specified in Table I. 
The obtained values by simulation for the occupation rate 
are in accordance with our theoretical value of 25.56 patients 
per hour (Figure 21), when the number of patients waiting 
for treatment grows dramatically and the WQL becomes very 
large (Figure 22). Also, with the staff II configuration, the 
obtained values for occupation in the nursing stage are in 
accordance with our theoretical value of 14.67 patients per 
hour (Figure 23), and again the number of patients waiting 
for attention grows dramatically (Figure 24).

In Figures 23 and 24 we can see how the simulation 
results for the nursing stage are once more in accordance 
with the model when we modify the staff parameters to Staff 
II configuration. 
All the values of T_ThP for admission, triage, doctors 
and nurses have been validated, and they are in accordance 
with the simulation results with a very good approximation. 
The simulator is our sensor of the real system, so these 
results validate the proposed analytical model. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The main contribution presented in this paper is the ED's 
healthcare staff characterization, through its capacity, named 
theoretical throughput, which is the number of patients that 
the system should be able to absorb per unit time, given the 
staff composition. 
We have defined an analytical model to determine the 
theoretical throughput of a particular healthcare staff 
configuration based on the number of admission staff, triage, 
assistant nurses, and doctors, and their respective attention 
times for patients. 
The analytical model of equations to calculate the values 
of the T_ThP for admissions phase, triage phase, nursing and 
medical exploration stages in diagnosis and treatment phase, 
according to the actual patient flow in the ED process, has 
been validated. For the validation of the model we have used 
an ED simulator based on an agent based model of the 
system, as a sensor of the real system. Output data from 
simulation of different possible real situations have been 
analyzed to obtain the information for the model validation.  
We have seen how the theoretical throughput is a 
reference to measure the performance of the system, and the 
capacity of the healthcare staff configuration to absorb the 
demand of the service, so it is an indicator of the response 
capacity of the system to patient attention. 
The analytical model for the T_ThP calculation will give 
us information to relocate non-critical patients, so that the 
theoretical throughput will be the reference indicator for the 
redistribution of non-critical patients. The idea is to try to 
modify their current arrival according to system capacity at 
any time, which is our current research in progress. This 
relocation may improve the time patients stay in the service, 
and therefore the service quality.  
Our future work will consist of designing a admission 
scheduling model for non-critical patients in the service, 
using the ED simulator for their LoS prediction. 
The historical data provided by the hospital, the defined 
analytical model for the evaluation of the response capacity 
of the system, and the information obtained from the analysis 
of the data from simulation, will all enable the possibility of 
planning admission of non-critical patients into the service. 
This proposed future model for relocation of patients will 
be efficient to the extent that a supposed “self-triage and 
recommendation system” is effective on patient entry, so that 
patient input curve gets flatter and approaches the value 
corresponding to the maximum capacity of the system, and 
therefore, an improvement in performance is expected. 
A good relocation of non-critical patients and a 
significant improvement in the quality of service mean a

reduction on LoS of patients in the service, without removing 
patients, which in some cases, could make the reduction of 
under-utilized resources possible. 
Finally, and more generally, our global proposal aims to 
improve the ED service, which is the main entry of patients 
in the healthcare system in relation to access, quality of 
service, user satisfaction and efficiency.
