Abstract—In this paper, a novel topology using generalized
current follower differential input transconductance ampliﬁer
(GCFDITA), which is suitable to realize several current-
mode (CM) analog functions is presented. The topology is
created using a single GCFDITA, a maximum of two grounded
passive elements and can realize CM ampliﬁer, integrator,
ﬁrst-order low-pass, high-pass, and all-pass ﬁltering functions.
The workability of one of the GCFDITA variants, namely the
current inverter differential input transconductance ampliﬁer
(CIDITA) is proved by SPICE simulation results, based on the
commercially available ICs OPA860 by Texas Instruments, and
is in good accordance with theoretical predictions.

topology; all-pass ﬁlter.
I. INTRODUCTION
Analog frequency ﬁlters are widely used as anti-aliasing
video ﬁlters in the analog sections of high-speed data
communication systems deﬁned by ITU BT 601 standard,
for signal processing in wireless LANs described by IEEE
802.11 standard, measurement systems, etc. [1]–[3]. One of
the most often used versatile modern current-mode (CM)
active building blocks (ABBs) is the current differenc-
ing transconductance ampliﬁer (CDTA) [4]. In the current
technical literature, numerous publications providing sev-
eral simple circuit solutions using CDTA can be found.
These include CM biquadratic ﬁlters [4], [5], ﬁrst-order
all-pass ﬁlters [6], [7], higher-order ﬁlters [1], [8], full-
wave CM precision rectiﬁers [9], or sinusoidal oscillators
[10]. However, many of the aforementioned circuits only
partially utilize the input p or n terminals of the CDTA.
In such cases, the input current differencing unit (CDU) is
reduced to a current follower (CF) or current inverter (CI).
This fact has been the ﬁrst time noticed in [11] and later
in [12], and which led to the evolution of a generalized
current follower transconductance ampliﬁer (GCFTA) [13].
Depending on the value of the conveyance coefﬁcients, six
types of CFTA variants can be deﬁned. In general, these
are the CFTA and the inverted CFTA (ICFTA) [13]–[19].
In one of more recent article [20], Biolek and Biolkova
introduced a modiﬁed version of GCFTA with buffered
voltage outputs and transconductance of conventional CDTA
or GCFTA changed to differential input transconductance
ampliﬁer. Limiting this work to the circuits with only current
inputs and current outputs, in this paper, we provide a new
ABB called generalized current follower differential input
transconductance ampliﬁer (GCFDITA), which as compared
to [20] does not have a buffered voltage output terminal.
This modiﬁcation leads to simpler internal structure, and
subsequently, less power consumption of its applications.
An important advantage of GCFDITA is also that it can
be easily created using commercially available ICs OPA860
[21].
II. PROPOSED CIRCUIT
A generalized current follower differential input transcon-
ductance ampliﬁer (GCFDITA) has positive or negative cur-
rent follower input that transfers the input current at terminal
f to the z terminal and a balanced-output differential input
transconductance ampliﬁer (BO-DITA) stage, which is used
to convert the difference voltage between the z and v
terminals to balanced output currents. The transconductance
parameter gm corresponds for the positive output and −gm
for the negative output. The circuit symbol of GCFDITA is
shown in Figure 1. In general, the equations characterizing
an ideal GCFDITA are:
Vf = 0, Iz = aIf, Iv = 0, Ix+ = −Ix− = gm(Vz − Vv),
(1)
where a ∈ {1, −1}. Depending on the values of a, two
variants of GCFDITA are possible, namely current follower
differential input transconductance ampliﬁer (CFDITA) for

a = 1 (let us label the input terminal as p) and cur-
rent inverter differential input transconductance ampliﬁer
(CIDITA) for a = −1 (its input terminal is labeled as n).
The proposed general circuit topology used to realized
several CM analog functions is shown in Figure 2(a).
Recently, a similar general topology for realizing multiple
voltage-mode (VM) analog functions using differential volt-
age current conveyor (DVCC) has been proposed in [22].
However, it is worth mention that the circuit in [22] does
not provide a low-pass and high-pass ﬁltering functions that
can also be realized by here proposed general topology.
Considering the used ABB to be a CIDITA (i.e. a = −1)
and doing routine circuit analysis using (1), the output
current can be expressed as follows:
Iout = gm(I1Z1 − I2Z2)
gmZ1 + 1
.
(2)
By appropriately choosing different impedances (Z1 and
Z2 - as combinations of resistor and capacitor) and current
inputs (I1 and I2), various CM analog functions can be
derived. For example, with I1 = I2 = Iin, Z1 = 1/sC
and Z2 = R, the transfer function (TF) becomes:
T(s) = Iout
Iin
= −gm(sCR − 1)
sC + gm
.
(3)
The above TF represents an all-pass (AP) ﬁlter under the
condition gmR = 1. If it is satisﬁed, the phase response of
the ﬁlter is given as:
ϕ(ω) = −2tan−1(ωCR) = −2tan−1
ωC
gm

.
(4)
It is worth noting that here proposed AP circuit uses all
grounded passive elements, a feature which is absent in
previously reported CDTA based APF in [6].
III. NON-IDEALITIES OF THE CIDITA
For a complete analysis of the AP ﬁlter, it is important
to take into account the non-idealities of CIDITA shown in
Figure 3:
• Iz = −αIn, Ix+ = β1gmVd, Ix− = −β2gmVd, where
Vd = Vz −Vv, α = 1−ε1, β1 = 1−ε2 and β2 = 1−ε3.

• The non-zero parasitic input resistance at terminal n of
the CIDITA is represented by Rn, which typical value
in case of implementation by ICs OPA860 in Figure 4
is 10.5 Ω.
• The parasitic resistance Rz and parasitic capacitance
Cz appear between the high output impedance z termi-
nal of the CIDITA and ground and their typical values
are 455 kΩ||2.1 pF. The parasitic capacitance Cz is
absorbed into external capacitor C as it appears in shunt
with it and in Figure 3 labeled as C′.
• The parasitic resistance Rv and parasitic capacitance
Cv appear between the high input impedance v terminal
of the CIDITA and ground and their typical values are
equal to z terminal parasitics. The parasitic resistance
Rv is absorbed into external resistor R as it appears in
shunt with it and labeled as R′.
• The parasitic impedances appearing between the high-
impedance x terminals of the CIDITA and ground. For
the circuit in Figure 3, these impedances are modeled
at terminal x− by Rx− and Cx− that represent the par-
asitic resistance and parasitic capacitance, respectively,
and their typical values are 54 kΩ||2 pF.
Considering the aforementioned tracking errors and para-
sitic capacitances, the ideal TF (3) turns to:
T(s) = Iout

(sC′ + αβ2gm)(sCv + 1

Now, the zero ωz and pole ωp frequencies are not equal
and can be expressed as:
ωz =

ωp = αβ2gm

.
(7)
It should be noted that, the angular pole frequency ωp
differs from the corresponding angular zero frequency ωz
and thus this mismatch affects both the magnitude and phase
response of the circuit. Hence, to receive ωz = ωp precise
matching condition gmR = 1 and careful design of CIDITA
with values of α, β1 and β2 close to unity are needed.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In order to verify the workability of the designed AP ﬁlter
shown in Figure 2(b), it has been simulated using SPICE
software. Figure 4 shows the implementation of the CIDITA
using commercially available ICs, e.g., the OPA860 by Texas
Instruments [21]. The DC power supply voltages of OPA860
SPICE macromodels were equal to ±5 V. The OPA860
contains the so-called ‘diamond’ transistor (DT) and fast
voltage buffer (VB). In the output stage, in order to increase
the linearity of collector currents versus input voltage Vd, the
DT3 and DT4 are complemented with degeneration resistor
RG≫1/gmT , added in series to the emitters, where the gmT
is the DT transconductance. Then the total transconductance
decreases to the approximate value 1/RG. In simulations the
passive element values were selected as follows: C = 100
pF and R = RG = 1 kΩ, and hence, the above mentioned
matching condition gmR = 1 (R = RG) is fulﬁlled. In this
case, a 90◦ phase shift is at pole frequency fp ∼= 1.59 MHz.
Figure 5(a) shows the ideal and simulated gain and phase
responses of the proposed ﬁlter, from which the obtained fp
is 1.44 MHz. Time-domain simulation result of the proposed
ﬁlter is shown in Figure 5(b) in which a sinusoidal input
current signal with 1 mA peak value at 1.44 MHz is applied
to the ﬁlter. The total harmonic distortion at this frequency is
found as 0.102%. The Fourier spectrum of the output signal,
showing a high selectivity for the applied signal frequency, is
shown in Figure 5(c). The Lissajous pattern for the circuit as
−90◦ phase shifter is shown in Figure 5(d). The total power
dissipation of the circuit is found to be 204 µW. From the
simulation results it can be seen that the ﬁnal solution is in
good agreement with the theory.

V. CONCLUSION
The paper presented a novel general topology suitable
to realize several current-mode analog functions. It is cre-
ated using single versatile ABB, namely the generalized
current follower differential input transconductance ampli-
ﬁer (GCFDITA) and maximum of two grounded passive
components. As an example, ﬁrst-order all-pass ﬁlter has
been derived and SPICE simulation results of the proposed
ﬁlter have been provided. It is expected that GCFDITA
would prove to be a versatile ABB for the general design of
active ﬁlters and sinusoidal oscillators. It is worth mention
that a similar general circuit is proposed for voltage-mode
functions in [22], however, in [22] the low-pass and high-
pass ﬁltering functions are not provided.
