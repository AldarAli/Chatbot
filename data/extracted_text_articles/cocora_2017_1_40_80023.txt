Abstract—The rapidly increasing popularity of WiFi has created
unprecedent levels of congestion in the unlicensed frequency
bands, especially in densely populated urban areas. This results
mainly because of the uncoordinated operation and the unman-
aged interference between WiFi access points. Recently, Radio
Environment Maps (REM) have been suggested as a support for
coordination strategies that optimize the overall WiFi network
performance. Despite some theoretical work done in this area,
there are no clear experimental evidences of the beneﬁt brought
by WiFi coordination. In this context, the main objective of this
experiment is to assess the beneﬁt of a coordinated management
of radio resources in dense WiFi networks using REMs for
indoor scenarios. This experiment has used the w-iLab.t test
environment provided by iMINDS, a cognitive-radio testbed for
remote experimentation. It was shown that REMs are capable
of detecting the presence of interfering links on the network
(co-channel or adjacent channel interference), and a suitable
coordination strategy can use this information to reconﬁgure
Access Points (AP) channel assignment and reestablish the client
connection. The coordination strategy almost double the capacity
of a WiFi link under strong co–channel interference, from
6.8 Mbps to 11.8 Mbps, increasing the aggregate throughput
of the network from 58.7 Mbps to 71.5 Mbps. However, this
gain comes with the cost of a relatively high density network
of spectrum sensors (12 sensors for an area of 60 × 20 m),
increasing the cost of deployment.

INTRODUCTION
During the last ﬁfteen years, the WiFi technology, as a
last mile access to Internet, has experienced global explo-
sion. Nowadays, the WiFi networks carry more trafﬁc to
and from end-users terminals (PCs, tablets, and smartphones)
than Ethernet and cellular networks combined. The success
of this technology is owed to its introduction in unlicensed
spectrum (ISM bands), which has furthermore allowed un-
precedented innovation in the wireless technology. However,
as the penetration of WiFi continues, the unlicensed bands are
becoming overcrowded. Unpredictable user-deployed hot spots
(smartphone) are a new source of interference and instability
that can undermine the network performance. Moreover, many
Internet of Things (IoT) devices also share the unlicensed
spectrum with WiFi, which further increases the problem scale.
In fact, interference is a limit factor of WiFi densiﬁcation; this
is a result mainly because of the uncoordinated operation and
the unmanaged interference between the WiFi Access Points
(AP). In WiFi, each Access Point can only access locally
available sensing information within single cell coverage. It
cannot access global knowledge on a multi-AP network and
the deployment environment, leading to a sub-optimal network
conﬁguration.
In this context, the design of the WiFi networks is complex
because of the high-density of users and signiﬁcant variability
of capacity requirements that can be strongly dependent on
location and time. The variability of the capacity demand can
be faced by deploying a dynamic network infrastructure, in
which WiFi access points can be switched on and off, can
work on different bands, and can tune their coverage range
according to the network status and QoS requirements.
Several research works have claimed that a coordinated ap-
proach of the Radio Resource Management (RRM) of channel
frequency and power can increase the performance of WiFi
networks in dense deployment scenarios [1], and have recently
demonstrated the potential economic value of WiFi coordina-
tion in dense indoor Experiments [2]. Other research work
claims that an important input for interference management
and coordination strategies is the Radio Environment Map
(REM) of the target coverage area. The REM is a dataset of
spectrum occupancy and interference levels computed based
on raw spectrum measurements, propagation modelling and
spatial interpolation algorithms [3]. RRM algorithms can use
REMs to optimize the overall network performance. In spite
of several theoretical studies on the coordinated management
of WiFi networks [1], there is no experimental evidences of
the beneﬁts promised by the academic or industrial research
studies.
The main objective of this experiment is to assess the
beneﬁt of a coordinated approach in dense WiFi networks
that make use of realistic Radio Environment Maps, using
an implementation-oriented approach in a wireless testbed
environment. An important performance metric is the gain
in terms of average throughput, comparing the coordinated
approaches with the legacy uncoordinated approach. In partic-
ular, we are interested in measuring the average capacity gain,
when using market available and low cost spectrum sensors in
very dense indoor scenarios. The results of this experiment
are very useful from a business perspective and industrial

research, in order to realize if the actual coordination gain
is sufﬁcient enough to justify the investment in the sensing
and the signalling infrastructure needed to implement a WiFi
coordination scheme in realistic scenarios [3].
This paper is organised in four sections. The ﬁrst section
introduces the background and describes the motivation of
the work. In Section II, we describe the testbed and deﬁne
the setup environment of the experiments. The third section
presents the experimental results with different measurements.
Conclusions and future work are drawn in Section IV.

SETUP OF THE EXPERIMENT
This section deﬁnes and describes in detail the setup
environment of the experiment.
A. Setup architecture
The setup diagram of the demonstrator, depicted in Fig-
ure 1, encompasses four major components, as brieﬂy ex-
plained in the following:
•
A network of spectrum sensors (energy detectors) that
report spectrum measurements to a database.
•
A REM builder module that computes the radio en-
vironmental maps based on measurements stored in
the spectrum database, the positions/conﬁgurations of
radio transmitters (AP), indoor propagation models
and spatial interpolation algorithms.
•
The RRM that optimizes the overall WiFi network in
terms of channel and power allocation based on the
REM.
•
WiFi APs that receive the conﬁguration settings and
reports performance metrics to the RRM module.
B. Testbed and resources allocation
All experiments took place in a shielded environment in the
W-iLab.t testbed (Ghent – Belgium). The nodes are installed
in an open room (66 m by 21 m) in a grid conﬁguration.
Figure 2 shows the testing area and the locations of the
nodes, represented by blue numbered circles. Each node has
one embedded PC (ZOTAC) with two wireless IEEE 802.11
a/b/g/n cards (Spartklan WPEA–110N/E/11n), a spectrum
sensor (Wi-Spy USB spectrum analyzer), one Gigabit LAN,
and also a Bluetooth USB 2.0 Interface and a ZigBee sensor
node.
We have selected 5 equidistant links in a Client – Server
conﬁguration, represented by a black arrow in Figure 2. The
distance between adjacent links is 12 m, and for each link,
the distance between the client node and the AP node is
3.6 m. The red arrow represents the interfering link, with a
separation of 12.53 m between nodes.
Besides the available WiFi hardware, the testbed offers
several software tools to setup, control and gather radio
measurements. We used the java-based framework jFed [4] to
conﬁgure the testbed nodes. jFed is also used to activate nodes,
install the Operating System, and SSH into the nodes. OMF6
[5] controls all the experiments, using scripts written with
OMF Experiment Description Language (OEDL) [6], which
is based on the Ruby programming language. The experiment
description with OMF6 is structured in two main steps:
1)
First, we declare the resources to be used in the
experiment, such as applications, nodes, and related
conﬁgurations, such as Wi-Fi channels and transmit-
ted power;
2)
In the second step, we deﬁne the events that triggers
the experiment’s execution, and the tasks to be exe-
cuted.
The Iperf trafﬁc generator tool [7] generates data for
each link using a client-server conﬁguration for each link.
All links parameters are recorded during 100 seconds for
all experiments. This ensures that the radio signals for the
links under test are on the air and stable. The measurements
data are extracted during the experiment using OML [8].
OML is a stand-alone tool that parses and reports all the
measurements to a database (SQLite3 or PostgreSQL) installed
on the experiment controller server of the testbed.
C. Radio Environment Map builder
The REM is a dataset of spectrum occupancy computed
based on raw spectrum measurements, propagation modelling
and spatial interpolation algorithms.
There are several methods to compute REMs available
on the literature, with different interpolation approaches and
based on space and time spectrum measurements. One of
the most commonly used methods is the Inverse Distance
Weighted Interpolation (IDW) [3]. Despite the ”bull’s eyes”
effect, this method is relatively fast and efﬁcient, and present
good properties for smoothing REM. In order to decrease the
sensitiveness to outlier measurements, we have implemented
a modiﬁed version of IDW method, which calculates the
interpolated values using only the nearest neighbour’s points.
In order to compute the REM, the exact position of each
radio node on the w-iLab.t testbed area is deﬁned as shown
in Figure 2. REMs are computed using Matlab to facilitate
the integration with the RRM algorithms, also implemented in
Matlab.
D. RRM coordinating strategies
The RRM optimizes the overall WiFi network conﬁgu-
ration in terms of channel, and power allocation based on
the information provided by the REM. The adopted RRM
strategies during the experiments are the following [1]:

•
Strategy 1: Allocate the WiFi links to disjoint, non-
overlapping bands and use minimum possible transmit
power for each WiFi link;
•
Strategy 2: Optimize the transmit power of multiple
WiFi links, when interference is detected.
III.
EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
After describing the setup architecture and the testbed
resources, we will explain the experimental measurement cam-
paigns. Each set of measurement aims at studying the inﬂuence
of measurable interference characteristics on the throughput of
the WiFi network under study. The process was structured in
four steps:
1)
Spectrum measurements from the spectrum sensors
in all WiFi frequency channels;
2)
Compute the REMs based on spectrum measurements
and IDW algorithm;
3)
Measure and record the throughput of the radio links;
4)
Apply the coordination strategy, e.g., reconﬁgure the
channel allocation or the transmitted power of each
APs.
A. Estimation of the path-loss propagation model
Having a suitable propagation model is a key element to
build good REMs, therefore before running the experiments,
we have measured the path loss between the clients and
the APs in the w-iLab.t test environment to estimate the
propagation model parameters. Since the majority of the nodes
are in Line–of–Sight (LoS) and relatively closed to each other,
as shown in Figure 2, we have considered a Free Space Path
Loss (FSPL) model:
L = n (10log10 (d) + 10log10 (f)) + 32.45 (dB)
(1)
Where L is the path loss in dB, d is the distance in meters,
f is the frequency in GHz and n is the path loss exponent,
which is 2 in the FSPL model. The path-loss measurement
process was implemented as follows:
1)
Setup one node as an AP with 5 dBm transmit power
(PT x) on WiFi Channel 1 (f = 2.412 GHz), and all
the other nodes as clients.
2)
For each client:
•
Measure the Received Signal Strength Indica-
tion (RSSI) of the AP, denoted as PRx.
•
Measure the distance d between the client and
the AP.
3)
Setup a different node as AP and the remaining nodes
as clients.
4)
Repeat steps 1), 2) and 3).
The blue dots on Figure 3 represent the results of the
measurement campaign.
Considering Friis transmission equation, L = PT x (dBm)−
PRx (dBm), combined with (1), we compute an estimate of the
path loss exponent n [9],
PT x − PRx = n (10log10 (d) + 10log10 (f)) + 32.45
⇔
n =
PT x − PRx − 32.45
10log10 (d) + 10log10 (f)
(2)
Using (2) with the Fitting Toolbox provided by Matlab
and the measured RSSI (PRx), the value of n was found to
be 2.097, with a 95% conﬁdence bounds [2.084, 2.109]. This
experimentally determined value corresponds to what we are
expecting for a LoS scenario. The red curve in Figure 3 shows
the result of the ﬁtting process.
Appropriate AP power levels are essential to maintaining
a coverage area, not only to ensure correct (not maximum)
amount of power covering an area, but also to ensure that
excessive power is not used, which would add unnecessary
interference to the radiating area. Transmitted power can be
minimised to reduce interference among the APs.
Considering a typical baseline signal strength of -65 dBm
for the WiFi received signals coming from adjacent cells, using
(1) and n = 2.097, we have computed the optimal transmit
power as a function of the distance, as depicted in Figure 4.
This study is important to setup the initial APs transmit power
to ensure a suitable cell coverage. Considering that 12 m is
the separation between adjacent WiFi cells in the experiment
set-up (Figure 2), the APs transmit power are set at 0 dBm,
unless otherwise noted in the following experiments.

B. Measurement 1: Assessment of the channel distribution
inﬂuence on the throughput
The aim of this experiment is to assess the inﬂuence of
channel distribution on the throughput, and verify the worst-
case reference scenario in terms of intra–network co-channel
interference, e.g., when all APs assigned to the same channel
( Channel 1 – 2.412 GHz).
The average values of the measured throughput for each
link and the aggregated throughput of the WiFi network are
shown in Table I. As expected, the low values of link’s
throughput are due to the strong co-channel interference that
limits the overall performance of the network. Note that this
is a worst-case reference scenario in terms of co-channel
interference.

C. Measurement 2: Considering no-overlapping channels as-
signment – baseline scenario
With this experiment, all APs are conﬁgured with non-
overlapping channels: Channel 1 (2.412 GHz), Channel 6
(2.437 GHz) and Channel 11 (2.462 GHz). The measured
throughput presented in Table II clearly shows the advantage
of using non-overlapping channels in the WiFi planning. With
a transmitted power set to 0 dBm on each APs, the measured
aggregated throughput is 71.50 Mbps, i.e., more than three
times higher than the value in Measurement 1 (22.34 Mbps).
However, if the transmitted power PT x is increased to 5 dBm,
the aggregate throughput decreases to 66.05 Mbps, because
of the higher co-channel interference between Link 1 and
Link 4, and between Link 2 and Link 5. Note that according to
Figure 4, with 5 dBm, the APs have 22 m coverage radius.This
channel conﬁguration is the baseline for the following mea-
surements.
D. Measurement 3: Channel reallocation triggered by co-
channel interference
The setup for Measurement 3 has the same non-overlapping
channels allocation as in Measurement 2, with an additional in-
terference Link active at Channel 11, placed next to Link 2, as
depicted in Figure 2. Three different interference power levels
(PI) were applied during the experiment {0, 7, 15}(dBm). The
computed REMs at channel 11 for different interference link’s
power are shown in Figure 5(a). The color gradient represents
the computed power in dBm for a particular channel at location
(x, y). The location of the nodes is added as an additional
layer (black circles). The yellow dots are due the ”bull’s eye”
effect typical of the IDW interpolation algorithm and should
be discarded. It can be seen that by observing the REMs, we
can detect not only Link 2 and Link 5, but also the extra
radio activity coming from the interfering link. Note that the
detection of this interfering link will trigger the coordination
strategy in the WiFi network.
The results from Table III shows an overall network
throughput decrease, compared with the results from Measure-
ment 2, mainly due to the interference from the interfering link
on Link 2 and Link 5. However, the results indicate that the
variation on the power level of the interferer doesn’t have a
strong impact on the aggregate throughput.
From the REM information, the coordination strategy re-
allocates the WiFi channels among the APs, in order to avoid
strong co-channel interference. The REM for Channel 11,
depicted in Figure 5(b), shows a clear spatial separation
between the interference source and Link 4.

The aggregate throughput is now close to the values obtained
with Measurement 2, i.e., without any interference Link. Once
again, the results indicate that the variation on the power level
of the interferer doesn’t have a strong impact on the aggregated
throughput.
E. Measurement 4: Channel reallocation triggered by adja-
cent channel interference
With this experiment, we want to understand how the WiFi
network is affected by strong adjacent channel interference and

how effective is the coordination strategy under such circum-
stances. The interfering link is set to operate on Channel 10,
while Link 2 uses Channel 11. In the case of adjacent channel
interference, the REM generated for channel X has to take into
account the power received from adjacent channels X±n ∈ N,
weighted according to the spectral mask of the ﬁlter present at
the WiFi receiver [10]. The weighting factors of the transmit
mask are listed in Table IV. Note that each WiFi channel is
22 MHz wide, but the channel separation is only 5 MHz. As
an example, the power of the 4th adjacent-channel should be
reduced by 28 dB to be correctly used in the computation of
the REM.
The results from Table V show an overall network through-
put decrease, compared with the results obtained from Mea-
surements 3 and 4. This result shows that the ﬁrst adjacent-
channel interference leads to a higher throughput degradation
than a co-channel interference (no–interference: 71.5 Mbps,
co–channel interference: 58.6 Mbps and adjacent–channel in-
terference: 56.7 Mbps). Once again, the results also indicate
that the variation on the power level of the interferer doesn’t
have a strong impact on the aggregate throughput.
F. Measurement 5: Automatic power control to overcome co-
channel interference
The aim of this experiment is to understand if automatic
power control is a good strategy to overcome co-channel
interference. The setup of the network under test has ﬁve
links using non-overlapping channels, with an additional co–
channel interference link in Channel 11. The RRM strategy in
this experiment keeps the same channel assignment of each
29

link and increases the power of the victim link (Link 2).
The transmitted power increases in steps of 5 dB, from 0 to
15 dBm. The remaining APs of the network under test remains
at 0 dBm, and the interfering link is set to transmit 5 dBm in
Channel 11. The measured throughput is listed in Table VI.
The results suggest that, despite the increase of transmitted
power on Link 2, the overall throughput remains low and
approximately constant (roughly 58 Mbps), therefore, power
increase alone does not overcome the degradation caused by
strong co-channel interference. The WiFi coordination strategy
investigated in Measurement 3 is much more effective, leading
to an aggregated throughput of 71 Mbps.
IV.
CONCLUSION
This paper presented the testing of WiFi coordination
strategies that exploits information from Radio Environment
Maps, based upon ﬁve exploratory measurement campaigns in
a pseudo-shielded testbed environment.
The overall performance of the WiFi network depends on
a smart channel allocation. As an example, for the network
under test, we’ve got an aggregated throughput of 22.3 Mbps
in a full co-channel interference scenario and 71.5 Mbps using
a conﬁguration of non overlapping channels. It was shown
that based on the observation of REMs, it is possible to
detect the presence of interfering links (co-channel and ﬁrst
adjacent channel). First adjacent-channel interference leads to
a higher throughput degradation than a co-channel interference
with the same power level (no-interference: 71.5 Mbps, co-
channel interference: 58.6 Mbps and adjacent-channel interfer-
ence: 56.7 Mbps). The coordination strategy that automatically
reallocates WiFi channels to avoid channel overlapping is
very beneﬁcial (e.g., the aggregated throughput goes from
58.7 Mbps to 71.5 Mbps, the link under interference goes
from 6.8 Mbps to 11.8 Mbps). however, In case of strong co-
channel interference, the strategy of automatically increase the
power level of the victim link, when keeping the same channel
allocation, does not bring any gain in terms of measured
throughput.
For the RRM to be efective, 12 sensor nodes (energy
detectors) were needed for an area of 60 m × 20m, to create a
REM with enough spatial resolution. The additional hardware
required for spectrum sensing, inter–cell signalling and REM
building may increase the investment by 50 %, when compared
to an uncoordinated WiFi network. However, by implementing
an coordinated management of radio resources, the overall
throughput in WiFi network was increased more than 200 %,
even in the presence of interfering links.
Future research on this work includes testing of the
proposed setup architecture in the WiFi 5 GHz band, with
