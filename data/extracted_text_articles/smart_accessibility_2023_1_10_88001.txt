Abstract—Ever since the ratification of Directive 2016/2102 
(Web Accessibility Directive) and EU Directive 2019/882 
(European Accessibility Act), digital accessibility has been 
gaining in importance for public administration and business 
within the European Union. Furthermore, the role of companies 
has changed during the last decades and the concept of 
corporate social responsibility has become increasingly relevant 
for multinational enterprises. As one aspect of Corporate Social 
Responsibility, digital accessibility can bring a lot of advantages, 
for example by driving innovation or by enhancing a company's 
brand. Therefore, even companies that do not have to meet legal 
requirements should act with digital accessibility in mind as one 
part of their Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. In the 
current literature and legal regulations, digital accessibility is 
mostly described as a technical issue, while organizational, 
structural 
aspects 
and 
managerial 
tasks 
within 
the 
implementation of digital accessibility are ignored. By reviewing 
current literature, this meta study shows the relevance of digital 
accessibility for multinational companies, explains why the 
implementation of digital accessibility cannot only be 
considered from a technical point of view and discusses initial 
approaches to examine the integration of digital accessibility 
into company-wide processes. 
Keywords-Strategic Management; Digital Accessibility by 
Design; Corporate Social Responsibility; Society 5.0. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
To examine the status quo of digital accessibility in 
multinational enterprises, 77 papers have been analysed, 
which are linked with the keywords "digital accessibility", 
"strategy" and “enterprises”, mostly focusing on papers and 
books from the years 2018 to 2023. The analysis included the 
electronic databases such as Web of science, SCOPUS, 
JSTOR, SSRN and b On. After a first review, 19 papers were 
selected as relevant for this article. Digital accessibility refers 
to the extent to which digital products, resources, and services 
(hardware, software, websites) and digital content are 
available for people with disabilities [1] [2]. According to the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), software, websites and 
mobile applications must be “POUR” (perceivable, operable, 
understandable, and robust) to be accessible [3] [4].  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes why it is important for companies to implement 
digital accessibility into their company-wide processes. In 
Section III, it lays forth why digital accessibility is not only a 
technical issue. In Section IV, this research also discusses 
possible approaches to examine how digital accessibility can 
be integrated into company-wide processes of multinational 
enterprises. 
The research process required the following research 
hypotheses: 
H1: Companies need to integrate digital accessibility into 
their processes to meet their social, economic and legal 
responsibilities. 
H2: The integration of digital accessibility into 
administrative and management processes in companies has 
not yet been sufficiently researched. 
II. 
DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY AS A POLITICAL, LEGAL, 
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REQUIREMENT FOR MULTINATIONAL 
ENTERPRISES 
Ever since the ratification of the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(UNCRPD) [5], digital accessibility has been gaining in 
importance for public administration, businesses and society. 
The equal access to information and communications and 
electronic services is required in article 9 of the Convention 
[5]. After ratifying, the European Union performs a lot of 
activities regarding digital accessibility [6]. Directive (EU) 
2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
obliges all member states of the European Union, to 
incorporate the accessibility of the websites and mobile 
applications of their public sector bodies within their national 
legal systems. These new legislative changes have created a 
growing market for accessible digital products and services 
for public bodies, which may be an opportunity or a risk for 
market participants, depending on their ability to design their 
products and services accessible [7]. Due to the entry into 
force of EU Directive 2019/882 (European Accessibility Act) 
and the resulting national legislative changes, digital products 
that are seen as important by the European Union, have to be 
designed in a way that they are usable by all people [8].

Therefore, companies that manufacture such products, will 
also have to face increasing accessibility requirements within 
the next years. The European Disability Forum also regards 
companies and market surveillance authorities as important 
key players for enforcement of the European Accessibility Act 
[9]. However not only companies that are obliged by law 
should act with accessibility in mind: the role of business 
enterprises has changed during the last decades and the 
concept of Corporate Social Responsibility has become 
increasingly important [10]. While in the past, the goal of 
corporations has been solely profit maximization, nowadays 
companies are expected to have a positive impact on society 
and to consider social and environmental impacts in their 
business decisions [11]. Furthermore, by acting with 
Corporate Social Responsibility in mind, companies can 
benefit on many different areas [12]. Recognizing this value, 
a Corporate Social Responsibility strategy is implemented in 
many large and medium-sized companies [13]. As one aspect 
of Corporate Social Responsibility, digital accessibility can 
bring a lot of advantages, for example by driving innovation 
or by enhancing company's brand [14]. 
III. 
DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY AS A COMPANY-WIDE 
PROCESS 
Many sources discuss the political, social, and economic 
importance of digital accessibility and the problems in 
achieving the accessibility goals [2] [15]. A number of 
guidelines for developers and disability advocates is set out 
[1] [4] [16]. While the technical requirements for digital 
accessibility of products have been extensively researched [4] 
[17], only few guidelines for companies exist on how digital 
accessibility can be integrated into a company's processes at 
the organizational level [10]. As the integration of digital 
accessibility into a company affects almost all parts of the 
organization, managers play an important role in adapting the 
processes and building an accessibility culture [18] [19] [20] 
[21].  
These literature-based findings demonstrate a research gap 
on how companies may draw on political, organisational, and 
technical framework conditions in designing accessible digital 
products and services. 
IV. 
HOW CAN THE INTEGRATION OF DIGITAL 
ACCESSIBILITY INTO MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES’ 
PROCESSES BE EXAMINED? 
The following paragraph provides some possible solutions 
to approach the topic. First, it describes some existing models, 
which may be adapted to investigate the maturity of digital 
accessibility in multinational enterprises. Next, it introduces 
useful concepts that may be helpful within this research 
project. 
A. 
Existing approaches 
The conducted literature review found two maturity 
models, which can help organisations to assess their digital 
accessibility programs [22] [23]. Both models assess the 
digital accessibility along different dimensions (e.g., 
communication, employees training), where accessibility can 
improve conformance with accessibility regulations. The 
models suggest measures, which can increase the accessibility 
performance. Maturity models are helpful in determining the 
status quo of a problem situation, but leave unanswered the 
question of how the capabilities needed to be solved can be 
identified and successfully applied [24]. In the case of digital 
accessibility, the existing models could be added with 
guidelines about how to identify the relevant knowledge, 
assimilate it, and apply it within the organization [25] [26]. 
Thus, depending on the branch and organization, the 
adoption of digital accessibility is influenced by different 
political, legal, social, and economic factors that may prevent 
or facilitate the implementation [1] [2]. For the successful 
integration of digital accessibility into a company’s processes, 
these factors need to be identified and appropriately 
addressed. 
B. 
Possibilities for further research  
To close the gap shown above, the authors suggest the 
following research direction as one possible approach: 
1) Soft 
Systems 
Methodology 
as 
methodological 
umbrella  
Further research might be conducted under the umbrella 
of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). The SSM provides 
structured guidelines to address social interventions to bring 
in change to the real-world affairs in a holistic, focused, 
systematic, and controlled approach. It also offers ways of 
examining a problem-situation, as both a ‘social system’ and 
a ‘political system’ [27] that might be useful to accommodate 
technological action. It emphasises explanation through 
learning rather than predictive testing by positioning the 
problem-situation within both the structural and cultural 
organizational 
contexts 
pursuing 
hermeneutical 
and 
phenomenological views i.e., a subjectivist perspective.  
As a learning methodology, SSM aims at finding relevant 
views and choices to the situation. In this investigation, the 
conceptual model will be used as a source of debate about 
potential change providing the questions to ask concerning 
the existing situation [27]. 
2) Identifying capabilities by using Absorptive Capacity 
To examine, which capabilities companies need to 
integrate digital accessibility, Absorptive Capacity might be 
helpful. Cohen and Levinthal [25] define absorptive capacity 
as the ability of the organization to recognize the value of 
external information, assimilate it, and apply it [25]. 
Moreover, Eisenhardt and Martin [28] consider that new 
competencies and abilities might originate on knowledge 
created, extended [28], and modified by absorptive capacity 
(ACAP) as a dynamic capability [26].  
These researchers also suggest the division of ACAP into 
Potential Absorptive Capacity (PACAP) and Realised 
Absorptive 
Capacity 
(RACAP). 
Furthermore, 
social 
integration mechanisms overcome the barriers between 
PACAP and RACAP [26]. 
3) Using Corporate Social Responsibility for grouping 
social aspects 
To examine the social dimensions of the integration of 
digital accessibility into the administrative processes, it may

be helpful to examine, how digital accessibility could be 
integrated into company’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
Strategy. Even there is no generally accepted definition of 
CSR [29] [30] [31] [32], many scholars deal with the CSR 
pyramid, shown in Figure 1, first published by Archie Carroll.  
Carroll’s four-part definition of CSR was originally given as 
follows: “Corporate social responsibility encompasses the 
economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary (philanthropic) 
expectations that society has of organizations at a given point 
in time” [30].  
Regarding digital accessibility, the four components of the 
pyramid may be relevant as follows:  
• 
The economic responsibility of a firm is about 
producing goods and services that society needs and 
making profit on them, taking into account all other 
layers of the pyramid. In the case of digital 
accessibility, companies might adapt their production 
processes to meet accessibility requirements, being 
profitable at the same time.  
• 
Legal responsibility refers to the company’s 
obligation to meet legal requirements and regulations. 
Regarding digital accessibility, companies are 
obliged to meet EU regulations and the resulting 
national regulations to not risk fines, sanctions, or 
business restrictions.  
• 
Ethical responsibility: Nowadays society expects 
companies to act in an ethical manner. For example, 
building a digital accessibility and inclusive culture 
may enhance a company’s branch and improve the 
company’s image.  
• 
Philanthropic responsibility concerns social activities 
beyond the expectation of society. Firms may support 
superior digital accessibility that goes further than 
legal requirements and the expectations of society.

CSR. Adapted from [30]. 
4) Society 5.0 as a model for an inclusive future 
In addition, the United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development which consider 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [33]. These should 
guide the effort of all nations working together towards a 
sustainable world targeting both economic development and 
solutions to societal issues by responding to the challenges 
with inclusiveness, i.e., “leaving no one behind” [34] [35].  
As shown by Maliszewska-Nienartowicz [15], accessibility 
is also strongly linked with the goals formulated in the UN 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
Society 5.0 is aligned with the principles of SDGs of the 
UN by offering a new growth model with a view of “solving 
social issues” as well as “creating a better future” [36]. The 
“Investment for the Future Strategy 2017” represents a 
commitment of the Japanese government aiming at building 
a society in which all citizens, including people with 
disabilities can lead a fulfilling life and demonstrate their 
abilities to the full by the introduction of digital technologies 
through Society 5.0 [36]. These moves both merge with the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (UNCRPD) [5], which marks the kick from 
digital accessibility. Since then, it has been gaining 
importance for public administration. 
5) Stakeholders as fundamental players for any 
successful digital accessibility program 
Since the company-wide implementation of digital 
accessibility is an overarching process, it is influenced by 
several stakeholders with many different roles and objectives 
[2] [37]. Therefore, stakeholder analysis is essential for 
further research. In a wide sense, stakeholders might be 
defined as “groups who can affect the achievement of the 
firm’s objectives” [37]. As one important group of 
stakeholders, the shareholders perspective is seen as 
particularly relevant for examining the topic. Shareholders 
theory assumes that managers are expected to use financial 
and human resources only in a way that is authorized by 
shareholders [38]. 
For developing a digital accessibility culture, it is 
therefore important to convince the shareholders to offer 
enough budget for the digital accessibility program and to 
support digital accessibility activities [39], to fulfill the 
company’s economic responsibility (see Carroll’s pyramid of 
CSR [30]). 
V. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
As shown in this article, the ratification of the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities has led to activities worldwide to increase 
(digital) accessibility. Within the European Union, digital 
accessibility has become an important element within the 
sustainability development strategy and has led to legislative 
changes that oblige public bodies and many companies to 
comply with digital accessibility criteria. Furthermore, there 
is a change of mind in society about topics, such as inclusion 
and accessibility; and the roles of companies has changed in

recent years accordingly. Concepts such as Society 5.0 and 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
have 
thus 
become 
increasingly important. While technical criteria for creating 
accessibility are well researched and partly regulated by law, 
this article shows a research gap regarding the integration of 
digital accessibility into the management practices and 
processes of companies. To close this gap, the authors 
propose an approach under the guidance of Soft Systems 
Methodology. Absorptive Capacity could be used to identify 
and apply the knowledge required, to implement digital 
accessibility within the companies’ processes. Existing 
accessibility models could be adapted and supplemented with 
perspectives from different target groups and concepts, such 
as Corporate Social Responsibility and Society 5.0.
