Abstract— In this paper an in depth study is made on 
identifying primary factors on which the Indian online 
shoppers are influenced. Based on the dominating factors 
extracted from the internet shoppers’ replies they are 
clustered. A novel and efficient single layer nonlinear ANN 
model with PSO based weight adaptation (SNANNP) is 
developed by taking the demographic input of the shopper and 
clustering results as the desired class. Close observation of 
experimental results indicate that the proposed method 
exhibits superior classification performance compared to that 
obtained by discriminant analysis and conventional single 
layer ANN (SNANN) model.

INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, internet marketing has gained popularity. 
The competition among the retailers have increased due to 
introduction of several online services. The literature survey 
reveals that nearly 67% shoppers use internet and half of 
them do shopping online. The advantages for choosing 
online shopping are: reduction in the cost by employing less 
manpower, saving of shopping time, less fear of loss of 
money in online shopping, increase in the bargaining power 
of shoppers, increase of rivalry among the competitors and 
improvement in security and ease of delivery. 
Gradually the interest towards online shopping is 
increasing during last few years. The consumers mostly 
prefer online services to purchase air/railway tickets, movie 
tickets, consumer electronic goods, audio/video files, 
software packages like an operating system, web browser, 
audio/video player etc. Usually the Indian consumers 
discuss with their friends and relatives before buying a 
product. 
The neural network has been used to classify consumers 
in choosing hospitals and marketing implications [1]. This 
model is also useful for market strategy planning. In another 
paper [2], a new approach has been proposed for direct 
marketers targeting potential consumers new to their 
categories. It is reported that the ANN model provides 
improved classification accuracy. A recent study [3] deals 
with conjoint analysis to create health plans that optimize 
value for consumers. 
A systematic study is made in this paper to group the 
consumers based upon their online shopping behaviour. The 
choice of people to prefer a service is diverse. A 
questionnaire was made on internet shopping based upon 
which 14 variables pertaining to the theme are chosen. 
Considering the correlation between the variables these are 
reduced into a number of factors. Using loading of the 
factors internet shoppers are grouped into clusters. Each 
cluster represents group of consumers with similar 
behaviour. 
The consumers are then identified into number of classes 
depending on the demographic attributes such as age, 
gender, level of education, amount spent on shopping and 
amount spent on online shopping. The results of the cluster 
analysis is used as the training class of the classification 
model. Three types of classification methods such as 
discriminant analysis, single layer nonlinear artificial neural 
network(SNANN) and single layer ANN with PSO based 
training are used. The rest of the paper is organized as 
follows : 
Section II develops a unique intelligent single layer 
nonlinear ANN model used for consumer classification. The 
basic of particle swarm optimization algorithm is outlined in 
Section III. Section IV deals with issues relating to data 
collection and data reduction using factor analysis. Cluster 
analysis for consumer grouping is dealt within Section V. 
The classification operation using discriminate analysis, 
SNANN and SNANNP models is carried out in Section VI. 
The results obtained from simulation studies are also 
presented and discussed in the same section. Finally Section

II. 
SINGLE LAYER NONLINEAR ANN(SNANN) CLASSIFIER 
The SNANN possesses the simplicity of single layer 
ANN and performance capability multilayer ANN. Hence it 
is chosen here to develop an efficient adaptive classifier. 
The enhanced performance is achieved by introducing 
nonlinearity through trigonometric functional expansion [6].

III PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (PSO)FOR TRAINING 
OF CLASSIFIER WEIGHTS 
 
    The PSO is a simple but efficient population based swarm 
intelligence based optimization algorithm. The PSO 
algorithm emulates swarm behavior and each particle 
represents a point in the D-dimensional solution space. The 
swarm, a collection of particles, initially contains a 
population of random solutions. Each particle is given a 
random velocity to fly through the problem space. Each 
particle keeps track of its previous best position, called 
pbest and its fitness value. Each swarm remembers its best 
position called gbest . The velocity 
vi (d)
 and the position 
xi (d)
 of the d th dimension of ith particle are adapted [4]-

IV DATA COLLECTION AND FEATURE REDUCTION 
 
(a)Data collection  
   The data is collected through a questionnaire from Indian 
online shoppers. Each answer is weighted in a 5 point-scale 
in which ‗1‘ indicates ―strongly disagree‖ and ‗5‘ indicates 
―strongly agree‖. 
   The questionnaire comprises of 5 sections. First section 
contains 5 questions. In sections 2, 3 and 4, 14 variables are 
used. The last section deals with the questions related to the

demography of the consumers. Demographic attributes 
include age, gender, education, average amount spent on 
shopping and average amount spent on online shopping. A 
total of 163 complete data are collected each having 14 
variables excluding the demographic variables. The 14 
variables used are listed in Table 1.

(b)Data reduction using factor analysis  
   Factor Analysis [7] is a statistical tool to find 
interrelationships between the variables. This is a technique 
through which the prominent factors hidden in the data are 
extracted. This is essentially a data reduction method used 
to reduce a set of observed variables to a set of latent 
variables. 
   This analysis is an ideal method for extracting factors. 
There are several methods to decide how many factors has 
to be extracted. The most widely used method for 
determining the number of principal factors is based on 
eigen value consideration [8]. In the present study five 
factors influencing consumer behavior are obtained using 
factor analysis. The eigen values, percentage of variance 
and cumulative percentage of variance of five prominent 
variables obtained from factor analysis are listed in Table 2. 
The factor loadings obtained are provided in Table 3. 
 
V. 
CLUSTER ANALYSIS 
Clustering mainly groups unlabeled datasets. It is an 
unsupervised classification technique. Mainly two types of 
clustering 
techniques 
are 
used 
: 
hierarchical 
and 
partitioning/ non-hierarchical [9]. Each one has its own 
merits/demerits depending on the applications in which it is 
used. In this study hierarchical clustering is chosen because 
it is suitable when the number of possible clusters are not 
known apriori. Cosine distance is used as the similarity 
measure to evaluate the closeness among the data points. 
The dendrogram of the factor scores computed is shown in 
Fig.2. 
   The dendrogram shows that the entire data are grouped 
into three clusters. It is found that 41, 67 and 55 online 
shoppers belong to clusters 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The 
factor scores with major contribution to each cluster are 
shown in Table 4. The demographic variables of the 
consumers in each cluster are listed in Table 5.

VI. 
CONSUMER CLASSIFICATION 
 
Clustered online shoppers need to be classified. The 
classification is based upon their behavior towards online 
shopping. The demographic attributes of the consumers are 
used as the inputs to the classifier. The results obtained from 
the cluster analysis are used as the training class for the 
classifier. The SNANN, SNANNP as well as discriminate 
classifiers are employed to classify these consumers. 
 
(a)Discriminant analysis based classification 
     Discriminant analysis is employed to classify the objects 
into various groups. This is a supervised classification 
technique [10, 11] in which the dependent variable is the 
class/group and the independent variables are the 
features/attributes. In this, a number of discriminate

20 percent isused for testing the performance. The 
classification results obtained from the tests are shown in 
Table 6. 
 
(b)SNANN based classification 
     In this model the input signal x(k) represents the five 
demographic data of the online shoppers, each of which is 
expanded to three trigonometric terms. These are then fed to 
the SNANN model. The three outputs obtained from the 
model using (4) are compared with those obtained from the 
cluster analysis to produce error signal

    The training rule for updating the weights of the proposed 
SNANNP model is outlined in the following steps: 
1.The model is provided with K input patterns each 
consisting of five demographic features of the consumers. 
Each feature is expanded to three trigonometric terms and

2. Each new term is multiplied with the corresponding 
weight and then summed to give an output and in this way 
K numbers of estimated outputs are computed.  
3. Each desired output is compared with the corresponding 
model output and K errors are produced.  
4. The mean square error (MSE) (corresponding to nth 
particle) is determined by using the relation defined in (11). 
This is repeated for M times, where M is the number of 
particles. 
5. Since the objective is to minimize MSE (n), n = 1 to M 
the PSO based optimization method is used. 
6. The velocity and position of each particle is updated 
using (8) and (9). 
7. For each iteration the minimum MSE, MMSE is stored 
which indicate the learning efficiency of adaptive model. 
8. When the MMSE reaches the pre-specified value the 
optimization process is stopped

DISCUSSION 
Five key factors are obtained from fourteen variables 
selected based on eigen values greater than one. The factor  
scores obtained are used in the cluster analysis. Clustering, 
operation provides 41, 67and 55 consumers in clusters 1, 2 
and 3 respectively. From Table 4 it is observed that cluster 1 
is heavily loaded by the factor 2. So all the consumers 
seeking website design belong to cluster 1. Cluster 1 
represents website design. Factor1 load heavily on cluster 
2.Consumers who are particular about privacy and security 
belong to cluster 2 and hence is named as privacy and 
security. Factors which load heavily on cluster 3 are factors 
3, 4 and 5. In this cluster the consumers are interested in 
ease, enjoyment, communication and norms. So cluster 3 is 
named as ease, enjoyment, communication and norms. The 
statistics of the demography of the consumers are listed in 
Table 5. 
The accuracy classification for three classifiers using 
demographic features as inputs are shown in the Tables 6, 7, 
and 8. The comparative results of the three classifiers are 
listed in Table 9.

The results presented in Table 9 demonstrate that the 
SNANNP model provides best classification performance 
compared to those obtained by other two methods. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a novel method has been proposed for 
classification of Indian consumers based on their behavior 
towards online shopping. The factor analysis is carried out 
on the data to achieve reduced number of factors. The 
hierarchical based clustering is used to group the consumers. 
Three different classifiers : discriminant analysis, SNANN 
and SNANNP are used for classification. The simulation 
results indicate that the proposed SNANNP based model 
provides best classification performance compared to its 
statistical counterpart. The proposed research can also be 
extended for classification of other real life data. The 
classification accuracy can further be enhanced by adding 
physcographic and cultural inputs to the proposed classifier.
