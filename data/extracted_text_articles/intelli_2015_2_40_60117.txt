Abstract—Deep Web is growing rapidly with multitude of devices
and rendering capabilities. Despite the richness of Deep Web
forms, their rendering methodology is very poor in terms of
capacity of expression. Hence, the user has no indication about
the richness of the query and the query capability when he
interprets this interface. In this paper, we propose a new
rendering approach of Deep Web forms which is easy to interpret
by the user and reflects the exact meaning of the query. We have
evaluated our algorithm on standard dataset and compared it to
a well known state of the art algorithm. Our approach showed
good performance with respect to standard measures.

INTRODUCTION
Deep Web is the part of the Web which is not reachable via
hyperlinks [2][4][7][12][14][15]. It is hidden behind Web
forms which give access to Deep Web databases. Information
on databases is a really big treasure. More than 90% of the
information from the Web comes from Deep Web. In addition,
this information is very rich in terms of quality of service
offered to internet users [12][13][14]. We aim by our job to
reveal the Deep Web to novice internet users via new, simple,
and easy-to-use Web forms.
A Web form is an information retrieval interface which
give access to Deep Web data. It is a graphical representation
of the query using a set of fields. Users form their query by
visual interpretation of the meaning of the query interface. The
design method of the Web form [1][3][5][6][10][11] is very
important since it is the only source of inspiration for novice
users in order to understand the meaning of the query. A bad
interpretation leads to an incorrect query and hence restricts
access to Deep Web services. In this paper, we focus on the
design aspect of Web forms in order to offer to novice users
easy- to-use forms.
In the Web form presented in Fig. 1.(a), we notice presence
of white fields crossing the Web form horizontally. These
fields are very important; they indicate the presence of
semantic entities (or semantic concepts).A novice user may not
pay attention to these fields.
We present below the relevance of the white fields.
Let us consider an example in which the user is not
interested in non-stop flights but is searching for a flight with
one stop to reach the destination. Suppose the user is searching
for all flights having as destination ‘’Tunis’’ offered by an
airline company with one stop city. The user may give by
mistake the destination city and the number of passengers and
leave the departure city empty. This request will be wrong
unless the user knows all stop cities for destination ‘’Tunis’’.
This is not evident and will be a burden for a novice user as he
must formulate as many queries as there are stop cities.
In this paper, we present a new design methodology which
simplifies the design of the Deep Web form. While our
methodology preserves the query capability of the Web form, it
removes the complexity of the query with an easy-to-use form
containing all necessary and pertinent fields. The resulting
form becomes very simple and, more importantly, semantically
very rich.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents a brief review of related works. Section III explains
the motivation of our new approach G-form. In Section IV, we
detail the principle of the G-Form and our experiments will be
presented in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
According to the literature, Z-form [9] is considered as the
most used form in the Deep Web. Z-Form is a flat query
where all fields are listed at the same level of granularity. The
name Z-Form comes from the fact that the user reads Z-Form
like reading lines in a paragraph: he begins by the first line,
then the second, etc. This reading strategy resembles to the
letter Z (see Figure 1.b).

Z-Forms are the most used information retrieval query
interface on the Web. Despite their reputation, Z-Forms have
drawbacks. The first drawback is that all fields are rendered in
the same interface. When the number of fields is large, the
query becomes very complex and novice users find it difficult
to formulate a correct query. We have seen that a line segment
covers an entire line and forms hence one semantic entity of
fields. However in many cases, more than one semantic entity
may appear in one line. The Z-geometric pattern does not
detect all semantic entities in the line, but considers the entire
line as one semantic entity.
Ko-Chiu [20] proposes a new approach for effective surfing
in the visualized interface of a digital library. This interface is
designed
for
novice
users
(children).They
found
that
information retrieval seeking of novice users is influenced by
their curiosity and hindrance. Ko-Chiu studies the interactions
and the usability of various search interfaces, and the
enjoyment or uncertainty experienced by children when using
virtual game-like interface. When novice users search for
information, they have specific directions but they do not have
a specific search target. These novice users have no special
training or beliefs regarding search strategies. A visual
interface based on the navigation experience is used to help
users build mind maps. This interface stimulates curiosity of
novice users in order to enhance the information retrieval
experience.
III. AFFINITIES BETWEEN DEEP WEB AND
GALAXY
G-Form is a Deep Web form which is inspired by the
concept of a “galaxy. First, we will present the affinities
between a galaxy and a Deep Web form, then we explain the
way galaxy-form is build.

Hypothesis :
Novice users regard deep web form like they regard cosmic
universe.
Stars are fields and a galaxy is one semantic group of
fields. When novice users consider the Deep Web form, they
move from one semantic entity to another entity just as an
astronaut moves from one planet to another or from one galaxy
to another in the cosmic universe. If distance is a measure of
this cosmic travel, pertinence is the measure of relevance
between fields. The center of mass of one galaxy is equivalent
to the mean average pertinence of one semantic entity. Sub-
sections A and B detail the similarity between a Deep Web
form and the galaxy.
A.
Web forms
Deep Web forms organize fields respecting a hierarchical
schema (see Figure 2). This schema gives the query its
meaning. In our previous work [18] we have presented an
algorithm, called VIQI (Visual Interpretation of Deep Web
Query Interfaces), which is able to extract the hierarchical
schema from Z-Form. Figure 2 gives the resulting output of our
algorithm when applied to the query interface (left).
The hierarchical schema (see Figure 2) detects the presence
of 4 groups: Departure={Leaving From, Going To}, Number
of Passengers={Adults, Children, Infants}, Departure Date
={Day of Departure, Month of Departure}, and Returning
Date={Returning Day, Returning Month}, and 10 fields:
Leaving From, Going To, Adults, Children, Infants, Day of
Departure, Month of Departure, Returning Day, Returning
Month, and Flight Class) and one super group :root.
As we have mentioned before, the hierarchical aspect of the
Deep Web form indicates the presence of semantic relations
between entities which are “is-a” and “part-of”’. For this
reason, we measure the pertinence of one galaxy of fields as
the
center
of
mass
of
the
galaxy.

Figure 2. Deep Web form and its hierarchical scheme
Another important aspect in Deep Web forms is degree of
pertinence of fields (see red numbers below schema elements
of Figure 2). In G-Form, fields are organized according to their
pertinence. The most relevant fields are rendered before fields
with less pertinence: the most relevant fields are placed on the
top left of the Web form, while fields with less pertinence are
placed right most on the bottom of the Web form. Hence the
field “Adults” is more pertinent than the field “Infants”
(pertinence decreases from left to right) and also more pertinent
than the field
“Children”. And field “Going From” is more
pertinent than “Flight Class” (pertinence decreases from top to
down) as by default users choose economic class while they
must mention where they are going in order to formulate a
correct query.
The degree of pertinence in G-Form corresponds exactly to
the depth first search (DFS) traversal of schema elements. DFS
identifies the order of visiting of the schema elements. In
Figure 3, we have indicated under each schema element its
degree of pertinence. We remark that I < J if element I is
rendered before element J in the Web form (on the left). And
DegreeOfPertinence(I) > DegreeOfPertinence(J).
This way, we can measure the relative relevance degree of
a group of fields forming one semantic entity. Suppose D is
the mean average pertinence degree of a group of fields and r is
the distance between the relevance degree of a field and the
degree of pertinence of fields group:
if D/ r >ε, then field is relevant in the group
if D/r < ε then field is not relevant
B.
Galaxy
Planets in universe are structured according to hierarchical
schema like G-Forms. Planets belong to galaxies and there is
also super-galaxies grouping a set of galaxies. When we regard
the sky by night we observe thousands of brilliant stars (see
Figure 3). In reality, each brilliant point is not only a star, but
may be another galaxy. As the distance between the observer
and galaxy is very large light coming from the galaxy appears
like a single point.
We present an example. Let us consider Andaman galaxy,
situated at distance r from Earth and having dimension D (see
Figure 3) as one point wherever in space as Earth is far away
from Andaman galaxy. Andaman galaxy is observed as a single
point situated in the center of mass of the galaxy, and has as
mass the total mass of the entire galaxy.
In mathematics, quotient D/r is:
of Centerof massrelativeto Earth

If quotient D/r is very small, we can replace the sum of all
stars of galaxy Andaman by only one term situated in the
center of mass.
if D/r > ε then star is observed from the galaxy
if D/r <ε then star is observed as a single point
Figure 4 shows planet Earth (on the left) and Andaman
galaxy (on the right). The square on the bottom shows a zoom
on Andaman galaxy. First, it is clear that, according to an
observer inside Andaman galaxy, our galaxy Milky Way may
be approximated by a mass point situated at the center of mass.
In the galaxy Andaman (or Milky Way) itself, this geometric
picture repeats, as indicated in Figure 4. While the quotient
D1/r1 is very small, stars situated at the smallest box can be
replaced by their center of mass.

IV. PROPOSED APPROACH: G-FORM
We propose a new approach for visual interpretation of
Deep Web forms. The interpretation of the form is based on the
hierarchical schema (see Section 3.A) inspired from galaxy.
We choose to use a hierarchical representation of the query
instead of a flat representation as this representation is richer
according to the semantics of the query. The principle of our
approach is explained in the following algorithm.
The first Web form is rendered as Z-Form of stars where
all fields are stars. When the user clicks on a star, we consider
that the user moves to the galaxy containing the field. Our
algorithm determines the immediate pertinent fields in the
galaxy. A field is considered as pertinent if it is not far from the
center of mass (clicked field) of the galaxy: its degree of
pertinence is under ε distance, fixed by the user, from the
clicked field.
In Table 2, we show which pertinent fields are rendered
when the user clicks on a star in Figure 6.(a). For example, let
us take ε fixed to 1:
-
If the user clicks the field with degree of pertinence
equal to 3, then only fields “Leaving From” (with
pertinence degree 3) and “Going To” (with pertinence
degree 4) are rendered,
as they are situated under
distance inferior or

If the user clicks a field with pertinence 7, then only
fields “Adults”, “Children”, and “Infants” are rendered
as they are situated under distance 1 from field
“Children” (clicked field) having degree of pertinence
equal to 7 (see Figure 5.c).
In Table 2, the rows correspond to the clicked star and
columns correspond to the rendered fields. According to Table
2, we remark that the rendered fields depend on the clicked
field because, when the user clicks a star, we consider that the
observer moves to the galaxy of this star. Hence, only stars at
quotient D/r
> ε (see Section 4.B) are observed from this
galaxy and all the others are observed as brilliant stars.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Our approach renders the query according to its semantic
representation (schema of the query). We have tested the
performance of G-Form on a standard dataset ICQ [19]. ICQ
is a collection of query interfaces collected from the Deep
Web services. For each query interface, its manually extracted
query schema is available on dataset. Interfaces are collected
into five classes of subjects: Airfare, Automobile, Books, Real
estate, and Jobs.
Our evaluation methodology is as follows. We build G-
Form for every schema of Web form available on the dataset.
Then, we build Table 2 which simulates the user clicks on
different stars in the Web form. Then, we count the number of
correct entities (group, super-group of fields). An entity is
considered as correct if it is semantically coherent. For
example entity {Adults, Children, Infants} is a correct entity
as it describes the number of passengers. While entity {Time,
Adults, Children} is not correct because Date of flight and
Number of passengers overlap.
We count for each G-Form number of extracted entities,
number of extracted entities which are correct, and then we
measure precision, recall, and F1 of the algorithm.

Figures 6, 7, and 8 show that our approach performs with better
results on the domain of interest ‘’Auto’’. The ‘’Auto’’ domain
contains flat queries, i.e fields are organized at the same level.
Choosing a good ε coefficient makes the visual representation
of the query very easy.
Our approach allows to achieve 73% of recall for
‘’Airfare’’ domain. Queries in this domain are hierarchical with
many levels. Choosing a small ε coefficient renders the
concepts in the “Airfare” domain as small galaxy composed of
2 or 3 fields.

Figures 6, 7 and 8 summarize the results shown in Table
4. We notice that, with regard to all measures, the two curves
corresponding to the two approaches follow the same pace.
This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the process
of rendering of fields is based on the query schema which is
common to the two approaches. However, Figures 6, 7 and 8
show that the performance of our approach is always superior
to the performance of Z-Form. Our approach attends its
maximum precision for ‘’Airfare’’ domain as queries in this
domain are hierarchical and well adapted to rendering the
strategy of our algorithm.

The coefficient ε is an indicator of the complexity of the
query. For small values of ε, only a small group of fields are
rendered; the other groups are rendered as stars. This is the
case of the ‘’Airfare’’ domain, which is considered as the most
complicated domain. For a large coefficient ε, a large group of
fields are rendered and interpretation is close to Z-Form. This
is the case of the “Book” domain, which is formed with flat
queries. The complexity measure of the query can be shown for
epsilon 3: “Airfare” is the most complex, ”Book” is relatively
more complex than airfare, and “Auto” is the simplest query.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed a method to solve the
complexity of queries in Deep Web forms. We proposed a
new design approach G-Form inspired from the concept of a
galaxy. It offer to novice users easy-to-use Deep Web forms
and reveals clearly the exact meaning of the query even if its
schema is complex. There is a strong analogy between the
concept of a galaxy and Deep Web form with respect to
structure and granularity of entities in each concept.
G-Form is better than Z-Form, which is a well known state
of the art algorithm. Z-Form lacks design expressivity because
there is no background concerning the semantic value of the
query, while our approach is based on a hierarchical schema,
which reveals clearly the semantic of the query. Our approach
clearly has better performance than Z-Form with respect to
precision, recall, and F1 measures of performance.
