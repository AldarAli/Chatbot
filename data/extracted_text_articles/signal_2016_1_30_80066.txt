Gaussian filtering in multiscale image decompositions for 
texture retrieval. Using energy-based retrieval framework on 
Vistex database, conducted experiments on five multiscale 
transforms (contourlets, wavelets and their redundant 
counterparts), show the competitive enhancement provided by

 INTRODUCTION  
 
Retrieving image data from large scale databases lead to 
great challenging issues in the research field of content-based 
image retrieval (CBIR). A special attention is given to 
texture retrieval because of the omnipresence of this visual 
feature in most real-world images [1]. Textures are 
prominent in natural images (as in grasslands, brick walls, 
fabrics, biological tissues, etc.) and many important image 
properties are revealed through texture analysis such as 
granularity, smoothness, coarseness, periodicity, geometric 
structure, orientation and so on [2]. Therefore, texture 
retrieval is relevant to CBIR since texture characteristics are 
powerful in discriminating between images. Successful 
texture retrieval relies strongly on relevant texture feature 
extraction and effective similarity measurement steps 
yielding to high image retrieval accuracy while preserving 
low level of computational complexity.  
There are renowned methodologies for texture feature 
extraction operating in the spatial domain (e.g., gray level 
co-occurrence matrices), in the frequency domain (e.g., 
Fourier spectrum measurements), or in the spatial-frequency 
domain (e.g., energy of wavelet coefficients) [1].  
Spatial-frequency transforms, also known as multiscale 
representations, decompose the image spectrum into a set of 
localized frequency-partitions exhibiting image details at 
multiple scales and directions. Linear filter banks and down-
sampling operators are the main tools to perform such 
decompositions yielding various image representations with 
specific properties such as multiple scales, frequency 
selectivity, directionality, redundancy or compactness, 
perfect reconstruction and shift invariance. The redundancy 
property is directly related to the amount of oversampling at 
the decomposition stage. Non-subsampled decompositions 
are known to be completely redundant and shift invariant.  
Examples of multiscale transforms include discrete wavelets, 
Laplacian pyramids and contourlets.  
Recent studies have reported the achievement of 
remarkable outcomes due to the development of a variety of 
new texture feature extraction techniques operating on these 
multiscale representations [3][4][5]. This probably was 
motivated by two main facts: a) the human visual system 
adequacy to the spatial-frequency representation of image 
signals, and b) the inherent nature of texture patterns in terms 
of presence of edges, relation between primitive texture 
elements and variation in scales and orientations [1][ 2]. 
The major contribution of this paper is to study and 
reveal the benefits of incorporating redundancy and 
Gaussian filtering in multiscale image transforms for texture 
feature extraction and retrieval. The remainder of this paper 
is organized as follows. Section II recalls the main 
properties of discrete wavelet, discrete contourlet and their 
redundant variants that are subject to exploration in this 
work. A special focus is made on redundancy properties.  
Section III details the incorporated feature extraction 
methods and the texture retrieval framework. Section IV 
discusses experimental results and main achievements while 
Section V concludes the paper.  
 
 
II. 
MULTISCALE TEXTURE REPRESENTATION 
A. Discrete wavelets and stationary wavelet transforms  
The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is efficiently 
implemented by means of iterative linear filtering and 
critical down-sampling of the original image yielding three 
high-frequency sub-bands at each scale level in addition to 
one low-frequency sub-band usually known as image 
approximation. The DWT provides a highly compact image 
representation, that is, the transform is orthogonal, and 
incorporated down-sampling rates result into a total number 
of wavelet coefficients equal to the image size. Since its 
development, the DWT gave rise to many renowned 
methods and techniques in various fields of image 
processing and particularly in image compression. However, 
its use for texture analysis has revealed some limitations in 
11

capturing relevant information. In fact, major drawbacks 
were reported in many studies; lack of shift invariance, poor 
frequency 
selectivity 
and 
poor 
directionality 
(only 
horizontal, vertical and diagonal orientations).  
The stationary wavelet transform (SWT) has been 
introduced as an improved extension of the DWT. This non-
subsampled variant is implemented through the so-called 
"algorithme à trous" in French (word trous translates into 
holes in English). The SWT achieves shift invariance 
property at the cost of substantial redundancy of wavelet 
coefficients. Indeed, the L-level SWT representation of a 
K×M image results into one approximation sub-band and 3L 
detail sub-bands. Thus, total number of wavelet coefficients 
is equal to (3L+1)KM. 
B. Standard contourlet transform(SCT) 
The discrete contourlet transform as introduced in [6] is 
designated here as the standard contourlet transform (SCT). 
Multi-Directionality, non-separable 2-D filtering and small 
amount of redundancy are among the new ingredients in this 
geometric transform. The decomposition is performed with 
high computational efficiency by combining two distinct 
stages. First, a multiscale decomposition uses a Laplacian 
pyramid (LP) scheme to transform the image into one coarse 
version plus a set of Laplacian sub-images. Second, a 
directional stage (DFB) applies iteratively 2-D filtering 
(DFB) and critical subsampling to further partition each LP 
sub-band into different and flexible numbers of frequency 
wedge-shaped 
sub-bands, 
thus 
capturing 
geometric 
structures and directional information in natural images.  
When compared to the DWT, the SCT with its extra 
feature of directionality is almost critically sampled with a 
small redundancy factor up to 4/3 due to the Laplacian 
pyramid. SCT leads to efficient representation of smooth 
object boundaries with a small number of local coefficients 
in the right directional sub-bands.  
 
C. Nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) 
NSCT is a non-subsampled variant of the SCT [7]. All 
down-sampling 
operations 
are 
di 
carded 
from 
decomposition stages thus eliminating aliasing problems 
and allowing for full shift-invariance. However, major 
drawback lies in the rapid increase of computational cost as 
large number of directional sub-bands are generated.  For 
example, the NSCT of a K×M image with 3 scale levels and 
4 directions per level results into one approximation sub-
band and 3×4 directional sub-bands. Thus, total number of 
wavelet coefficients is equal to 13KM since each sub-band 
size is the same as original image size.  
D. Redundant contourlet transform (RCT) 
The redundant contourlet transform (RCT) has been 
introduced in [8][9]. The RCT variant aims at reducing 
aliasing problems in SCT by discarding sub-sampling 
operations and allowing for more redundancy in the 
multiscale decomposition scheme (see Fig. 1). 
 
Figure 1.  RCT block diagram (3 scale levels) and its frequency partition. 
Down-sampling is discarded from the Laplacian stage. 
As for the standard contourlet transform, the RCT 
decomposition scheme is divided into two parts: a 
multiscale decomposition and a directional filter bank 
(DFB) using two-dimensional filtering and critical down-
sampling. While DFB stage is kept unchanged, the 
multiscale stage is replaced by a redundant Laplacian 
pyramid (RLP) construct using a set of linear phase low-
pass filters with pseudo-Gaussian properties. Filter impulse 
responses hb(n) are given in (1) where increasing values of 
the factor b decreases the filter passband:

 L filters (with b=2l, l=1… L) may be used to build a 
pyramid having L+1 equal-size sub-images: L detail sub-
image and one coarse image approximation CL. Then, a 
DFB with D=4 orientations and 1:4 critical down-sampling 
is applied on each of the RLP sub-bands to obtain 4L equal-
size directional sub-bands {Cld; l = 1… L; d = 1… D}. 
Thus, the redundancy factor for the RCT is L+1 since each 
RLP sub-band size is the same as original image size.   
 
III. 
TEXTURE FEATURE EXTRACTION AND RETRIEVAL 
Multiscale energy-based approach for texture feature 
extraction consists in calculating energy (L1 norm, L2 norm 
or some combination of both) and characterizing its 
distribution through multiscale sub-band images. The 
energy-based approach assumes that different texture

patterns have different energy distribution in the space-
frequency domain. This approach is very appealing due to 
its low computational complexity involving mainly the 
calculation of first and second order moments of sub-bands 
coefficients [3]. Given a multiscale decomposition yielding 
L scale levels and D directional sub-bands Cld at each level, 
two feature vectors E1 and E2 are formed as follow:

Similarity measurement is computed as the Euclidean 
distance between two compared feature vectors. 
 
Given a database with P images, a visual index is 
constructed by computing, for each image, its feature vector 
E1 (or E2) as described in (2)-(7). Retrieving similar images 
to the user query Q is done through the calculation of M 
Euclidean distances between the query feature vector and 
the visual index features. The N smallest distances in a 
ranked order are then selected as Top-N matches and 
corresponding images are retrieved.   
 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
To evaluate the impact of added redundancy and pseudo-
Gaussian filtering on the performance of texture retrieval, 
we conducted experiments using VisTex database [10]. We 
selected 40 grayscale images from various texture categories 
(as shown in Fig. 2). Each image of size 512×512 is 
subdivided into 16 overlapping sub-images of size 256×256, 
and thus, a database with 640 sub-images is constructed. To 
avoid any trivial discrimination based on local mean and 
variance, we normalized grayscale values to zero mean and 
unit variance. Texture retrieval performance is measured in 
terms of the retrieval rate (%), which is calculated as the 
percentage of relevant images found among the Top-N 
retrieved images (with N=15). 
All retrieval results presented in this paper are obtained 
by averaging the retrieval rates corresponding to 640 
queries. We compared five distinct multiscale transforms 
combined to two distinct texture retrieval frameworks using 
energy E1 and energy E2 features, respectively. The 
implemented multiscale decompositions are as follow: 
 
1. DWT: Discrete Wavelet Transform using 4-tap 
Daubechies filters; 
2. SWT: Stationary Wavelet Transform using 4-tap 
Daubechies filters; 
3. SCT: Standard Contourlet Transform, with pkva 
filters,  yielding 4 directional sub-bands at each 
scale level; 
4. NSCT: Non Subsampled Contourlet Transform, 
with pkva filters,  yielding 4 directional sub-bands 
at each scale level; 
5. RCT: Redundant Contourlet Transform, with 
pseudo-Gaussian and pkva filters, yielding 4 
directional sub-bands at each scale level. 
 
Average retrieval rates (%) obtained by each of the 
compared methods are given in Table I. In most cases, 
feature extraction using energy E2 gives slightly better 
results than energy E1. Retrieval is performed with different 
combinations of scale levels. Each additional scale level 
increases the performance of the retrieval rate. Top results 
correspond to 3 scale levels as shown in Table I. The worst 
retrieval rates are obtained from wavelet-based retrieval 
(DWT and SWT). This is probably due to the poor 
directional selectivity of these transforms. We can clearly 
observe that retrieval rates improve as transform redundancy 
increases, i.e., SWT leads to better rates than DWT, and 
NSCT rates are better than SCT ones. However, despite the 
fact that RCT has a partial redundancy; it yields the best 
texture retrieval performance (about 3 points higher) thanks 
to pseudo-Gaussian filters in the Laplacian pyramid stage 
(see Table II).  
The benefit from pseudo-Gaussian filtering is also 
illustrated in Table III. Indeed, texture retrieval is performed 
on Laplacian sub-bands, namely, NSCTLap and RCTLap 
that correspond to the multiscale pyramid stage of NSCT 
and RCT respectively. Two observations may be drawn 
from this experiment: 1) retrieval rates are substantially 
lower than in Table I due to the lack of directional 
selectivity in the Laplacian decomposition, and 2) 
performance of RCTLap is better than NSCTLap thanks to 
pseudo-Gaussian filters, which allow for good texture 
discrimination.  
We believe that, despite the simplicity of the energy-
based model for feature extraction, all these successful 
results in texture retrieval rates have manifested the 
potential of added redundancy and Gaussian filtering, 
through RCT, in extracting discriminant texture features.

CONCLUSION 
 
The quality of texture retrieval is subject to effective 
image representation and relevant feature extraction that 
discriminate among different textures. In this paper, we 
successfully demonstrated the positive impact of image 
transform redundancy and Gaussian filtering on the 
efficiency of retrieval rates. Moreover, the conducted 
experiments using multiscale energy-based feature vectors 
have shown the superiority of the redundant contourlet 
transform (RCT) for texture discrimination and retrieval, in 
comparison to other multiscale transforms, namely DWT, 
SWT, SCT and NSCT. Subsequent ongoing research 
directions focus on rotation invariance of such multiscale 
retrieval schemes.
