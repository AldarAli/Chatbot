Abstract— In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, the
various types of IoT devices, from tiny and lightweight devices
to powerful smart devices, are connected to send and receive
information to and from each other. We need to define
different security requirements of IoT devices, depending on
the functionality, capabilities, and characteristics. In this
paper, we analyze security threats and vulnerabilities of IoT
devices, and propose the security requirements based on
classification of IoT device capabilities.
Keywords-IoT; security; classification.

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of IoT market, security threats and
vulnerabilities of IoT devices, having a variety of types and
performance, are increased by being interconnected with the
network. Therefore, IoT devices need to be provided with
various security features for responding to security threats
such as hacking and exploitation. Most existing IoT devices
are available for the CPU and memory resources are limited,
such as lightweight devices, so low-power and lightweight
security mechanism are essential. In addition, IoT devices
should be able to prevent malfunction or stop due to the
malicious code, and should be able to prevent information
leakage from physical theft or loss.
In
this
paper,
we
analyze
security
threats
and
vulnerabilities of various IoT devices, and propose security
requirements in order to prevent confidentiality, integrity and
availability,
for
example,
access
control,
device
authentication, data integrity, anti-virus, secure storage,
security updates, and so on. Also, we classify IoT devices
into four categories depending on their capabilities and
propose security requirements for each class of IoT devices.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives an overview of related work and provides a discussion
of our contribution. Section III describes security threats
analysis and security requirements of IoT devices. Section
IV proposes security requirements based on classification of
IoT device capabilities, followed by conclusion in Section V.

RELATED WORK
IoT devices can be classified according to various criteria.
They can be classified by functionality and type [1],
classified based on the type of data handled [2], and
classified according to the degree of resource constraint [3].
Many researches have been performed for the security
function
required
of
such
IoT
devices
[4][5][6]
and
classification mechanism for IoT devices to determine their
capability to support security mechanisms of different
degrees [7].

The openness of IoT platform accelerates interworking
between heterogeneous devices, and the variety of security
threats
is
increasing.
In
addition,
three
elements
of
information
security
which
consist
of
confidentiality,
integrity, and availability are increasing the possibility of
infringement. From these threats, we present the security
requirements to keep the IoT devices safe.
A.

devices
should
encrypt
sensitive data such as private information and
cryptographic key, and securely process and store
these data to prevent information leakage.
•
[Tamper resistance] IoT devices should provide
tamper resistance function to ensure the safety and
reliability from physical attacks.
•
[Device ID management] IoT device should have
unique device identification information and safely
handled so as not to leak outside or to change
illegally.
B.
Integrity
•
[Data integrity] IoT device should provide data
integrity verification function to prevent forgery of
data.
•
[Platform integrity] IoT devices should provide
platform integrity verification function of system-
level such as firmware and operating system.
•
[Secure booting] When power is first introduced to
the device, IoT devices should provide secure
booting function to ensure the reliability of the
device through authenticity and integrity of the
software on the device.
C.
Availability
•
[Logging] IoT device should provide the appropriate
log function for the user, the system, the security
event.
•
[State Information Transmission] IoT device should
provide a periodic keep-alive message or device
state
information
transmission
function
for
prevention from physical removal/destruction and
abnormal installation attempt.
•

IV.
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS BASED ON
CLASSIFICATION OF IOT DEVICE CAPABILITIES
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) classified
into four different types of IoT devices according to type and
functionality as follows: data-carrying device, data-capturing
device, sensing and actuating device, and general device [1].
In this paper, however, we classify IoT devices in four
classes, depending on their capabilities.
Class 0 devices are very constrained devices, such as
compact, lightweight, and low-power sensors. Due to the
constrained in memory and processing capability, they do
14

not participate in Internet communication in a secure way.
These devices usually communicate with the help of proxies
or gateways.
Because
of
constrained
resource
and
processing
capabilities, Class 1 devices cannot easily communicate with
other devices employing a full protocol stack, such as
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transport Layer
Security (TLS). They use a protocol stack for specifically
designed
for
IoT
device
with
constraints,
such
as
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Device examples
include a blood glucose meter or a thermostat that is based
on 8-bit or 16-bit processors. It is possible to communicate
with other devices without the help of a gateway.

Class 2 devices can be supported in the existing
communication protocol stack, or that are less constrained.
Examples include an IP camera or a smart meter that is based
on 32-bit processors. However, these devices also can benefit
from using low-power and lightweight protocol, and from
consuming less bandwidth.
Class 3 device example is a smartphone or a tablet
beyond class 2. They can use existing protocols without any
changes or modifications. However, these devices can still be
constrained by a limited power supply.
Table II presents the security requirements according to
IoT device classification. It can be easily utilized as a
security guideline to apply to various IoT devices.
V.
CONCLUSION
IoT devices are always exposed to security threats, such
as loss or theft, information leakage, and data forgery. In this
paper, we analyzed security threats and vulnerabilities for
IoT devices, and proposed security requirements based on
classification of IoT device capabilities. By presenting with
the applicable security requirements in the various classes of
IoT devices, we are expected to contribute to improving
security of IoT devices.
