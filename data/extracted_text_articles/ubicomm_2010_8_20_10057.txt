Abstract—Wireless tour guides are mobile applications 
running on a PDA that are very popular among cultural 
environments, such as museums and art exhibitions. The 
Human-Computer Interaction quality derived from the use of 
these guides heavily depends on the wireless network used to 
access the information of the artefacts in the cultural 
environment. This work presents a procedure to evaluate the 
Wi-Fi network performance used by a tour guide system. The 
procedure is applied to a real museum in Spain. The procedure 
is based on a set of observation and measurements performed 
in measurement points distributed across the cultural 
environment. It also presents how to analyse the coverage of 
the wireless network, the set of environmental factors that may 
degrade the performance of the network and the effectiveness 
of the access point selection algorithm used by the mobile 
device. As result of the evaluation, we have identified a set of 
weak points in the network development. However, they were 
not relevant enough to alter the actual network deployment.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Museum guides have evolved through the time. 
Traditional approaches, such as text panels next to art pieces 
and triptychs, have serious limitations. For instance, the 
physical space that is available to support multi-language 
information. Besides, the maintenance costs on this media 
are high due to information reprinting in time-limited 
exhibitions. 
In order to solve these problems, alternatives such as 
audio guides, supported by cassette players or solid memory 
devices, or radio frequency technologies emerged providing 
visitors with individual access to information. Main 
disadvantage of these approaches is the limitation to provide 
audio information only. 
Although Web technologies offered new opportunities to 
open up the walls of the museum to the world [1], the 
information was not offered in-situ. 
Thus, the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) emerged as a 
powerful tool to provide multimedia information in-situ, 
providing applications that served as multimedia guides for 
cultural environments visitors. A comparative evaluation of 
different platforms for augmenting museums and art galleries 
where the PDA proved to be a successful information 
provider for visitors is presented in [2]. Additionally, 
according to [3], the PDA has also been accepted as a good 
approach to face this problem. 
Although there are tour guides for indoor and outdoor 
environments, such as the exposed in [4], we will focus on 
guides for indoor environments.  
The infrastructure to develop tour guides for indoor 
environments varies according to how the information is 
retrieved. 
On the one hand, the standalone approach proposes the 
information retrieval from the PDA device memory [5, 6]. 
On the other hand, the client-server approach proposes 
storing information on a central server and the retrieval is 
achieved from the clients (PDAs) through a wireless network 
connection [7]. 
The standalone approach has some advantages such as: 
(a) the lack of networking infrastructure, and (b) the server 
storing the information to be exposed to visitors. However, 
the client-server approach has also some valuable advantages 
compared to the standalone approach. In a client-server 
approach, 
the 
cultural 
environment 
information 
is 
centralized; therefore when it changes, it is automatically 
propagated to the clients. Besides, the client-server does not 
restrict the use of the guide to those devices that are provided 
by the cultural environment because it can be easily 
deployed on visitor devices (it only requires a tiny the client 
application to be downloaded). Under this scenario, the 
communication network becomes a key factor of the tour 
guide application because from the human-computer 
interaction perspective, the user experience depends on the 
capabilities of the wireless network to retrieve multimedia 
information.  
This paper proposes an evaluation procedure for wireless 
communication networks employed to deliver information 
from the tour guide content server to the tour guide clients 
within the cultural environment. 
The evaluation procedure is performed on a tour guide 
deployed in a real museum the Cutlery Museum of Albacete 
(MCA) in Albacete, Spain. The goal of the system is to 
provide visitors with multimedia information about the 
knives exposed in the building through a PDA device 
running the tour guide application.

RELATED WORK 
The evaluation of the wireless network is close related to 
the environment in which it is deployed. In this case, we 
expose an indoor environment represented by a cultural 
environment in which a wireless guide is deployed. 
As we have mentioned in Section I, the wireless network 
that was evaluated was the Cutlery Museum of Albacete 
(MCA) in Albacete, Spain [7].  
However, it is not the only wireless guide for cultural 
environments. There are some other interesting approaches 
that exploit this technology; for instance, mi-Guide [8] or the 
location aware system exposed in [9]. 
Thus, this paper proposes a guideline that can be used to 
evaluate the deployment of wireless networks following a 
defined procedure that takes into account the physical 
environment, the measurement process and the data analysis. 
III. 
THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 
The first step of the evaluation procedure is the analysis 
of the physical environment. 
In the MCA, the physical environment where the system 
was deployed is defined by a two floor building. The ground 
floor and the first floor plans are depicted in Fig. 1 (a) and 
Fig. 1 (b). 
The surface of each floor is about 200 m2, external walls 
are 40 cm width, internal walls are about 25 cm width and 
the floor is tiled. 
Floor rooms are identified by the “R” prefix. Rooms R1 
to R6 belong to the ground floor, and rooms R7 to R11 
belong to the first floor. The walls of the rooms are bare, 
except for R7 (in the first floor) that has wood-panelled 
walls.  
Rooms also contain showcases where pieces are exposed. 
They are all wooden-made, but those that are in R10 that are 
made of stainless steel.  
The Fig. 1 (a) and the Fig. 1 (b) show the distribution of 
showcases, wireless access points (C1, C4, A9 and B3) and 
measurement points (X1 - X25) through the building. 
Note that the ground floor is connected to the first floor 
by a stainless steel elevator and a marble stair. 
IV. 
THE WIRELESS TOUR GUIDE SYSTEM 
Before introducing the measurement process, we expose 
in this section the hardware and software architecture to the 
system. This information is relevant to the evaluation process 
in order to specify the type of systems we are dealing with. 
A. System architecture 
The system is based on the traditional client-server 
architecture depicted in Fig. 2. 
The server side of the application is composed by the 
Web server and the Database server. Each server is defined 
as a two-node cluster to improve system reliability.

Server machines are equipped with Pentium IV 2GHz 
processors with 512 MB of RAM Memory and two 100 
Mbps Ethernet interfaces.  
One of them is used for data synchronization between 
cluster nodes, and the other one is used to connect the cluster 
to the information system. 
While the communication between database and Web 
servers is wired with UTP cable for 100Mb, the 
communication between the Web server and mobile clients 
is conducted by a wireless network (802.11b). Transport and 
communication protocols are TCP/IP in both cases. 
In order to cover the whole building, we have installed 
five wireless access points that supports 802.11b at 2.4 GHz.  
Besides, to reduce the network traffic and the processing 
overhead in the PDA client, no encryption was enabled in the 
system. 
The client side of the application is composed by two 
types of clients: the Content Manager and the Tour Guide. 
The Content Manager is designed as a “What You See Is 
What You Get” (WYSWYG) application to manage the 
information of to be provided to visitors. On the other hand, 
the Tour Guide is designed as a PDA based application that 
runs on a PDA. 
Each PDA is equipped with a 400 MHz processor, 64 Mb 
of SDRAM, 64 Mb of ROM flash memory, the QVGA TFT 
colour screen is 3.5 inches long and has a 320 x 240 
resolution on 65,536 colours. Communication protocol is 
limited to 802.11b. 
B. The Client Application 
This section exposes the client application to provide 
readers with a conceptual idea of the wireless network load. 
A full description of the application is exposed in [7] and 
a usability evaluation following the CIF (Common Industry 
Format for Usability Reports) standard defined by the 
ISO/IEC DTR 9126-4 is presented in [10]. 
The Adobe Flash technology was used to provide visitors 
with a high quality user interface. This interface provides 
visitors with the ability to explore the museum in several 
ways: (a) guided tour, (b) recommended routes, (c) through 
the finder and (d) unguided tour. 
Independently of the museum exploration mode, the 
application provides information of floors, rooms, showcases 
and pieces. The Fig. 3 shows tour guide user interface. 
All screens are stored locally by the device. However, the 
content showcase and piece related resource are retrieved 
from the Web server. The key screen, from the network 
information load point of view is the piece resource viewer.  
Through this interface the user is able to retrieve text, 
images, audio and video information. 
C. The Characteristics of theIinformation 
The image file format used by the application resurces is 
JPG, the resolution is 800 px x 600 px and the file size varies 
from 5.72 KB up to 81.1KB (avg. 43.41 KB).  
The audio file format used is MP3 at 22 KHz and 32 
Kbps of bit rate; file size varies from 129 KB up to 370 KB 
(avg. 249.5 KB). The video video file format used is WMV, 
the video resolution is 352 x 288 at 368 kbps; the video and 
audio codec are WMV3 and two channel WMA2 at 22Khz 
and 32 kbps of bit rate respectively; file size is about 5 Mb. 
V. 
THE  MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE 
Once, we have analysed the environment and system 
characteristics, we proceed with the measurement procedure. 
Thus, this section exposes the measurement procedure that 
was employed to carry out the evaluation of the MCA 
wireless network to be used as a guide for further 
procedures. 
The software employed was the PDA’s default software 
to show access point information. It provides the signal 
strength (S), the signal noise (N) and the S/N ratio for each 
access point that is at range. It also provides the access point 
the device is connected to. 
The measurement process was carried out in two phases 
achieving two independent measurements following the 
same route. The route is defined as a sequence of points 
where the measurement is performed. The order of the 
sequence is defined by the order of the X nodes (see Fig. 1 
and Fig. 2). Measurement results are exposed in Table I and 
Table II.

A. The Signal Coverage in the Building 
In order to evaluate the signal coverage in the building 
we use the signal-noise ratio as the reference parameter. 
Thus, the equation (1) defines the fr function that takes a 
measurement point xi and an access point pj as parameters to 
return the signal/noise ratio from pj at xi. The M constant 
defines the total amount of measurement points and the A 
constant defines the total amount of access points. 
 
fr (xi, pj), i  [1…M]  j  [1…A]
 
The RMAX and RMIN values, exposed by the equations 
defined in (2), represent the maximum and the minimum 
signal/noise ratio that have been measured during both 
measurement phases.

(2) 
 
i, k  [1…M]  j, l  [1…A] 
 
Finally, (3) defines gr (fr (xi, pj)) that returns 1 if pj covers 
xi, or 0 otherwise. 
 
r = fr (xi, pj); RLIM = (RMAX – RMIN)/2 
 
 
gr (r) = 1 r  [RLIM…RMAX]

gr (r) = 0 r  [RLIM…RMAX] 
 
The application of the equations on measurement results 
is represented by the Fig. 4 (a). It shows the signal/noise 
ratio from the “best” access point on each measurement 
point. It also depicts the RMAX, RMIN and the RLIM values. The 
main reason for being below RLIM may be related to: (a) 
interference because of environmental conditions or (b) the 
algorithm used to select the access point the device connects 
to. To solve this question, we analyse these parameters in 
next subsections. 
From Fig. 4 (a), we may also conclude that although in 
both phases the coverage was not complete, the wireless 
network is able to fulfil this requirement because if the best 
access points would have been selected the 100 % of 
measurements points would have been covered. 
B. Environmental factors 
This section analyses the environmental factors, such as 
interference generators, that may degrade the link quality. 
The first parameter to analyse is the noise as reference 
parameter. 
The problem will be discussed at two levels.  On the one 
hand, the first level studies the environmental noise in the 
building. On the other hand, the second level studies the set 
of particular situations that we have revealed on previous 
section. 
1) The Environmental Noise. In order to study the 
environmental noise, we base our analysis in the noise level 
through the building. These levels are depicted in Fig. 4 (b). 
Thus, the equation (4) defines the  function that takes a 
measurement point xi and an access point pj as parameters to 
return the signal noise at xi from the pj. Once noise function 
was defined, we apply (5) to obtain the Xm= -91.32 dB and 
the Sx = 1.19 dB. These values show that noise levels are 
stable. 
 
fn (xi, pj), i  [1…M]  j  [1…A] 
(4) 
 
Xm = (Σ fn (xi, pj))/NSx = (Σ fn (xi, pj)) - Xm)2/N; N=i·j (5) 
Some Particular situations. Once we have analysed the 
environment as a whole, we continue with the analysis on 
problematic measurement points. First, we will analyse X2, 
X23, X24 and X25 from the first phase. Focusing on X2 in 
Fig. 1 (a) we can see that it is in the middle of two access 
points (C4 and BE). The most suitable is BE (see Table II). 
However, the C4 was chosen, even when BE was previously 
chosen (X1). The most reasonable explanation is the visitor 
orientation, coming from X1 the device may have pointed to 
C4 instead of BE. However, there is an argument to be 
discussed before closing this case. The question is related to 
Phase II access point selection (BE) for the same 
measurement point. The explanation is related to the access 
point selection algorithm that according to our observations 
follows this procedure: an access point is selected only if no 
access point was selected or the connection to actual access 
point is lost. Thus, on the one hand, in the first phase the 
connection with BE was lost while the visitor was pointing 
to C4. On the other hand, in the second phase, the connection 
was not lost, so no selection was made at all. The group 
composed by X23, X24 and X25 measurement points is 
attached to A9 instead of BE (C1 is discarded because these 
measurement points are in the ground floor and C1 is 
between the ceiling and the roof at first floor). In contrast to 
the previous case, it seems not to be the orientation of the 
visitor that affects the selection of the optimal access point 
(BE). Instead, it may be related to the access point selection 
algorithm described on previous paragraph. Once first phase 
analysis was performed, we analyse the X6, X16, X17 and 
X18 measurement points of second phase. The measurement 
point X6 is affected by the elevator that is made up stainless 
steel. The elevator was up when the measurement was taken, 
fading the signal. Another factor that has affected X6 is the 
change of the access point used by the mobile device from 
A9 to C4. It should have been provoked by the way up from 
ground floor to first floor through the stairs. Finally, another 
consequence of the change of access point mobile device 
from A9 to C4 is the low measurement at X16, X17 and 
X18.  
2) The Access Point Selection Algorithm. From the 
analysis performed on both phase measurements, we have 
identified the following problems: (a) visitor orientation, (b) 
physical interference (i.e. elevator) and (c) the access point 
selection algorithm (change of access point connection). It is 
really difficult to control the first two problems, because 
they are not directly related to hardware or software. 
However, the access point selection algorithm deserves an 
extra analysis to propose future improvements on it. The 
results of the analisys expose that on the first phase, the 54 
% of the access point selected by the device is coincident to 
the best possible. On the second phase of measurements, the 
62 % of the access point selected by the device is coincident 
to the best possible. It proves that the access point selection 
algorithm should be improved in order to leverage the 
wireless network performance.

According to the study of building coverage we have 
performed, a new algorithm may leverage the signal-noise 
ratio to reach an optimal 100 %. Therefore, the performance 
may reach an average improvement of 41.67 %. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This article proposes a procedure to evaluate the 
capabilities of wireless networks used by tour guides in 
cultural environments. It also applies the procedure to a real 
product deployed at the MCA in Albacete, Spain. It starts 
evaluating the signal coverage in the building and the 
environmental interference. As result of the analysis of these 
two parameters, the mobile device access point selection 
algorithm is evaluated conducting to the conclusion that an 
average improvement of 41.67 % may be achieved in the 
access point selection if the selection algorithm properly 
modified. 
The future work is focused on three main research lines. 
The first one is related to how to improve the algorithm. We 
are actually exploring different ways to do it that goes from 
pooling to the application of prediction algorithms. On the 
second research line we are trying to use new mobile device 
features such as accelerometers and gyroscopes that could be 
used to acquire information from visitor movements. And 
finally, we are doing some research on how new 
technologies affect the wireless network capabilities. An 
example of new technology applied to this field is the use of 
RFID technology in both variants: passive and active, as 
presented in [11].
