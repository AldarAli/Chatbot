Abstract—Application of multi-touch screen interfaces is 
desired by manufacturers of measuring instruments to follow 
the current trend of consumer products. This study is a first 
approach to determine the influence of screen location and 
orientation on upper limb movements and posture. Neck and 
wrist posture, as well as finger movements and subjective 
perception of discomfort were evaluated in simple tasks 
simulating the placement and scaling of objects using a multi-
touch interface placed on a computer screen of the same size. 
The results show that wrist and neck postures are generally 
affected by an interaction between screen height and 
inclination. They also suggest that precision requirements 
associated with measuring instruments may not be compatible 
with simple transfer of manipulation methods from consumer 
products.

 INTRODUCTION 
Natural user Interface technologies based on 
multi-touch displays have been successfully 
implemented in a variety of consumer devices.  
This success has lead to the adoption of these 
technologies for work applications. However, 
most work instruments are designed to sit on a 
bench or cart, have vertically mounted screens and 
may require precise manipulations.  Gestures such 
as the “pinch”, used to zoom in and out, may 
require awkward wrist and upper limb postures 
when performed on a vertically mounted screen. 
Posture and repetition are known risk factors [1-3] 
commonly associated with localized muscle 
fatigue [4-6] and upper limb musculoskeletal 
disorders [7-8]. Furthermore, movement precision 
required to set specific values of gesture-
controlled functions may increase repetition and 
muscle co-contraction activities. Hence, simply 
using the methods designed for mobile devices on 
vertically mounted screens may create rather than 
solve problems.   
The present study investigated the influence of 
screen height (elevation) and inclination (relative 
to the vertical direction) on wrist posture and 
finger movements during object manipulation 
tasks using simple natural gestures. The level of 
required precision varied between tasks.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Participants 
Ten right-handed young adults aged 20-31 
years (5 males, 5 females) participated in the 
experiment as volunteers. All were free from 
upper limb neurological and musculoskeletal 
disorders 
that 
might 
have 
impaired 
their 
performance. Their visual acuity was 20/20 or 
better, with or without correction. 
B. Experimental setup and conditions 
An instrument screen was simulated on a 
computer screen, onto which a matched size multi-
touch screen was adapted. LED markers were 
placed on the thumb and index fingers, the wrist, 
elbow and shoulder of the right limb and head to 
record their movements with an active motion 
capture system (Optotrack™). The participants 
were facing the screen seated on a comfortable 
office chair adjusted to their anthropometry to 
obtain a 90° knee angle with feet flat on the 
ground. Three screen heights (1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 
seated height- measured to the bottom of the 
screen) combined with three screen inclinations 
(10, 15, 20° relative to the vertical direction) were 
tested in random order. The tasks to be performed 
simulated 
real 
instrument 
operations. 
They 
included adjusting both the vertical and horizontal 
position of an object, scaling the horizontal and 
vertical dimensions of the object to specified 
values and switching the primary object to be

manipulated. Numerical values and grid scales 
were displayed on the screen.  
C. Procedure 
The duration of each of the five tasks varied 
between 30 s and 2 min. A brief 10-20 s rest 
separated two consecutive tasks.  A longer 2 min 
rest was provided between conditions while the 
experimenter adjusted the screen. Between trials, 
participants were allowed to relax their arm on the 
arm rest and between conditions they could stand 
or move away from the work station. The motion 
signals associated with each marker were sampled 
at 100Hz. 
D. Measures 
Discomfort was evaluated on a category scale 
(0= no discomfort, 1= barely perceptible, …, 
5 = extreme pain) for each of the following body 
parts: finger, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, back).  
The magnitude of selected angular displacements 
(wrist 
flexion-extension; 
wrist 
pronation-
supination; neck flexion-extension) and thumb-
index finger “pinch” opening indicated by the 
maximum distance between the respective finger 
tips distance were computed from the recorded 
motion of the respective markers. Observations by 
the experimenter about task execution and 
comments from participants were recorded for 
each experiment for association with quantitative 
data 
III. RESULTS 
A. Discomfort rating 
No major discomfort or fatigue was reported in 
the context of our experiment. Ratings were rather 
low; however neck and shoulder discomforts were 
higher for the 20° screen inclination and were also 
generally higher for the highest screen elevation. 
The average peak discomfort corresponded to a 
value of 2 on the 0-5 scale and discomfort tended 
to increase with the chronologic order of 
experimental conditions. 
B. Wrist, head and finger movements 
Wrist extension increased primarily with screen 
verticality (low inclination), as illustrated in Fig.1. 
The order of screen height indicates that wrist 
extension tend to be affected also by screen 
elevation. However, a higher elevation may reduce 
wrist extension induced by screen inclination, as 
indicated by a significant elevation-inclination 
interaction.

elevation and inclination). 
 
Wrist rotation tended to increase primarily as a 
function of screen height, as illustrated in Fig.2.

Neck flexion seems to be higher for the lower 
screen inclinations (more vertical), particularly for 
the lower screen elevation as illustrated in Fig.3.

movement patterns did not appear to be associated 
with specific experimental conditions (Fig.4). 
Further more, task duration and thus movement 
repetition increased significantly (up to 5 fold) 
when position and scaling precision were required.

experimental conditions. 
C. Survey 
Comments from the participants indicated that 
object 
placement 
and 
size 
scaling 
were 
very/extremely difficult to achieve when high 
precision was required (100% of participants). In 
addition, a delay between finger movements and 
object movements, as well as parallax associated 
with the distance (although only a few mm) 
between the touch screen and computer screen 
were frequently cited (70% of participants) as 
factors affecting performance.  
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The results indicate that discomfort was not an 
issue in the context of our experiment; however, 
the influence of screen elevation and inclination on 
wrist posture was significant and showed expected 
interactions. In addition, delay and the need for 
precise manipulation contribute to an increase in 
the number of movements necessary to complete 
the tasks. Furthermore, multi-touch operations, 
such as size adjustment, frequently required hand 
repositioning to re-initiate a gesture.  
Discomfort (or muscle fatigue) was moderate in 
the present context; however the tendency of 
discomfort to increase with time, as indicated by a 
sequential order effect suggests that prolonged 
“manipulations” may lead to the development of 
fatigue, even if finger forces required to move the 
fingers are very low [9].  In this experiment, the 
participants could rest their arm on the armrest at 
anytime. They could also use the bottom edge of 
the screen as a wrist support (1) in between tasks, 
(2) when manipulation of the object did not 
necessitate vertical displacement of the wrist, or 
(3) when inclination of the screen permitted such 
posture / use of support reaction forces. No 
specific instruction was provided; hence the 
participants adopted strategies associated with 
muscular effort minimization, as is the case in 
posture 
control 
[10]. 
However, 
these 
“support/anchoring” 
strategies 
are 
highly 
dependent on the availability of support and 
environmental context in which the instrument is 
used. Furthermore, the participants were not time 
constrained and benefited from rest periods while 
the screen position was adjusted for each 
condition.  
Not surprisingly, wrist extension and rotation 
were influenced by both screen elevation and 
inclination. In addition, it may be assumed that 
influences from task specificities are very likely 
since different gestures (finger movements) 
require wrist and arm coordination as a function of 
the direction of the movement. A more detailed 
analysis based on a larger number of repetitions 
for each task would be necessary to determine 
more precisely optimal screen location to 
minimize large deviations from neutral joint 
postures. Nevertheless, the present results indicate 
that touch screen manipulations on vertically 
mounted instruments may induce significant wrist 
deviations, which are considered a risk factor, 
especially when sustained or combined with high 
repetition [7]. Furthermore, repetition seems to be 
promoted by accuracy requirements, at least when 
simply duplicating manipulation methods used to 
operate hand held devices.  
 Variations in neck flexion with screen 
elevation and inclination have been associated 
with maintaining the line of sight in computer 
tasks [11-13]. However, in the present context, 
these variations may reflect an optimization of 
head orientation to improve visual guidance of 
hand movements [14]. 
Overall, postural adjustments seem to be driven 
by the environmental conditions and the manual 
task to be performed, which differ from classic 
visual capture of information from a video screen.
