Abstractâ€”Classification of ambiguous gene name synonyms is 
a necessity when mining PubMed Central records with gene-
related queries. This work introduces the use of word-vectors 
for gene name disambiguation. PubMed Central was queried 
for gene names and their synonyms. The retrieved records 
were filtered and automatically separated into train- and test-
data. A similarity threshold was derived from the similarity 
matrix of every training word-vector set. The classification 
performance of the word-vectors was compared to a gene 
name similarity classification. Both methods showed good 
results, but the word-vector classification was superior in 
terms of precision and recall.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Searching MEDLINE for information about genes is a 
common task. Retrieving results that are not related to the 
gene under consideration is a common experience. One 
reason is the existence of ambiguous gene name synonyms. 
Many gene name synonyms are shared by two or more 
genes. This means that a PubMed search for an ambiguous 
gene name synonym will retrieve the publications for at least 
two genes. If the search is performed by a scientist, he will 
be burdened by the additional workload to sort out the 
unwanted publications. Even worse, a data-mining tool, 
without the capability of recognizing the ambiguity, will 
confound the information for the gene under consideration 
with the information from the other gene. Problems with 
ambiguous gene names were already reported by Jenssen et 
al. [1], and were also the topic of the BioCreative 1 and 2 
challenges [2] [3]. Hakenberg et al. [4] and Wermter et al. 
[5] undertook huge efforts to normalize gene names. More 
recent approaches were published by Neves et al. [6] and by 
Li et al. [7]. The work presented here demonstrates a solution 
for the gene name disambiguation problem as it was 
described by Li et al. and Hakenberg et al. [8]. Our method 
solves the issue of ambiguous gene name synonyms by 
context similarity classification. In Section II the applied 
methods and the datasets are described. Section III gives a 
summary of the results for the classification of ambiguous 
PubMed records. The conclusions for the experiments and 
their results are given in Section IV. 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Gene names and synonyms 
Gene names and their synonyms were the starting point 
for our shared synonyms experiments. Two sources were 
used to retrieve the synonyms. A table with Human Genome 
Organization (HUGO) ids, gene names, approved symbols 
and 
synonyms 
was 
retrieved 
from 
HUGO 
Gene 
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [9]. The second source 
was the MEDLINE database Entrez Gene [10], which also 
delivered HUGO ids, gene names, and synonyms. Both these 
databases were used because they do not completely overlap. 
The combined database, LG, is a list of records for each 
gene. A single record lgGene from this list contains the 
approved symbol as the approved name and a list with all 
synonyms from the two data sources. A scheme for the 
complete algorithm is given in Fig. 1. 
B. Ambiguous synonyms detection 
The algorithm for detecting ambiguous synonyms 
consists of two parts. For the detection of ambiguous 
approved symbols, an approved symbol asGene,query from a 
gene record lgGene,query is taken and compared to the 
synonyms from all other records in LG. This is done for 
every approved symbol in LG. If the approved symbol 
asGene,query matches a synonym, an ambiguous approved 
symbol is found. Detecting ambiguous synonyms works 
analogously. From a record lgGene,query, a synonym squery is 
taken and compared to all other synonyms in LG. If squery 
matches any other synonym, an ambiguous synonym has 
been found. This is done for every synonym in LG. If a 
record lgGene,query contains an ambiguous approved symbol, 
ambiguous approved name or an ambiguous synonym the 
gene record receives the label ambiguous. 
C. Querying PubMed Central with gene name synonyms 
For all ambiguous records from LG, queries are 
generated to search the PubMed Central database. One 
PubMed query is created for every single approved symbol, 
approved 
name 
or 
synonym. 
Without 
any 
further 
specification, all fields in the PubMed Central database are 
searched. Depending on the query, no records at all up to 
several tens of thousands are retrieved.

The result is a dataset, RGene, for each gene, containing the 
retrieved records. If a PubMed record contains an 
unambiguous approved name or an unambiguous approved 
symbol it receives the label train. If the PubMed record 
contains only ambiguous gene name information, approved 
symbol, approved name or synonym, it receives the label 
ambiguous. PubMed queries with the Entrez tool did not 
distinguish between lower-case and upper-case letters. 
Unfortunately, many letter combinations exist which differ in 
capitalization 
and 
are 
shared 
by 
different 
terms. 
Consequently, up to tens of thousands of false-positive 
records were retrieved for a single gene.  
D. Whitelist filtering of PubMed records 
A post-processing step was added to get rid of the false-
positive records. If a synonym consisted of less than six 
characters and did not contain a space, the retrieved PubMed 
records were filtered for the exact upper- and lower-case 
pattern of the synonym. However, after this filtering process, 
many false-positive records still remained. These records 
contained terms with an identical synonym to the gene under 
consideration. False-positive records that contain the exact 
synonym can only be detected by analysing the context of 
the synonym. The context of the synonyms we were looking 
for was related to the concept 'gene'. For the record filter in 
G2DPubMedMiner, a gene context list of 25 terms was 
defined: 
activation, 
activator, 
allosteric, 
chromatin, 
chromosome, codon, exon, expression, gene, genome, 
genotype, histone, homolog, inhibitor, inhibition, intron, 
modulator, 
mutant, 
nucleosome, 
peptide, 
phenotype, 
phenotypic, polymerase, protein, target, transcript, and 
transposon. If a PubMed record did not contain any of these 
words, it was very unlikely that the record was related to a 
gene. Consequently, a PubMed record was only accepted if it 
contained at least one of the words from the context list. 
Furthermore all records were skipped that did not contain a 
disease MeSH term. 
E. Test dataset with ambiguous gene records 
From the list with the ambiguous genes a test dataset 
with eleven pairs of ambiguous gene records was selected at 
random (Table 1). A gene test set record gtrGene1,Gene2,Synonym 
contained two approved symbols and the ambiguous 
synonym they shared. For each gene test set record the 
corresponding train- and test-sets from PubMed Central were 
compiled. The training set contained all PubMed records 
where the approved gene name or the approved symbol was 
found. The test set contained the records with the ambiguous 
gene name synonym. All test records were manually 
classified and received the label genename1, genename2 or 
none. None was given if the text in the PubMed record 
summary indicated that the gene name synonym referred to 
neither of the two genes.

F. Classification of ambiguous records 
Two methods were used for the classification of the test 
records. A simple gene name similarity search was used as 
standard method. Word-vectors were used as a second 
classification method. A word-vector encodes a text as an 
integer vector. Every field in the vector corresponds to one 
word, and the field value is equal to the frequency count of 
the word in the text. Two word-vectors are compared by 
calculating their similarity coefficient. The method was 
adapted from Lewis et al. [11]. Because of their results, we 
decided to use the cosine similarity together with inverse-
document-frequency (IDF) weighting. We changed only 
their formula for the similarity calculation by multiplying x2

and y2 with IDFi (Eq. 1). Consequently, the similarity is 
scaled between zero and one: 
 
                  
.         1 
For a train data set, the complete similarity matrix was 
calculated. This means that all pair-wise similarities were 
calculated between the word-vectors that were compiled 
from the PubMed records for one gene. The similarity values 
were sorted and the value at a given percentile of the sorted 
vector was taken as threshold value. The classification of the 
test data was done for different percentile values: 0.75, 9.5, 
0.25, 0.05, and 0. A percentile of 0 meant that no threshold 
was used. 
III. 
RESULTS 
A total of 35,631 gene names were extracted from 
HUGO. The ambiguous synonyms detector found 7166 pairs 
of genes that shared at least one synonym. From this set of 
gene pairs, eleven were selected for the test dataset. The 
processing time for a dataset, including querying PubMed 
and the consequent processing of the results, strongly 
depended on the number of retrieved PubMed records and 
took up to 30 minutes. 
The results for the classification experiments are given in 
Table 2 with precision and recall as figures of merit.

In the last column of the table the harmonic mean combines 
precision and recall. For the simple approach with the gene 
name similarity classification a precision of 0.83 and a recall 
of 0.28 was reached. The next five rows show the results for 
the classification using word-vectors and the five different 
threshold percentiles. The maximum harmonic mean was 
reached for a threshold of 0.05 (WVSim 0.05). To compare 
our results with other approaches like those of Li at al. [7], or 
Xu at al. [12] et al. is difficult, because gene name 
normalization and disambiguation are often done together. 
Or, supervised methods are used, with the disadvantage of 
being successful only in the training domain. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Identification of more than 7,000 gene pairs sharing at 
least one synonym demonstrated that the classification of 
ambiguous gene names is a worthwhile undertaking. With a 
test data set, compiled from eleven pairs of ambiguous gene 
names, it was shown that word-vector classification reduced 
the ambiguity significantly. A similarity threshold value, 
which was automatically derived from the similarity matrix 
of the training data, increased the precision of the 
classification results. The entire process, starting with 
querying PubMed Central, followed by filtering and train- 
and test-set generation, and the classification is unsupervised 
and can be fully automated. Word-vector classification for 
gene name disambiguation is a valuable addition to every 
data-mining tool working on PubMed records with gene-
related queries.
