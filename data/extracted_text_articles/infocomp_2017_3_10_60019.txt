Abstract—This paper presents the research and results on
creating means for a comparative analysis of data entities
from knowledge resources. The research was started in order
to tackle the challenges of data analysis with increasing and
complex resources. Comparing data entities is a most ambitious
task for increasingly complex data objects, integrated resources,
and relations – from the knowledge resources, as well as
from the computational perspective. The implementation utilises
complementary components, which enable to structure and
describe complex knowledge and support an advanced analysis.
The paper presents practical examples and discusses the high
level view of an implementation and case study. For practical
reasons with the comparative analysis, the knowledge resources
utilise references to publicly available data resources. The goal
of this research is an advanced methodology and modular means
for comparative analysis and knowledge mining with information
systems and long-term multi-disciplinary knowledge resources.
Keywords–Knowledge Mining; Comparative Analysis; Content
Factor; Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation; Advanced Data-centric
Computing.

INTRODUCTION
Advanced methods of knowledge mining with information
systems and knowledge resources are becoming increasingly
important. With that, improving knowledge mining and at the
same time integrating larger amounts of data increases the
challenges. The core of challenges is the data analysis. Within
data analysis, comparing “data” is a central task. Comparing
data entities is an even more ambitious task when data objects
and relations are becoming more and more complex.
The term data entity in context with knowledge resources
refers to any data representing objects of any kind like digital
or realia objects, including references, e.g., to objects or
conceptual knowledge.
Within this research, special application components were
created and implemented in order to provide modular means
to be integrated for a comparative analysis, e.g., knowledge
resources referring to structured and unstructured data, concep-
tual data, especially knowledge classiﬁcation, and methodolo-
gies specialised on the before mentioned means, e.g., the Con-
tent Factor method (CONTFACT) [1]. The multi-disciplinary
knowledge resources and the application of the Content Factor
method have enabled new ﬂexible workﬂows and the creation
of new complementary means for both the enhancement of
multi-disciplinary knowledge resources and for data-centric
knowledge discovery processes [2]. Some of the most widely
required means with data entities of knowledge resources are
components for a comparative analysis. Comparative Analysis
(CA) is deﬁned as an item-by-item comparison of two or more
comparable entities.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II summarises
the state-of-the-art, motivation, and frame of reference to the
ground of comparison. Section III introduces the object and
data entities integration with different resources, and imple-
mented for this case study. Section IV provides the compu-
tation and analysis results based on the selected resources.
Section V discusses the main results and evaluates them in
context of the application. Section VI summarises the results
and lessons learned, conclusions, and future work.
II.
STATE-OF-THE-ART, MOTIVATION, AND FRAME
The elementary way of knowledge mining, practised by
the vast majority of approaches and services ignores content
quality, document types, and cognitive knowledge. That means,
content is handled independently from the creation process and
expertise, content from databases, Web pages, and scanned
books are not differentiated, and classiﬁcation of content is
disregarded.
CA modules can be used for arbitrary purposes with knowl-
edge mining workﬂows, e.g., for selecting complementary
resources as well as selecting objects supporting decision
making processes. The methodology is used with knowledge
mining workﬂows, integrating dedicated knowledge resources
and publicly available content, e.g., text documents and books,
because of their complementary nature regarding content,
structure, and quality. The following sections describe the
motivation and the base of the conducted CA.
A. Frame of reference
The signiﬁcance of integrating different data entities results
from the context, in which they are placed. This research
presents a methodology of comparing different data entities
as referred from objects in advanced knowledge resources.
Objects with higher quality are mostly more complex. Ad-
vanced knowledge mining and decision making requires more
than one methodology or algorithm for analysis of available
objects and their references, data entities, and attributes. A
major challenge is the difference of entities, e.g., regarding
entity type, original purpose of the entity, and source but also
content and structure.

Different types of entities cannot be ignored from advanced
workﬂows because they contain unique knowledge and infor-
mation. In most cases, the knowledge and information can even
only be provided by different entities and referred sources.
Methodologies should be provided, which are beneﬁcial to
be integrated in advanced workﬂows, especially for analysis,
quantisation, and qualiﬁcation of different entities. The de-
ployed means should allow long-term data-centric applications
and intrinsically foster the seamless integration with existing
workﬂows. In addition, the methodologies and architecture of
integration should allow the implementation of modular and
least invasive components.
B. Grounds for comparison
Besides the complexity, a combination of data entities
from different sources and different types was choosen for
the following reasons. The rationale behind the choice for
knowledge resources and entities from referred objects results
from complementary content and context. There is an arbitrary
high quality of multi-disciplinary content in the knowledge re-
sources, which are in continuous development [3]. In addition,
the knowledge resources can provide an extremely high knowl-
edge and information density. The Gutenberg resources [4] can
provide a large number of fully publicly available standard
text documents and elaborations for a wide multi-disciplinary
context. Both types of resources contain essential amounts of
textual content and are continuously extended and improved.
The relationship between different entities is the addressed
knowledge content with its unique nature. The thesis is, that
different entities should neither be left out from advanced
workﬂows nor should their content, the unique knowledge
and information, be ignored. The following lens comparison
discusses the most important aspects text-by-text, focussing on
advanced knowledge resources and referred resources.
III.
INTEGRATION OF RESOURCES
The following sections describe how an integration was
achieved and which results were gained with the analysis.
A. Data entities
Data entities can be created from many resources. With this
research, knowledge objects and data entities were automat-
ically created from ‘Gutenberg documents’. At the time of
the case study (January 2017) Project Gutenberg [4] offered
53,855 free ebooks for download. The document ﬁles include
the text in a version of the respective edition, which can be
a revised edition or translation. The text editions are linked
as different document ﬁles, e.g., plain text ﬁles, which can
be converted into data entities and integrated with different
data entities. Regarding conceptual knowledge, the Guten-
berg documents use a ﬂat implementation of the Library of
Congress (LoC) classiﬁcation outline [5]. The ebook links
contain some relevant information, too, e.g., the bibliographic
record, EBook-No. 25062, a link the LoC Class entries, and
the release date of the edition. The original publication date
of the source text is contained in the document ﬁles.
Data entities from knowledge resources’ collections and
containers [1] are used with many knowledge mining appli-
cations [3]. Knowledge resources contain multi-disciplinary
knowledge objects, which can be used in arbitrary ways for
providing factual, conceptual, procedural, and meta-cognitive
knowledge. The objects can contain any content and context
as well as references, e.g., translations, transliterations, syn-
onyms, associations, references, conceptual knowledge (e.g.,
UDC), concordances, links, keywords, and Content Factors
(of elements). The objects can be based on records, e.g.,
characters, words, lines, and complex records. Any content and
context can be used for analysis and evaluation of an object.
With the created modules the data entities from the Guten-
berg resources can be handled in the same way as knowledge
resources’ objects, e.g., of different origin. The following case
study starts with a knowledge mining request for “Vesuvius”
in the context of “volcanology”. The primary Gutenberg result
matrix contains a number of documents [6]-[12] provided with
the precomputation.
B. Object and data entity integration
Objects and data entities can be integrated with knowledge
resources in arbitrary ways, e.g., as a referred object or by
creating an instance of an object. The integration allows
an analysis and evaluation, e.g., with knowledge resources’
objects. The following excerpt (Figure 1) shows a knowledge
resources’ object automatically created from an entity of
Gutenberg document 33483 [7] with LoC classiﬁcation [13].

(LX resources, geoscientiﬁc collection, excerpt).
The LX knowledge resources’ structure and the classiﬁcation
references [14] based on UDC [15] are essential means for
the processing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge
objects and containers. Both provide strong multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual support. For this part of the research all
small unsorted excerpts of the knowledge resources objects
only refer to main UDC-based classes, which for this part
of the publication are taken from the Multilingual Universal
Decimal Classiﬁcation Summary (UDCC Publication No. 088)
[16] released by the UDC Consortium under the Creative
Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 license [17] (ﬁrst release
2009, subsequent update 2012).

COMPUTATION AND ANALYSIS
A. Content Factor computation for data entities
Objects of any kind can be integrated with knowledge
resources. Objects can contain instances of data entities and
refer to associated knowledge. For an analysis, a number of
common information regarding the objects and data entities
is required. The following excerpt (Figure 3) illustrates the
creation of Content Factor deﬁnition sets [1] for the use
with data entities. Deﬁnition sets are used for both Gutenberg
resources and knowledge resources.

Figure 5. NBCF κB computed for knowledge resources object
“Vesuvius” (LX Resources, excerpt).
Both NBCF were computed with the same deﬁnition set
(Figure 3). The data entities from the referenced Gutenberg
resources and knowledge resources both contain multiple
matches. The resulting Content Factor for the knowledge
resources object is higher due to the higher concentration of
relevant elements in the object. The Gutenberg object shows
a higher absolute number of matches and multiple hits.
B. Procedures and modules
Two main modules were required with the assistance pre-
computation for identifying and selecting objects and data
entities from the Gutenberg resources before entering the CA
workﬂow. The preparative assistance data was computed with
a module gutenberganalysis and the classiﬁcation was
extracted with a module gutenbergloc. The implementation
case study for the comparative analysis methodology required
the creation of several major components and modules. Table I
shows a sequence of modules, which allows to create the base
for a CA workﬂow as created with this case study.

Practically, the modules can be implemented with any envi-
ronment and frameworks. In the case study Perl, Shell, and
Gnuplot have been used. In general this means any module
could be replaced by a different implementation separately.
Any module requires conﬁguration options, which at least can
be pre-conﬁgured options. In their application, the analysis
up to visualisation modules for the Gutenberg resources are
identical to the application for the knowledge resources. There-
fore, the computations for all data entities were done with the
textca group of modules.

The result shows some criteria of the object itself in context
with the relevant mining pattern. The ﬁgure illustrates that the
object contains a relevant mining result in the ﬁrst and several
consecutive records (here: lines) with a maximal occurance
count of one in a record. The density of relevant occurances in
the object is relatively high compared to common texts, even if
from comparable special topic documents. Therefore, the mean
value is quite high in that case. The computed background
shading illustrates the space spanned by the available records
(number of lines) and element counts. The mean value is
illustrated by the border of the color change.

Figure 10. Comparative Analysis module result for the volcanological features
container for case insensitive vulc/volc target (LX resources).
Both ﬁgures (Figures 10 and 8) illustrate the very high
relevance of the objects. Nevertheless, the structure and density
of hits is much higher in the container object than in the
Gutenberg object. In addition, the mean value is extremely high
for the container object. Also, the central part of the container
object does not contain a line without the target. There are
even more hits than records.
Even in a top hit Gutenberg object the number of records is
much higher and the number of hits is lower. The comparison
also reveals that both objects represent different object types,
a knowledge resources object and a classical text object. The
latter one mostly contains natural language. For any resources,
many CA and Content Factor computations are done on a result
matrix. With any workﬂow further information and decision
making support can result from computing assistant views
for the knowledge entities, e.g., based on their context. The
results of the CA, the Content Factor, classiﬁcation, and any
results and attributes from assistant views can be included in
an analysis, e.g., if a ranking of results is required for a speciﬁc
knowledge mining workﬂow.
V.
DISCUSSION
The case study integrates sources of different knowledge
entities for knowledge mining workﬂows, selecting entities by
computing advanced analysis criteria.
A. Integration and comparison
The selected data compasses over 50,000 Gutenberg doc-
uments and more than 50,000 objects from knowledge re-
sources. The selected sizes of objects range from hundreds
of bytes to several megabytes.
The limitation for the case study was done for demon-
stration, due to the fact that the number of available overall
knowledge resources objects may easily outnumber the number
of Gutenberg documents. With the resources, the classiﬁcation
considers about ﬁfty languages, summing up to about three
million descriptions. Conceptual assistance is available for
resource and object classiﬁcation, which allows to automate
integration workﬂows.
For the integration, instances of the objects containing the
relevant data entities were automatically computed. It was
possible to apply the provided means in the same way to the
entities. The computation for the data entities from knowledge
resources can be much more ﬁne grained and systematic due
to the complex structures and elements. The computation for
the Gutenberg data entities can use the same means but some
details and structure are not automatically available. The data
sizes of the main Gutenberg data entities are most probably
larger than these of the average knowledge resources’ data
entities.
B. CA mean values

There are entities with higher and lower mean values, for the
Gutenberg resources as well as for the knowledge resources.
Higher values indicate a cumulation of relevant terms, e.g., as
with the appearance in collections, tabulars, and listings.

Practice showed that for complementing knowledge in the
volcanological features container with extended context, rele-
vant entities from the Gutenberg resources with higher mean
values can be a primary source for references. Relevant entities
from the Gutenberg resources with lower mean values may
primarily deliver reference information for collection objects.
C. Ranking
For this scenario, a ranking was built from the rankings
for the entities from the Gutenberg entities and from the
knowledge resources.
The ranking considers the available information, e.g., clas-
siﬁed targets, relevance of targets, references and context. The
Gutenberg ranking especially considers the results from the
CA, Content Factor and classiﬁcation (LoC), based on the
primary Gutenberg result matrix. The ranking of knowledge re-
sources especially considers the CA, Content Factor, and clas-
siﬁcation, e.g., UDC and Universal Classiﬁed Classiﬁcation
(UCC). The integrated ranking considers the the CA, Content
Factor values, and concordances of comparable entities.
An integration for a workﬂow ranking requires that the
means need to be individually choosen for a certain application
scenario. In this case, a records base (lines) was an appropriate
choice for CA, Content Factor, and conceptual knowledge.
D. Computational trace and context
A common knowledge discovery process integrates a se-
quence of decision making processes at different levels, e.g.,
from which resources to which single objects. Each step in a
sequence can require to handle millions of objects and refer-
ences. The access to the Gutenberg resources is not intended to
be automated. Therefore, no performance data is available for
the Gutenberg resources or for conducting the precomputation
for its whole content. The precomputation assistance includes
the cached Gutenberg content for the respective mining targets.
Table III shows the computation characteristics relevant with
the workﬂow procedure for an example of the above integrated
Gutenberg and knowledge resources case for two objects.

The table times refer to one Central Processing Unit (CPU)
per mining process (Intel Xeon, at 2.9 GHz). Due to the
complexity of the elementary workﬂows it is not desirable to
have more than one CPU per process involved at the atomic
level. Arbitrary practical application scenarios involving many
processes with large data resources may be organised to ﬁt
the architecture of the available infrastructure. With certain
scenarios, where an author wants to integrate complex refer-
ences, the precomputation assistance can beneﬁt a lot from
using many-CPU infrastructures. The higher level workﬂow
step, integrating the aforementioned procedures, will use a
lot of intermediate results from procedures and content from
resources. There is no general range for the time scale at the
higher levels but at these levels the requirements on compu-
tation and communication can be extremely high, therefore,
the higher level steps are candidates for parallelisation. Any-
how, workﬂow creators must always be aware that computing
requirements can be non-linear, depending on the workﬂow
created by an author for a choosen purpose.
VI.
CONCLUSION
The paper presented an advanced methodology for knowl-
edge mining with multi-disciplinary knowledge resources and
different data entities. Required modules and algorithms were
successfully and efﬁciently implemented for supporting a
Comparative Analysis, integrating different data entities in
mining workﬂows.
This research showed that with the availability of appro-
priate methodologies different entities neither need to be left
out from advanced knowledge mining workﬂows nor should
their content be ignored. It was shown that in result, there is a
complementary relationship between objects from knowledge
resources and referred objects from external sources, including
their data entities.
The Content Factor methodology for data description and
analysis is used with all available resources. As was shown,
CA methods cannot be replaced by other means like classi-
ﬁcation or Content Factor because they are based on com-
pletely different grounds but these complementary means can
be integrated within more complex workﬂows. CA modules
can help optimise the decision making, e.g., with supporting
context-spanning Content Factor deﬁnition sets. CA modules
can be used for delivering additional descriptive information,
which can be used for documentation and knowledge mining
purposes. CA is much beyond statistics. The signiﬁcant part
of the CA is the visualisation of pattern sequences in entities.
The pattern sequences hold relevant parts of the entity charac-
teristics and can also be used for documentation. The statistics
are used in addition, for the analysis.
Objects from advanced knowledge resources can provide an
excellent data base on knowledge. The knowledge resources
can provide high quality object collections and containers with
data entities of most reliable and unique content and qualities.
Referred objects from external sources can extend the avail-
able data base regarding width and depth. Therefore, referred
objects and external sources can extend the available data
base and content. The best ﬁt targets regarding volcanological
features from the resources, including the Gutenberg resources,
were automatically analysed.
On the side of the Gutenberg resources, a number of
challenges have been found especially with the Gutenberg
objects themselves. With the documents, workﬂow creators
face a lot of inconsistencies in structure and marking even
regarding major elements. Bibliographic data and versioning

could also be improved. Better structured and more complete
bibliographic data would be beneﬁcial for any wider and
systematic use. A common container format for the Gutenberg
documents, handling any data ﬁles and associated data in a
ﬂexible and ‘clean’ way would be beneﬁcial.
Besides the purpose laid out with this research, CA modules
can be a complementary and supportive methodology applied
with a wide range of advanced applications like document
identiﬁcation or plagiarism detection. Future work will be
spent on further integrating different resources and creating
methods and means for handling data entities and objects.
