Abstract—In the era of digitisation, innovative technologies
and Information & Communication Technology (ICT) systems
have transformed many areas and domains. The same cannot
be said for Higher Education, especially as this concerns the
certification of degrees, qualifications and other accreditations
of students and job seekers that are still largely in paper form
and require manual and time-consuming processes. Given that
such documents are pertinent not only for education purposes
but also for the job market and Human Resources-related
(HR) processes of private and public organisations, there is a
growing need for automatic and trustworthy systems that can
handle qualification certification while at the same time
providing added value for the job market. This paper is
written under the context of the European Union (EU)-funded
project QualiChain that aspires to investigate the impact of
disruptive technologies, such as blockchain, semantics, data
analytics and gamification in the domain of public education,
as well as the interfaces of the latter with the fields of private
education, the labour market, and public sector administrative
procedures.. The scope of this publication is to perform a
landscape analysis on commercial tools and frameworks that
operate in the aforementioned domains and compare them to
the projected functionality of the QualiChain platform.
Keywords-blockchain; semantics; data analytics; state-of-the-
art; qualification certification; human resources management.
I.
INTRODUCTION
When referring to qualification certification, the most
common thought is a higher education diploma, a piece of
paper that states the knowledge that has been acquired in a
certain scientific field, or the skill to develop a task. The
certification body is the entity that provides a certification
for this diploma and is the legal recogniser of the knowledge.
A typical, paper-based education certificate is a document
that states that a person has received specific education
and/or
evidence
of achievement
of
expected
learning
outcomes. Education certificates are used for a variety of
purposes, such as the recognition of the completion of a
specific learning experience by a student; or the achievement
of a defined amount of knowledge achieved in a specified
area; the acquisition of skills or the attainment of a particular
excellence criterion.
Despite the fact that education certificates find use in
various educational and work related processes (individuals’
further
admission
in
other
educational
and
training
programmes, personnel recruitment, etc.),
they are largely
resisting the pull of technology, as they are still held in
diverse formats in siloed databases, often involving paper
documentation
and
extremely
time-consuming
manual
processes for their verification [1]. Additionally, most higher
education institutions operate in isolated environments with
no connection to the respective labour market that their
graduates are projected to follow. As such, in most cases
there are no tools that can ease the transition of a person
from being a student to a job seeker and the connection
between academia and the labour market is in most cases
non-existent. Consequently, there is a clear lack of a
trustworthy and automatic solutions when it comes to
archiving, managing and verifying educational qualifications
that can operate in various settings and provide added value
to its users.
The slow digitisation of the education sector [2] coupled
with the lack of suitable ICT solutions for education

credentials’ verification, means that holders of such titles are
dependent from issuing/accrediting authorities every time
they want to verify their degrees. This fact does not only
affect academic institutions but also private and public
organisations
in
their
HR-related
tasks.
For
example,
recruitment in an organisation requires combing through
hundreds
of
candidates’
résumés,
weeding
out
the
unqualified ones and narrowing down the rest into a group of
potential
recruits’,
whose
qualifications
and
academic
degrees have to be checked and validated on a case-by-case
basis. However, difficulties in the public and private sector
do not limit to the actual task of recruiting but extend to a
wider set of processes that follow contracting activities,
indicatively encompassing personnel allocation and re-
allocation, staff mobility, and skills’ development and
evaluation.
Solutions
to
these
difficulties
require
fundamental
changes in work practices and processes that extend beyond
the transformation of the recruitment procedure itself and
trace back to the way education and employment credentials
and qualifications themselves are archived, managed and
used and thereby to the way the educational and other
accrediting organisations operate. Disruptive technologies,
such as blockchain, algorithmic techniques, data analytics
and semantics and innovative concepts like gamification may
offer solutions to these challenges. Particularly, blockchain,
as
a
decentralised,
permanent,
unalterable
store
of
information can help with the archiving and trust issues, as
well as provide a frictionless method for transacting with
others, whereas computational intelligence found in the
technological
domains
of
algorithmic
techniques,
data
analytics and semantic analysis may facilitate decision
making and optimise work practices and procedures.
To assess the added value that this combination of
technologies
might
provide
to
the
aforementioned
challenges, it is imperative to assess and evaluate similar
frameworks and tools that operate in the domains of
education and the labour market and provide solutions for
qualification
certification,
recruitment
and
competency
management. Under these circumstances, this paper presents
a state-of-play analysis on 19 tools and frameworks that were
identified in these domains. This analysis was performed
under the context of the EU funded project QualiChain that
aims to combine blockchain, semantics and other innovative
technologies to provide a holistic, trustworthy and automatic
solution in the challenges presented above.
Section I introduces the scope of this paper by presenting
the current situation and challenges arising from the lack of
technical solutions for qualification certification. Section II
introduces
the
QualiChain
project
and
the
platform’s
functionalities. Section III outlines the criteria used for the
analysis and provides a short description of each tool and
framework that was analysed. Finally, Section IV presents
the conclusions of the analysis.
II.
THE QUALICHAIN CONCEPT
QualiChain is a project that aspires to investigate the
impact of disruptive technologies, such as blockchain,
semantics, data analytics and gamification in the domain of
public education, as well as the interfaces of the latter with
the fields of private education, the labour market, and public
sector administrative procedures. The project concept lies in
applying the aforementioned technologies for the design,
implementation, piloting and thorough evaluation of the
QualiChain technological solution, a distributed platform
targeting the storage, service, and verification of academic
and employment qualifications [3]. Apart from educational
and professional certificates verification, QualiChain aims to
develop various added-value tools that can provide solutions
to major challenges in the domains of education and the
labour market. In fact, QualiChain services are structured
along two main pillars, i.e., baseline and value adding
services. The first pillar is grounded upon QualiChain main
technological foundations, namely blockchain and semantics,
enabling
educational
awards’
and
other
qualifications’
archiving
and
storing,
awards’
verification,
the
latter
incorporating,
if
needed,
certificates’
translation
and
equivalence verification, as well as qualifications’ portfolio
management. The second pillar will build upon QualiChain
baseline services to offer with the help of the computational
intelligence, embodied in data analytics and decision support
algorithms, as well as gamification techniques, a set of more
advanced services, including career counselling, intelligent
profiling, and competency management and within the
context of the latter recruitment and evaluation support, and
consulting.
III.
RELATED TOOLS AND FRAMEWORKS
A.
Comparison Criteria
The comparative analysis in the following sections
pertains to the current state of practices regarding tools,
methods and frameworks, similar to QualiChain that are used
in
education
and
public
administration,
as
well
as
commercial applications, and that all the tools presented
therein are released for use and are not under development.
In addition, the tools and frameworks described are not
expected to include every projected function of QualiChain
given that their scope is much more specific. What is useful
though, is to perform a comparison on the state-of-play of
functionalities and technical capabilities included in such
systems
to
identify
innovative
ideas
or
potential
shortcomings of existing solutions. Consequently, for this
comparison the criteria for the analysis largely represent the
high-level technical capabilities of the various modules of
the QualiChain platform and are the following:
1.
Target users: This part of the analysis will help assess if
the list of stakeholders identified for the projected
QualiChain platform is as complete as possible.
2.
Blockchain usage/Data security: Identify the solutions
that employ blockchain or other data security methods
3.
Personalisation
approach:
This
criterion
will
help
compare the various approaches that make the tools
more user-centric
4.
Use of Semantics/data interoperability: Distil the tools
that provide the capability for data analytics and in less
innovative solutions other searchable interfaces as well
as the available pool of data.

5.
Gamification
approach:
Identify
approaches
that
increase user engagement
6.
Qualification certification and Multilinguality: This
criterion pertains to the tools that certify qualifications.
Two important sub-criteria here further divide the tools
into automatic and non-automatic as well as the
capability to translate degrees in multiple languages
7.
Recruitment & Competency Management: This criterion
pertains to the solutions that offer to organisations the
ability to perform various HR related tasks.
8.
Open source/APIs: This criterion will help identify the
openness of each tool and the potential to create
synergies with QualiChain.
B.
Selected Tools & Indicative Analysis Tables
The tools and frameworks analysed under the context of
this publication were the following:
1.
Qualification Check [4] (tool): Qualification Check
offer a global solution for qualification verifications,
supported by a team of multilingual education experts.
Qualification Check provides qualification validation to
help stop the damaging and costly effect credentials
fraud has on organisations.
2.
Recognition
Finder
[5]
(tool
and
framework):
Recognition Finder is a tool for the recognition of
foreign professional qualifications in Germany. It
presents
important
information
about
the
legal
foundations, the recognition procedures for individual
occupations and the available counselling services in a
concise form. The tool in not automatic but rather finds
the competent authority that the user needs to contact
for the respective occupation.
3.
European Credit Transfer & Accumulation System [6]
(credit and grading system): ECTS is a credit system
designed to make it easier for students to move between
different countries. Since credits are based on the
learning achievements and workload of a course, a
student can transfer their European Credit Transfer
System (ECTS) credits from one university to another,
so they are added up to contribute to an individual's
degree programme or training.
4.
UHR Recognition of foreign qualifications [7] (tool and
framework):
The
Swedish
Council
for
Higher
Education evaluates foreign qualifications to provide
support for people looking for work in Sweden, people
who wish to continue studying, or for employers who
wish to employ someone with foreign qualifications.
The tool includes an online application to apply for an
evaluation and recognition of qualifications; however,
the validation is not performed automatically.
5.
ServiceNow [8] (tool): The ServiceNow module offers
an expansive portfolio of training offerings across IT,
HR, Customer Service and other departments that cover
the Now Platform (HR and workflow organisation
platform
for
enterprises).
Moreover,
it
provides
certifications upon mastering new features offered in
the latest release of the platform, micro-certification on
a
variety of subjects
as
well
as
verification
of
certifications
received
through
the
ServiceNow
platform.
6.
Teacher Certification [9] (framework): The Teacher
Certification framework of the British Columbia is a
framework that provides a number of services to UK
Ministry-certified
educators.
Among
them
are
certification services, criminal record checks and fee
information.
The
framework
includes
complete
instructions regarding certification offices, pertinent e-
mail addresses and the complete methodological steps
that a teacher should follow to complete a certain task.
7.
DegreeVerify
[10]
(tool):
DegreeVerify
provides
immediate online verifications of college degrees and
attendance. It provides prompt access to many degree
and
attendance
records
and
eliminates
the
complications
and
delays
associated
with
manual
processing through individual schools. It can also
reduce the risk and cost of making bad hiring decisions
as
well
as
ensure
only
verified
eligible
student
customers
are
eligible
for
receiving
offers
from
prospective employers.
8.
WES Degree Equivalency Tool [11] (tool): The WES
Degree Equivalency Tool compares a user’s education
credentials to Canadian standards. It allows a user to
select the country he/she studied in, enter his/her
credentials and the tool shows the degree equivalency.
The Degree Equivalency tool doesn’t replace an official
evaluation, but rather estimates the degree equivalency.
9.
Higher Education Degree Datacheck [12] (tool): HEDD
is UK’s official degree verification hub, used by
organisations, institutions and universities to verify
degrees. HEDD cannot be used by students or graduates
to verify their own rewards, which means that the
organisation using the tool’s services will have to
request a proof of consent from the individual.
10. NOKUT Recognition of foreign education in Norway
[13] (framework): NOKUT if a framework that helps
institutions, organisations and universities to validate
foreign higher education degrees, vocational education
and training certifications. It includes an exhaustive list
of regulated professions and industries and a pertinent
list of recognition authorities that users of the system
will have to contact to get recognised in Norway.
11. Vitnemalsportalen Diploma registry [14] (tool): The
Diploma registry is a Norwegian service that helps
users
automatically
collect
results
from
higher
education institutions in Norway and share them with
potential employers, educational institutions and other
relevant recipients. Moreover, all transmissions are
encrypted and only the sender can decide who he/she
wants to share the data with.
12. e-CF 2.0 Profiling tool [15] (tool): The objective of the
tool is to bring to life the content of e-CF version 3.0
and provide linkage to the EU ICT Professional
profiles. It helps users build their profiles based on their
11
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-764-1
eLmL 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

preferred orientation (e.g., job profile or education
profile) and provides comparisons between user created
profiles and established ICT professional profiles to
support skill gap identification. The tool also supports
multiple languages.
13. CEPIS e-Competence Benchmark [16] (tool): CEPIS is
a free online tool that helps assess ICT professionals’
skills, based on the e-CF. This tool provides ICT
professionals with a personal competence gap analysis
that compares their competences against those required
for a range of European ICT professional profiles. This
enables individuals to plan their career development
and make informed decisions about further education.
14. e-Competences assessment and certification assessment
[17] (tool): This tool lets users compose their own
professional profile, find the best matching ICT profiles
and choose the certificates that could help them meet
their aspirations. It provides users with three distinct
functionalities: a self-assessment tool, comparison of e-
competence related certificates and an e-competence
demand and supply calculator.
15. IT Staffing Nederland [18] (tool): IT Staffing is
embedding the European Competence Framework in
their recruiting and matching systems, for the sake of
better transparency and quality on this process. The tool
takes advantage of semantics for translation of ICT
texts
into
digital
e-competences
and
provides
transparency
to
better
interpret
job
descriptions,
vacancy texts, incoming CVs and training materials.
16. Blockcerts [19] (tool): Blockcerts is an open standard
for
creating,
issuing,
viewing,
and
verifying
blockchain-based certificates. These digital records are
registered on a blockchain, cryptographically signed,
tamper-proof, and shareable. The goal is to give to
individuals the capacity to possess and share their own
official records.
17. Diplome [20] (tool): Diplome is a blockchain-powered
credential
evaluation
service
that
generates
a
“certificate wallet”, in which it is possible to upload
one’s qualifications, making it easier for a student,
graduate or professional to enrol in a foreign university
or enter the labour market in a foreign country.
Diplome is a global ecosystem, which can be used by
authorities
and
institutions
to
securely
and
unchangeably register education/training documents,
guaranteeing their transferability and authenticity.
18. LinkChain [21] (tool): LinkChain is a Blockchain-
enabled
Linked
Data
Platform
catered
to
data
publishers and consumers that provides certificate
equivalence
verification,
credential
auditing
&
verification while supporting multi-lingual capabilities
as well.
19. Blockchain for Education [22] (tool): The available
blockchain
tool
(part
of
a
platform
that
is
in
development) enables learners to present their digital
certificates
while
also
supporting
certification
authorities in the management and archiving of digital
certificates. The tool relies on blockchain to enable
tamper-proof archiving of certificates and their correct
and permanent allocation to the learners. The existing
in-use
tool
relies
on
Open
Badges
and
uses
JSON/JSON-LD for metadata and as a basis for
querying (verification purposes).
For the analysis of the tools and frameworks that are
presented above, the following tables (see TABLE I) were
used to describe the general functionality of each tool, the
technologies implemented in it and the added value that they
provide to users.

Description
Recognition Finder is a tool for the recognition of foreign professional
qualifications in Germany. Moreover, those seeking advice only need a
few clicks and this online tool will name the competent authority for their
application. In addition, it presents important information about the legal
foundations, the recognition procedures for individual occupations and
available counselling services in a concise form. Recognition Finder does
not automatically verify the user’s qualifications but finds the competent
authority that the user needs to contact for the respective occupation.
Implemented technologies and functionalities

Recognition check allows users to see whether their professional
qualifications are recognised in Germany

The portal is available in German and English, as well as Arabic,
French, Greek, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and
Turkish.

For mobile use, there is also the "Recognition in Germany" app,
which offers the information in seven languages

The database currently contains more than 1,500 different contact
addresses for the recognition procedures of occupations
Added Value

In the "Recognition Finder", the user can enter his or her profession
and use the occupational profile displayed to determine the German
vocational certificate that matches the qualifications acquired
abroad.

Just a few clicks are sufficient to get the address where an
application for an assessment of equivalence can be submitted.

All the information that is important for submitting an application is
summarised
–
for
example
the documents
required
for
an
application.
Following that, a comparison table was created that
analyses each tool based on the criteria described in Section
III.A. An indicative section of the comparison table can be
seen in TABLE II.

purpose of the table was to help draw the conclusions that
will be presented in the following section (Section IV).
IV.
DISCUSSION
This section will conclude on the approaches that were
analysed and the potential/projected position of QualiChain
in the domains of Qualification Certification and Human
Resource Management. The conclusions will be based on the
eight criteria that were defined for the comparative matrix as
well as the overall added value of the presented tools.
The target users constitute the only criterion where no
significant differences among the various approaches can be
noted. In fact, given that the tools presented are tailored for
the stakeholders either in the domain of education, or that of
the job market/HR management or a combination of both, it
stands to reason that the target users are like those of
QualiChain. Identified target users include students, job
seekers,
employers,
private
and
public
organisations,
government agencies, education providers, regulators, HR
teams and recruitment firms among others. This fact gives
credence
to
QualiChain’s
approach
for
stakeholder
identification
and
proves
that
the
list
of
QualiChain
stakeholders is as exhaustive and complete as it needs to be.
Moving on to other criteria, the analysis showed that only
4/19 (Blockcerts, Diplome, LinkChain, Blockchain for
Education) tools take advantage of Blockchain ledgers and
decentralised standards for the purposes of record keeping,
issuing and verification of certifications. While, it is a fact
that blockchains are harder to implement compared to more
traditional databases, their capabilities for secure distribution
of certificates, security, data privacy and immutability are
considered to be of paramount importance for minimising
fraud around educational and other certificates. Moreover,
considering the approaches that did not use blockchain, only
2/19 (Qualification Check, DegreeVerify) keep any records
of transactions and 1/19 (Vitnemalsportalen) provides any
level of security by adding digital signatures on documents.
Concerning
semantics
and
data
interoperability
approaches, of all the tools that were described, only 4/19
took it into account. Specifically, IT Staffing Nederland
applies semantic software that translates ICT texts into
digital
e-competencies
while
Diplome
applies
other
standards of interoperability on the data. On the other hand,
Blockchain for Education, offers JSON-LD support which
can therefore provide the required verification methodology.
Furthermore, LinkChain is projected to be fully semantic and
support public and private RDF. Moreover, 4/19 solutions
had minor data analytics capabilities, mainly for the purpose
of matching between a student’s/ job seeker’s profile and the
skills required for a given position. Finally, 6/19 approaches
provided some data structure coupled with searchable
registries for the user’s convenience. Such searches are only
applied on static data and do not provide any automatic
capabilities for analysis except for LinkChain that provides a
federated searchable Linked Data Platform.
Another
criterion
studied,
was
the
level
of
personalisation that each tool provides for a more user-
centric experience. The results here are more encouraging
given
that
8/19
approaches
provide
some
level
of
personalisation for a user’s profile. For example, tools like
ECTS make learning more user-centred via use of credits as
currency. In addition, WES offers digital badges used to
display verified credentials on social media sites like
LinkedIn. Moreover, tools that are powered by the European
e-Competence Framework, provide users with the capability
to develop their profiles based on preferred orientation and
competence gap analyses. Finally, the approaches that take
advantage
of
Blockchain
(Blockcerts,
Diplome
and
LinkChain) provide each user with a valid and verified
certificate/ qualifications wallet.
Concerning gamification, there are no tools that provide a
clear solution. While there are some tools that provide some
degree of informal gamification with credits and digital
badges, the overall conclusion is that the community does
not consider it to be that important for the developed tools.
However, given that most of the tools are free of charge and
offer
solutions
of
low
technical
capabilities
that
are
13
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-764-1
eLmL 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

realistically applied in Niche markets, it makes sense that
gamification cannot be a priority in such systems.
The main criteria of the analysis revolve around the two
main high-level functionalities that QualiChain will also
provide, i.e., Qualification Certification and Recruitment/
Competency Management. One clear division between the
various tools, has to do with the level of automation that they
provide. Only 4/19 solutions are non-automatic meaning that
they
do
not
automatically
certify/validate
users’
qualifications but rather help them navigate through the
various procedures that they will have to follow in order to
get certified in a given country or domain.
The rest of the solutions provide various levels of
automation and will be assessed based on the actual added
value that they offer on the entire end-to-end procedure of
either
Qualification
Certification
or
Recruitment/
Competency
Management.
Starting
from
Recruitment/
Competency Management, no tools were found that offer
holistic solutions in a pan-European level. Specifically, while
most solutions offer solid functionalities for organisations
that can help their HR teams make staffing and strategic
decisions, tools like NOKUT (Norway) mainly apply for
their own country and other tools (e-CF 2.0 profiling tool,
CEPIS
e-Competence
benchmark,
e-Competences
assessment and certification assessment and IT staffing
Nederland) have application only for ICT positions and
organisations. On the other hand, platforms like LinkChain
do not directly offer such functionalities but support external
analytics and can serve as a data backend for qualification
analysis,
opportunity
identification,
competency
development & evaluation, etc.
On
the
contrary
and
concerning
the
domain
of
Qualification Certification, there are a number of solutions
that provide added value in every step of the process. Tools
like Qualification Check, ECTS, Blockcerts, Diplome,
LinkChain
and
Blockchain
for
Education
are
holistic
solutions that automatically handle every step of the process
while some of them have been adopted by multiple
countries. However, there are still solutions that are country
specific (Vitnemalsportalen, DegreeVerify) that do not offer
the full range of functionalities for every type of user
(HEDD) and others like the ServiceNow module that offer
micro-accreditations for expertise in specific platforms and
tools.
In
addition,
only
five
approaches
support
Multilinguality and only three of them (NOKUT, Diplome,
LinkChain)
offer
functionalities
for
both
Qualification
Certification and Recruitment/ Competency Management.
One of the key suggestions of QualiChain is that having both
services operate in a single platform seamlessly will further
connect high-level education with the job market so that each
domain can learn from the other and help students, job
seekers and organisations make more informed decisions.
Finally, the fact that 8/19 tools have APIs that allow them to
connect with other systems can potentially help QualiChain
synergise with them.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
The scope of this paper was to perform a state-of-play
analysis on tools, applications and frameworks used in the
domains of Qualification Certification or Recruitment/
Competency Management. All in all, most of the tools that
were
analysed
are
either
commercial
applications
or
country/domain-specific and are usually focused on specific
functionalities that are useful in some steps of the processes
required by students, job seekers, educational institutions and
organisations
of
all
types.
This
gives
credence
to
QualiChain’s holistic approach and proves that there is a
vacuum on the market of the domains tackled by the project.
In fact, not only does QualiChain aim to fill a void in the
market but also to advance the state-of-the-art by developing
a
holistic
platform
that
provides
open
semantic
interoperability and data privacy by extending the research in
blockchain, semantics, data analytics and gamification.
