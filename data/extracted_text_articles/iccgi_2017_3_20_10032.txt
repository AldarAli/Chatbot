Abstract—The aim of this work is to introduce a framework for
the analysis and evaluation of potential In-memory applications.
As a base for the framework, relevant inﬂuencing factors for the
use of In-memory systems were identiﬁed. For the evaluation and
the identiﬁcation of further inﬂuencing factors, an expert survey
was carried out. The results show that aspects relevant to com-
panies were not considered in the past. Therefore, a structured
analysis framework is introduced considering also economical
factors. The use of the framework and the interpretation of
the results will be clariﬁed in the end using selected ﬁelds of
application.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2014, Amazon introduced the ”Prime Now”
service, which guarantees the delivery of several thousands of
products within an hour [1]. In the ﬁeld of high frequency
trading, fractions of a second can determine proﬁt or loss
[2]. Sociologists have been talking about this subject as the
”age of acceleration” for quite some time [3]. Never before in
history were decision makers forced to make entrepreneurial
decisions under greater time pressure than today. Furthermore,
increasingly huge and heterogeneous data sets are challenging
companies. One of the most promising technologies for solving
these challenges are In-memory-based IT systems (IMIS).
Although the technology was subject to high expectations
in the past, the predicted boom has not yet begun. In this
context, many companies complain about the lack of useful
and economical application scenarios [4][5]. In a study by the
American SAP user group, this point is mentioned as one of the
main causes for the delayed distribution [6]. The reasons for
this is, among others, the previous focus on technical aspects
[7]. A study by the market research company PAC [8], on the
other hand, shows that the In-memory technology is of great
interest to many companies and can play an important role
in the future. 36% of the surveyed company representatives
see this technology as an important building block in future
IT landscapes. In this ﬁeld of tension, it becomes clear that
the In-memory technology has great potential that has not yet
been exploited.
In this work, we will introduce a design science based
system, able to identify and evaluate inﬂuential factors for
potential application scenarios of IMIS. The aim of this
approach is to examine existing as well as potential future
scenarios. Based on an analysis framework, the requirements
and their feasibility of use cases are examined. In order to
identify possible inﬂuencing factors of In-memory application
scenarios, case studies and scientiﬁc literature are analyzed.
Subsequently, the inﬂuence factors found are evaluated with
the help of ﬁeld experts who participated in an expert survey,
also identifying yet unknown and additional factors.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
the technical background, the existing literature about IMIS
and the general methodology. Section III presents in the ﬁrst
part the results of the literature review and the expert survey.
In the second part of section III the conceptual framework
is introduced and its application is shown. The ﬁnal section
summarizes the contributions to practice and research.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND
The idea of using main memory to store data is not
new. These concepts were introduced in the 1980s and 1990s
[9][10]. At that time, the main focus was very fast response
times which were realized by main memory databases. Due
to high costs and low memory sizes, the interest regarding In-
memory databases decreased and the technology almost fell
into oblivion. With the introduction of the HANA platform
[11], SAP has once again placed the focus on IMIS. The
previous concerns about the durability of the stored data
could be eliminated by the use of non-volatile RAM [12].
The concept of IMIS includes more than a pure data storage
in the main memory. In contrast to conventional relational
databases, the data is no longer stored row-based, but mainly
column-based [13]. The advantage of a column-based storage
is on the one side a better data compression and on the
other side a better suitability for analytical tasks. Originally,
the main application area of IMIS were fast and ﬂexible
analysis of large amounts of data in data warehouses. In the
meantime, the application areas were extended to transaction
systems. The goal here is to dissolve the historically grown
separation between online analytical processing (OLAP) and
online transaction processing (OLTP) systems [14][15]. These
hybrid systems are referred to as Online Mixed Workload
Processing (OLXP) [16] and Hybrid Transactional/Analytical
Processing (HTAP) [17].
The advantage of a common data storage is the elimination
of ETL processes from the OLTP into the OLAP system. In
addition, transactional data can be used for analytical and
planning tasks. Furthermore, there is a potential for savings
through the elimination of an additional system [18]. However,
it is important to note that analysis and transaction systems
have fundamentally different characteristics and requirements
[19]. Analytical systems are generally used for the support
of specialists and executives. Decisions at these company
levels are, in most cases, characterized as strategically or
tactically, that means for a longer period. The data access
during the execution of analyzes are almost exclusively read-
only [19]. On the other hand, transaction systems are used
to solve everyday business tasks of a company. In most
cases, the time horizon only covers a relatively short period
[20]. The typical transactional workload is also largely read
access, but compared with analyzes, with a signiﬁcantly higher

proportion of write accesses [19]. The merging of OLAP
and OLTP systems to an OLXP / HTAP system leads not
only to the advantages mentioned, but also to problems and
difﬁculties. From a technical point of view, hybrid workloads
(line / column-based & read / write) must be simultaneously
processed [21][22][23]. The merging process also leads to
a stronger dependency on the respective system provider. In
order to be able to exploit the entire beneﬁt of an IMIS, a large
number of applications and processes have to be adapted.
IT providers, such as SAP have predominantly driven the
hype surrounding the In-memory technology in the past years.
The focus of recent developments was mostly technology-
oriented. Similar tendencies can be found in early scientiﬁc
work in this ﬁeld. Mainly technical features, such as the
column-based storage of data [13], data compression [24] or
the persistence of volatile storage media [25] were investigated.
An alternative approach for the analysis of possible In-memory
applications tries to assess the advantages and potentials on
the basis of business requirements. In the ﬁrst papers in this
area [26][27] Piller and Hagedorn are investigating factors for
evaluating In-memory applications. The authors examine the
potential of IMIS in the retail sector. Despite the early matu-
ration phase of this technology at the time of the investigation,
initial application patterns have already been identiﬁed.
Similar results are also reported by Cundius et. al in their
work [28]. They developed a model for evaluating real-time IT
systems. The focus of this work was on the workﬂow-speciﬁc
properties of real-time IT systems. The use of IMIS not only
has an impact on data processing, but also on the downstream
decision-making and implementation processes. Vom Brocke
et. al examine the connection between the In-memory technol-
ogy and the resulting business use in their papers [29][30][31].
They conclude that a value-creation for companies is strongly
related to the adaption of processes. Vom Brocke et al. as well
as B¨arenf¨anger et al. [32] conclude that the introduction of In-
memory technology not only leads to a direct beneﬁt, but to a
large extent to downstream improvements in the process ﬂow.
Meier et al. further pursue the aim of an economic evaluation
in [33]. They also divided the economic effects into direct and
indirect attributable effects.
One of the most important innovations of IMIS is the
combination of analysis and transaction systems. Winter et
al. analyze the properties of IMIS in one of the ﬁrst case
studies [34]. In addition to the volume of data, the integration
of the analysis and transaction system is identiﬁed as the most
important indicator for the assessment of IMIS. This point is
also highlighted in several other scientiﬁc papers in this ﬁeld
[16][26][27][35]. From a solely technical perspective, IMIS
offers huge potential. However, the question arises for which
companies or application areas this potential can be exploited
in practice. For many companies predeﬁned reports and eval-
uations on a daily basis will still be sufﬁcient. For others,
the use of real-time data can become a decisive competitive
advantage. Previous application examples often refer to very
speciﬁc or exotic tasks. A popular example of the application
of IMIS is the analysis of sports data, e.g., in Formula 1 [36]
or soccer [37]. Although these examples are quite illustrative,
they are not suitable to provide insights into the solution
of ”everyday” business problems. The lack of economical
use cases is regarded as one of the main obstacles to the
distribution of IMIS. This is mentioned in science literature
[26][35][38] as well as from a company point of view [4][7].
III.
A FRAMEWORK FOR THE EVALUATION AND
ANALYSES OF IN-MEMORY BASED IT SYSTEMS
The aim of this research work is to examine and structure
IMIS use cases with regard to their success factors. Based on
these factors an analysis and evaluation framework has been
developed as seen in Figure 1. The methodology described
by Klein and Scholl [39] was used to deﬁne the overall
structure of the framework. The main advantage of the used
methodology is the avoidance of structural defects during the
modeling phase. Hereby, it is possible to develop a well-
designed and feasible decision model. For this purpose, the
scope of the model was ﬁrst restricted in order to consider only
the aspects, which are relevant for the problem solving. After
the relevant inﬂuential factors were identiﬁed, they were sub-
divided through a structural analysis. As a result of this struc-
turing process, an operationalizable target system for assessing
and analyzing In-memory use cases has been created. The

methodology of Design Science Research was used as the base
for the framework. The advantage of this approach is that the
dynamic characteristics of business needs can be directly taken
into account. The design process is not static, it allows changes
to be incorporated into the existing model [40][41]. In order to
gather the basic factors inﬂuencing the framework, scientiﬁc
work and previous case studies in the ﬁeld of IMIS were ana-
lyzed and evaluated during the ﬁrst design phase. In terms of
research method, this was accomplished according to Webster
and Watson [42]. In the literature review, established literature
databases (AIS Electronic Library, EmeraldInsight, IEEEX-
plore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Google Scholar) were
investigated. The search included the following key words: ”In-
Memory Computing”, ”In-Memory Technology”, ”In-Memory
Database”, ”In-Memory IT System” and ”In-Memory Data
Management”. Subsequently, a backward search was carried
out. Therefore only papers dealing with the application and
the business perspective of IMIS were used. The study of
the literature databases revealed that around 2400 scientiﬁc
publications have so far dealt with IMIS. Due to the context of
this paper only publications with an business perspective were

considered. Hence, 30 relevant papers remained. The detailed
results are explained in the next section. During the second
design phase,as seen in Figure 1, a qualitative expert survey
[43] was carried out to evaluate the results and identify further
factors. In particular, the expert survey was carried out to reveal
further ﬁndings on challenges from an economic point of view.
In order to cover a broad range of opinions and experiences,
the experts were composed of representatives from different
ﬁelds. Totally 25 experts in the ﬁeld of IMIS were interviewed.
These included scientists, company representatives as well as
representatives of leading IMIS providers. In semi-structured
interviews the experts were asked about the potential and the
obstacles of the In-memory technology. In addition, the experts
were asked to evaluate possible application scenarios and their
characteristics in detail. In the ﬁnal step, the application of the
model will be presented using selected In-memory use cases
from the retail sector.
A. Results of the literature and case study review
The examined works used different approaches to deal
with the analysis and assessment of the scenarios. The work
[26] by Piller and Hagedorn has proven to be a suitable
basis for the model presented in this work. Starting from
the business process characteristics described in this study,
further inﬂuencing factors were identiﬁed and classiﬁed. In the
following, the examined factors are presented and explained.
Main memory-based databases are often mentioned to
solve the challenges which are associated with so called
Big Data applications. Due to the availability of larger main
memory and advanced compression by the column orientation,
IMIS is able to process large amounts of data [18][44].
Therefore, it is appropriate to include the data volume of a
use case into the consideration. Apart from the data volume,
a number of other factors play a decisive role. These include,
for example, the urgency of the results [26][27][31][45] or the
dynamics of the data [26][27][28]. Hence, high-performance
systems have a strong positive effect if the data changes
frequently. If the underlying data changes only very rarely and
to a small extent, the potential additional value of a real-time
result is very limited. An example for this are purchase pro-
posals in large online shops based on customer segmentation,
which change in general only rarely or marginally. A further
inﬂuencing parameter is the number and type of source systems
[46][47]. In order to cover a broad range of information, it may
be advantageous to integrate several different source systems.
However, from a critical point of view, problems emerge.
The transmission from external sources can lead to delays. A
further and currently very often-discussed topic is the veracity
of information [48].
As already mentioned in section II, business processes must
be adapted with regard to the newly gained ﬂexibility and
speed of data analysis in order to exploit the full potential
[28][29][30]. The need for process adaptation has to be clari-
ﬁed on the base of the time business-value relationship concept
from Hackathorn [45]. Figure 2 visualizes this concept and
shows that the information-processing latency caused by IMIS
can be reduced, but the additional business proﬁt is relatively
low. In order to generate a higher added value, it is also
necessary to modify and accelerate the downstream decision-
making and implementation processes.

B. Results of the expert survey
In order to evaluate the results and identify further inﬂu-
ential factors, an expert study was conducted. One of the most
frequent mentioned points in the interviews was the uncertain
investment security. Despite the decline in hardware costs,
the purchase of a main memory-based information system is
associated with both high investment costs and a signiﬁcant
total cost of ownership [33]. As with any other investment
decision, sufﬁcient value must be generated to cover the cost
of acquisition. A large proportion of the interviewed company
representatives have criticized the poor cost-beneﬁt ratio con-
cerning IMIS and mentioned several reasons for that evalu-
ation. In most business applications, mainly ”conventional”
analyses and evaluations are carried out. These are already
deﬁned in advance or can be well predicted and scheduled.
Due to the tactical or strategic character of the decisions, there
is no exceptional urgency to obtain the results in most cases.
Apart from traditional OLAP tasks, the In-memory technol-
ogy is perceived more positively. This includes, for example,
the areas of predictive maintenance or the integration and
analysis of social media. To implement a predictive mainte-
nance, a large number of sensors must be integrated into the
analytical system. The continuous measurement results in a
high volume of data. Ideally, these data should be analysed
as quickly as possible. Another example is the processing
of social media, where large quantities of unstructured texts
have to be processed. These two examples already conﬁrm
a signiﬁcant proportion of the inﬂuencing factors from the
ﬁrst design phase. Another important criterion mentioned
frequently were implementation conditions. According to the
experts, not only the speed of decision-making is a relevant
factor, but also the technical effort and legal obstacles that have
to be considered. These factors were not taken into account
in the previous literature. Efforts for the indoor localization
or digital price tags were cited as examples for technical
obstacles. An example for legal obstacles are the data privacy
laws regarding the analysis of personal data, especially in EU
countries like Germany, Spain or the Netherlands.
C. Conception and structuring of the framework
The literature review as well as the results from the
expert study make clear that a variety of factors inﬂuence
the assessment of IMIS scenarios. For a systematic analysis,
it is necessary to structure the identiﬁed inﬂuencing factors.

Figure 3 summarizes the results gathered from both the lit-
erature review and the expert study. Based on the results of
the literature review, the factors can be clustered into two
main categories: data and analysis factors. In the category
analysis factors, a large part of the investigations dealt with
questions of urgency, complexity or ﬂexibility of analysis.
Another segment of research focuses on data-driven factors.
These include, among other issues, the volume, the topicality
and the dynamics of data. As the hesitant spread of IMIS
shows, the technical advantages alone are not enough to
generate a substantial beneﬁt. In the past research of IMIS,
this fact was rarely taken into account. To consider aspects
which are related to, e.g., real-time decisions and to take the
results of our expert study into account, the categories were
extended by the category of economic factors. This category
contains factors with regard to internal as well as external
implementation conditions, which are particularly important
in the corporate context. The different characteristics of the
factors show that some have a positive effect on the use of
IMIS, while others have a negative impact. This means, e.g.,
that high requirements regarding the urgency of evaluations
have a positive effect on the evaluation of an IMIS. To take
this into account, we have added an inﬂuence indicator to our
framework.

D. Application example of the framework
The functionality of the framework will be shown based
on selected application examples from the retail sector. These
examples were discussed during the expert interviews and in
ﬁrst case studies. For reasons of space, only the example
”analysis of sales and inventory data” [26] is explained in
detail. For a better interpretation the results are summarized
in the end.
1) Case study ”analysis of sales and inventory data”.: The
goal of the ”analysis of sales and inventory data” [26] scenario
is to discover anomalies in advertising and sales ﬁgures. High
requirements are formulated regarding the urgency, the volume
of data and the dynamics of the data of the IT system.
The analysis of the information is mostly based on recurring
standard reports. The complexity of the evaluation as well as
the complexity of the underlying data in this case study is
typically low. Sales documents in the retail sector are well-
structured and can therefore be easily processed. A complex
transformation is not necessary. All required data can be
obtained from internal sources. Hence, there is no latency by
loading data from external sources. Due to the high range of
ﬂuctuations in sales ﬁgures [55], the economic beneﬁt of rapid
intervention is quite high. At this point, the question arises
which measures can be taken to minimize the ﬂuctuations. In
the work of Piller and Hagedorn, only non-price measures to
reduce sales ﬂuctuation are proposed [26]. In this case, there
are no legal or technical obstacles to the realization of the
measures. Evaluating the presented scenario characteristics it
becomes clear that analytical requirements are on a high level
and the data requirements are on a medium level. Due to
the high economic beneﬁts and low implementation obstacles,
the overall potential for IMIS according to our framework is
considered very high. In contrast to this, other examples show
signiﬁcant differences in the technical as well as the economic
indicators.
2) Case study ”dynamic prices”.: For the example of
dynamic prices [30], similar conditions apply as for the ﬁrst
scenario. From a technical perspective, the determination of
dynamic and customer-speciﬁc prices is hardly a problem for
current IT systems. In order to deploy a price differentiation,
further prerequisites must be fulﬁlled. The information when
a customer enters the shop and where he is located has to be
available [56]. From a technical point of view, the challenge
is to locate the customer exactly on several ﬂoors. Another
fundamental requirement is the customers willingness to pay
that individual price [54]. Reports about the introduction of
individual discounts by a German retail company for example,
led to extensive criticism and reluctance of the customers [57].
3) Evaluation of the case study results.: The evaluation of
the attributes from a technical point of view implies the suit-
ability of an IMIS for both use cases. The large data volume,
the recently changing data, the need for quick responses and
the combination of analytical and transactional tasks are strong
indicators. The beneﬁt of the presented framework becomes
especially clear when the economic factors are considered.
These factors indicate problems regarding the realization of
the second example. With the help of the structured model
shown in Fig.2, corporate decision makers can create a more
holistic evaluation of potential use cases.
IV.
CONCLUSION
The aim of this work was to create a framework for
analyzing and evaluating application scenarios in the context
of IMIS. As current research as well as statements from
industry experts show, such a framework was missing. To
cover all relevant factors for the application of an IMIS, not
only theoretical work was included in this work. Through the
inclusion of corporate experts, also practical aspects have been
considered. Based on some of the ﬁrst case studies in this area
and scientiﬁc work, a large part of the inﬂuencing factors could
be identiﬁed. Results show that the inﬂuence factors found
through literature review and expert study could be divided
into three main categories: analysis factors, data-driven factors
and economic factors. Based on the expert survey, it was
also possible to conﬁrm the factors from the literature and to
uncover other previously unconsidered factors. In order to take
account of all aspects relevant to the companies, the model was

expanded by features with regard to the proﬁtability and the
feasibility of possible ﬁelds of application. These include, for
instance, the implementation conditions, legal obstacles or the
willingness of target groups. Using the presented model, it is
possible to examine potential and existing real-world scenarios
regarding their requirements and their feasibility. In a next
step, it will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of the
framework based on quantitative investigations. To consider
branch-speciﬁc variations of the relevance of the inﬂuence
factors it is further useful to include corresponding weighting
factors.
