Abstract—Mathematical modeling and numerical simulation
of non-linear mathematical model for digital simulation of an
enzyme loaded porous microreactor is investigated in this paper.
The model is based on a system of reaction-diffusion equations,
containing a non-linear term related to the Michaelis-Menten
kinetics, and involves three regions: the enzyme microreactor
where the enzyme reaction as well as mass transport by diffu-
sion take place, a diffusion limiting region (the Nernst layer),
where only the mass transport by diffusion takes place, and
a convective region, where the constant analyte concentration
is maintained. The digital simulation was carried out using
the ﬁnite difference technique. Assuming well-stirred conditions,
impact of the diffusion modulus and the Biot number as well as
porosity on transient effectiveness factor and yield factor has been
numerically investigated. The simulation results showed that the
Nernst layer must be taken into consideration when modelling
micro-size bioreactors. The computational simulations showed
that the yield factor and the effectiveness factors have different
properties to describe system productivity.
Keywords—reaction-diffusion; Michaelis - Menten kinetics;
microbioreactor; porosity; CSTR.
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper is an extension of the work originally reported
in The Ninth International Conference on Advances in System
Simulation [1].
Continuous-ﬂow stirred tank reactors (CSTR) are common
in chemical industries [2][3]. Although a stirred tank is a usual
construction of industrial enzyme reactors, the effectiveness
and optimal construction of CSTR remain open to study [4][5].
Speciﬁcally, further research is needed due to the application
of the immobilized enzymes, such as biocatalysts, on a man-
ufactoring scale that requires to use the reactors of different
types, including CSTR [6][7][8].
The CSTR often refers to the model used to estimate
the operation parameters when using a continuous agitated-
tank reactor to reach a speciﬁed output [7].
In the last few
decades, immobilized enzyme reactor models have evolved
signiﬁcantly with a wide range of applications in food industry
[9], waste cleaning [10], immobilization of microbial cells
[11][12]. The main advantages of immobilized cells over non-
immobilized cells can be enumerated: (1) incapsulation not
only keep enzyme from wash out, but also protect it during
the changes of various conditions, such as pH, temperature,
and toxic compounds; (2) cells do not stick up to bioreactors
or other materials within the reactor; (3) reusability; and (4)
control over reactions that are allowed, shell can be formated
to avoid the diffusion of all material to microreactor. Rapid
progress was noticed in integrating microﬂuidic reactors and
biocatalytic reactions [13]. The combination of miniaturized
technologies and microﬂuidics allows to increase the efﬁciency
of bioprocess. In the recent review, Jansen concludes that end-
to-end fabrication and on-demand manufacturing based on
microreactors have growing industrial interest, which leads
to development and progress [14]. However, coupling mi-
croreactors and biocatalysis is highly complex, requiring an
integrated approach addressing biocatalyst features, reaction
kinetics, mass transfer and microreactors geometry [13][15].

Mathematical models have been widely used to investigate
the kinetic peculiarities of the enzyme microreactors [8][13].
Models coupling the enzyme-catalysed reaction with the diffu-
sion in enzyme microreactors are usually used. Since contain-
ing catalytic particles, the analyte in CSTR is well-stirred and
set in powerful motion, the mass transport by diffusion outside
the microreactors is usually neglected [15][16]. Mixing within
CSTR creates the Nernst layer while increasing stirrer speed
can reduce the thickness of Nernst layer. However, due to the
inner force of attraction, the zero thickness of the diffusion
shell (layer) can not be achieved [17]. We consider an array of
identical spherical microreactors placed in the CSTR shown
in Figure 1 [7], where area Ωm denotes a microreactor, Ωd
denotes surrounding diffusion shell and Ωc is a convective
region.
The goal of this work was to investigate the dependencies
of the internal and external diffusion limitations on the yield
and the effectiveness factors, modelled by reaction-diffusion
equations, containing a non-linear term related to Michaelis-
Menten kinetics [7][8][18]. The model involves three regions:
the enzyme microreactor, where the enzyme reaction, as well
as the mass transport by diffusion take place, a diffusion
limiting region, where only the mass transport by diffusion
takes place, and a convective region, where the constant
analyte concentration is maintained. In practice, the laboratory
experiments aimed to be performed with as small as possible
particle layer size to avoid process limitations caused by
diffusion of the reacting solution in the catalyst pore system.
There is a practice of performing experiments under the ﬂuid-
dynamic conditions in order to eliminate the lack of mass
transfer liminations outside the particles. However, it is not
always possible to reduce the particle size as much as it is
required for avoiding diffusion limitations.
It has been shown that for ﬁrst order chemical reactions, the
transient effectiveness factor depends not only on the Thiele
modulus but also on the adsorption capacity of the system,
the fact that should be taken into account when kinetic ex-
periments are designed. However, the type of immobilization
can raise the diffusion difference within the reactor and the
Nernst layer. The porous materials as well as nanoparticles
immobilized in mircoreactors, can be considered porous with
respect to the Nernst layer. This paper also analyses how
the porosity impacts effectiveness factor as well as the yield
factor. Due to a strong non-linearity of the reaction term, the
computer simulation was carried out using the ﬁnite difference
technique [19].
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: in Section
II, the mathematical model and microbioreactor characteristics
are described; Section III formulates a dimensionless model
and determines the main parameters of the bioreactor; Section
IV describes the numerical model and the simulator; in Section
V, the results of numerical experiments are presented, and
conclusions close the article.

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL
We consider an array of identical spherical microreactors
placed in a continuous ideally stirred-tank reactor [7]. Assum-
ing a uniform distribution of the microreactors (see Figure
2) in the tank and a comparably great distance between
adjacent microreactors and fact that microreactor volume Vm
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the tank volume V , the spherical
unit cell was modelled by an enzyme-loaded microreactor
(pellet) and a surrounding diffusion shell (the Nernst diffusion
layer). The principal structure of the tank containing uniformly
distributed microreactors and a unit cell are presented in
Figure 1, where Ωm denotes a microreactor (MR), Ωd stands
for the diffusion shell and Ωc is a convective region.
In the enzyme-loaded MR layer we consider the enzyme-
catalyzed reaction

the substrate (S) combines reversibly with an enzyme (E) to
form a complex (ES). The complex then dissociates into the
product (P) and the enzyme is regenerated [20][21]. The kf,
kr and kcat are forward rate, reverse rate and catalytic rate
constanst, respectively.
Assuming the steady-state approximation, the concentration
of the intermediate complex (ES) does not change and may
be neglected when modelling the biochemical behaviour of the
microreactor [7][21][22]. In the resulting scheme, the substrate
(S) is enzymatically converted to the product (P),

A. Governing Equations
Considering the symmetrical geometry of the microreactor
and homogenised distribution of the immobilized enzyme
inside the porous microreactor, the mathematical model can
be described in one-dimensional domain using the radial
distance [7].
Coupling enzymatic reaction in the microreactor (region
Ωm) with the one-dimensional-in-space diffusion, described
by Fick’s second law, and considering the steady-state of a
system (2) leads to the following governing equations of the
reaction-diffusion type (0 < r < R0):

(3b)
r stands for space variable, Sm = Sm(r) and Pm = Pm(r)
are the concentrations of the substrate and the reaction product
in the microreactor, respectively, R0 is the radius of the
microreactor, Vmax = kcatE0 is the maximal enzymatic rate
and KM = (kr + kcat)/kf is the Michaelis constant. The
volumetric reaction as a function from concentration is marked
as V (S) = VmaxSm/(KM + Sm).
In the Nernst diffusion layer Ωd only the mass transport by
diffusion takes place (R0 < r < R1):

Sd = Sd(r) and Pd = Pd(r) are the concentrations of
the substrate and the reaction product in the diffusion shell.
Respectively, DS,d and DP,d are the diffusion coefﬁcients of
the materials in the bulk solution and R1 is the radius of the
unit cell.
Microbioreactors are microparticles immobilized with the
enzyme, so the core of the particle is porous. Due to the
porosity of microbioreactor diffusion coefﬁcients DS,m and
DP,m can be expressed through diffusion coefﬁcients for bulk
solution [23],
DS,m

(5b)
ϵt is porosity (void fraction space in a material) and τ is
tortuosity.
B. Boundary Conditions
Fluxes of the substrate and the product through the stagnant
external diffusion shell is assumed to be equal to the corre-
sponding ﬂuxes entering the surface of the microreactor,

speciﬁcity of concentration distribution of the compounds
between two neighboring regions [7][24],

The partition within the reactor caused by porosity, so we
assume that the porosity and partition coefﬁcient is in a linear
relationship:

Due to the symmetry of the microreactor, the zero-ﬂux
boundary conditions are deﬁned for the center of the microre-
actor (r = 0),

(9b)
According to the Nernst approach, the shell of thickness ν =
R1−R0 remains unchanged with time [17][19]. Away from it,
the solution is in motion and is uniform in concentration. Due
to the continuous injection of the substrate into the stirred
tank and washing off the product, the concentration in the
convective region remains unchanged:
Sd(R1)
=
S0,
(10a)
Pd(R1)
=
0.
(10b)
The thickness ν of the Nernst diffusion shell depends on the
nature and stirring up of the buffer solution. Usually, more
intensive stirring corresponds to the thinner diffusion layer
(shell).
C. Microbioreactor characteristics
In many industrial processes, especially in the production
of low-value added products like biopesticides, bio-fertilizers,
bio-surfactants ect. [10], it is important to continuously im-
prove the yield and/or productivity of the reactor system [8].
The productivity is important, since this ensures an efﬁcient
utilization of the production capacity, i.e., the bioreactors.
The yield of the desired product on the substrate is one
of the most important criteria for design and optimization
of bioreactors. The economic feasibility of the process is
expressed by the yield factor as the ratio of product formation
rate and the substrate uptake rate [7][8].
The bioreactor construction is efﬁcient enough when the
product emission is relatively large with given substrate
amount used. The product emission rate ¯EP,O can be cal-
culated by an integration of the product ﬂux over the outer
surface of the diffusion shell [8],

The product emission rate has the units of mol/s.
The substrate consumption rate ¯CS over the whole microre-

(12)
The substrate emission rate also have the units of mol/s.
The yield factor γ for the microreactor system, as well as for
the entire tank reactor shown in Figure 1, can be deﬁned by the
ratio of the product emission rate to the substrate consumption
rate,
γ =
¯EP,O
¯CS
.
(13)
The yield factor is characterised by an actual rate within the
reactor in contrast to the actual product formation rate.
The effectiveness factors characterise the interaction be-
tween action in microbioreactor in porous catalytic pellets and
microreactors when particles are solid
[25], and often used
in the biochemical engineering [26][27]. The effectiveness
factors are usually deﬁned in terms of the stationary mode
of biocatalytic systems [25][27][28]. The effectiveness factor
η can be calculated [29]:

(14)
Summarising deﬁnition (14), the effectiveness factor η can
be deﬁned also as the ratio of the average reaction rate
actually observed in the MR to ideal rate evaluated at the
bulk concentrations of the substrate [29][30].
III. DIMENSIONLESS MODEL
In order to deﬁne the main governing parameters of the
two compartment model (3)-(10), the dimensional variable r
and unknown concentrations Sm(r), Pm(r), Sd(r), Pd(r) are
replaced with the following dimensionless parameters:
er = r
R0
,
eSm = Sm
KM
ePm = Pm
KM
,
eSd = Sd
KM
,
ePd = Pd
KM
,
(15)
er is the dimensionless distance from the microreactor center
and eSm(er), ePm(er), eSd(er), ePd(er) are the dimensionless con-
centrations. Having deﬁned dimensionless variables and un-
knowns, the following dimensionless parameters characterize
the domain geometry and the substrate concentration in the
bulk:
eν = ν
R0
,
eS0 = S0
KM
,
D = τ
ϵt
(16)
eν is the dimensionless thickness of the Nernst diffusion layer,
eS0 is the dimensionless substrate concentration in the bulk
solution, D is the dimensionless diffusion coefﬁcient. The
dimensionless thickness of the microreactor equals one.

can be easily integrated (1 < er < 1 + eν) [19],
eSd(er) = c1

ePd(er) = d1
er + d2,
(24)
c1, c2, d1 and d2 are constants of integration. By evaluating
the integration constants from the boundary conditions (20)
and (23), we get the following solution to the system (19):

(27)
The boundary value problem (17)-(23) has been reduced
to the boundary value problem described by the governing
equations (17), the boundary condition (22) and the ﬂux
boundary condition (26).
C. Governing parameters
The initial set of model parameters has been reduced to the
following aggregate dimensionless parameters: eν is the relative
thickness of the Nernst diffusion layer, σ is the diffusion
module, β is the Biot number, eS0 is the substrate concentration
in the bulk, φ is the formal partition coefﬁcient.
The dimensionless factor σ2 essentially compares the rate
of enzyme reaction (Vmax/KM) with the diffusion through
the enzyme-loaded microreactor (DS,m/R2
0). If σ2 ≪ 1, the
enzyme kinetics controls the bioreactor action. The action is
under diffusion control when σ2 ≫ 1.
The Biot number indicates the internal mass transfer resis-
tance to the external one [33][34]. When the Biot number is
small, the effect of the external diffusion is the most marked.
As the Biot number increases, the effect of the external
diffusion becomes less important.
The diffusion module and the Biot number are widely
used in analysis and design of different bioreactors [34].
The experiment conducted by Kont et al. [11] proved the
external mass-transfer limitations to be negligible for the Biot
number greater than one using the ﬁrst order kinetics model
of CSTR and packed-bed reactors (PBR), which corresponds
condition (10). Typically, designers seek for bioreactors acting
in the reaction-limited regime, since in this case reaction and
diffusion occur on different time scales [35].
D. Limiting cases
Analytical solutions of product and substrate concentrations
can be found for the limiting cases when volumetric reactions
become zero or ﬁrst kinetics [7][33]. Analytical solutions have
practical value, the models when diffusion is not ﬁxed and
depends on porosity and tortuosity are rarely analyzed (see
equation (5)).
Zero order kinetics: When the substrate concentration S0
is very high compared to the Michaelis constant KM (S0 ≫
KM), the reaction term reduces to the zero order reaction rate
Vmax, then volumetric reactions becomes V (S) ≈ Vmax.
The solution of substrate and product concentrations with
the boundary conditions (6)-(10) gives the following expres-

The zero order kinetics rate does not depend on the concen-
tration proﬁles, so, naturally, such type of system is efﬁcient.
First order kinetics: At such low concentration of the
substrate as S0
≪ KM, the non-linear reaction rate in
equations (3) reduces to the ﬁrst order reaction rate, then
volumetric reactions becomes V (S) ≈ VmaxS/KM.
The solution of substrate and product concentrations with

One can see that the effectiveness coefﬁcient lies in the interval
[0, 1], while yield can grow. However, in practical applications
σ ≪ 1.
IV. DIGITAL SIMULATION OF EXPERIMENTS
The non-linearity of the governing equations prevents us
from solving the boundary value problem (17)-(23) analyti-
cally, hence the numerical model was constructed and solved
using ﬁnite difference technique [19]. An explicit scheme was
used; however, due to Michaelis-Menten non-linearity, further
construction of equations was used:

C = S, P. Tridiagonal matrix was constructed from the
equations. In the numerical simulation, the scheme was run
until the following loss became very small:
L = ||Sn − Sn−1||l2 + ||P n − P n−1||l2 < ϵ,
decay rate value ϵ = 10−14 was used over l2 norm. An explicit
scheme of ﬁnite difference was built on a uniform discrete grid
with 128 points in space direction [18]. The simulator has been
programmed by the authors in C++ language [36].
The numerical solution of the mathematical model (17)-(23)
was validated by using the exact analytical solutions known
for very special cases of the model parameters [7][18][31][34]
see equations (28)-(37).
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effects of the geometry and catalytic
activity of the microreactor, the reactor action was simulated
and the yield and the effectiveness factor was calculated for
very different values of the Biot number β, the Thiele module
σ, the substrate dimensionless concentration S0, the porosity
ϵt.
A. Concentration proﬁles
Figure 3 shows the proﬁles of the product concentration
P calculated from the microreactor model (17)-(23) changing
the Biot number β and the porosity equal ϵt = 0.75. Figure 4
shows the proﬁles of the substrate concentration S changing
the Thiele module σ and the porosity ϵt = 1. As both ﬁgures
demonstrate, the following parameters of the model remain
unchanged:
DS,d = DP,d, β = 1,
eν = 1.
(40)
One can be seen in Figure 4, where low Thiele modulus
values σ < 1, which indicates that the species pass the Nernst
diffusion layer fast, allow the concentrations approach the
straight line because of linearity of governing equations in the
area er ∈ (1, 1 + eν). On the other hand, high Thiele modulus
values (σ ≥ 100) (see Figure 3) lead to signiﬁcant differences
in concentration distribution across the outer boundary of the
microreactor. Both the radius of dimensionless microreactor
and the Nerst layer thickness is equal to one.
B. The impact of the Biot number, Thiele module and substrate
concentration
To investigate the dependence of the yield factor γ, the
effectiveness factor η on the Biot number β, changing the
Biot number in a range of [1, 102], the factor γ was calculated
at different values of the Thiele module σ in a range of
[10−1, 102] and the substrate concentration eS0 was calculated
in a range of [10−3, 103].
Impact of the Biot number: The results of the calculations
of yield factor γ when Biot number β and Thiele module σ
is changing and the porosity ϵt = 0.1, 0.5, 1 are depicted in
Figure 5.

In Figure 5, the yield factor γ is presented when concentra-
tion eS0 is equal to one. It is apparent that maximal efﬁciency
can be achieved only with Thiele module σ < 1. It is worth to
mention that porosity can be considered as neglected for yield
factor. With large values of Thiele module, the yield factor γ
is nearing to zero independently of the porosity ϵt or β. The
yield factor γ, practically, does not depend on β for σ < 1.
The Biot number and substrate concentration is neglected
to yield factor γ with Thiele module σ < 20. On the other
hand, the Nernst diffusion layer may be neglected when the
Biot number is higher than approximately 20 [34][37].
Impact of the substrate concentration: Calculation results
of the yield factor γ when substrate concentration S0 and
Thiele module σ is changing and the porosity ϵt = 0.1, 0.5, 1
are depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 6. The yield factor γ vs. Thiele module σ and initial concentration
S0 at porosity ϵt: 0.1, 0.5, 1, the other parameters are as in (40).
One can see (Figure 6) a non-linear impact of the substrate
concentration on the yield factor. As a function of eS0, the
yield factor γ is a monotonously increasing function with the
limit of one. At high values of the Thiele module σ > 20, the
yield factor is decreasing to zero near low values of substrate
(see Figure 6). The yield factor, limiting value of one, can be
reached with the low Thiele module values σ < 20.
The yield factor γ is, practically, invariant to changes in
the substrate concentration eS0 when the Michaelis-Menten
kinetics approach the ﬁrst order (eS0 ≪ 1) or zero order
kinetics (eS0
≫ 1). In intermediate values of eS0, when
the kinetics changes from the ﬁrst to zero order, the yield
factor γ noticeably increases with increasing the substrate
concentration at low Thiele module values.
Impact of the Thiele Module: It can be seen in Figure 5
and Figure 6 that the yield factor γ, practically, does not
depend on σ and approaches to one when the bioreactor acts
notably under the bioreaction control (σ < 20). At mixed
conditions when the diffusion action is inﬂuenced by both
the enzyme kinetics and the diffusion, the yield factor γ
noticeably decreases decreasing the substrate concentration S0.
Figure 6 also shows that the factor γ increases while increasing
the substrate concentration (as in Figure 6) as well as when
increasing the Biot number β (as in Figure 5).
C. Impact of the porosity
To investigate the dependence of the yield factor γ, the
effectiveness factor η on porosity ϵt, the calculations were
performed in a range of [0.1, 1]. The ranges of Thiele module
σ, Biot number β and tortuosity was used as in the previous
Section.
Figure 7 shows the effectiveness factor η as an increasing
function of the porosity ϵt when Thiele module is one and
Biot number is two. When the Michaelis-Menten kinetics
approaches the ﬁrst order (eS0 ≪ 1), the effectiveness factor
η becomes a linear function from the porosity. The effective-
ness factor η approaches one as increased concentrations are
becoming zero order kinetics (eS0 ≫ 1). Those limits can be
validated from calculated factors at zero order (33) and the
ﬁrst order kinetics (39).

tions are equal to one. The effectiveness factor η, practically,
does not depend on the Biot number for β > 2 and increases
with increasing the porosity and the Biot number.

Figure 9 shows the yield γ as an increasing function of the
porosity ϵt when concentrations are equal to one and the Biot
number is two. It is evident that high Thiele module values
σ ≫ 10 are signiﬁcantly descreasing any efﬁciency of the
system and the yield factor practicaly does not depend on the
porosity ϵt. On the other hand, the small Thiele module values
give a linear dependency from the porosity. It can be noted
that yield as a function of Thiele module is nonlinear and
increases with decreasing diffusion module.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The mathematical model (3)-(10) and the corresponding
dimensionless model (15)-(23) of the microbioreactor can be
successfully used to investigate the behaviour of the catalytic
microreactor and to optimize its conﬁguration.
The yield of the product increases with increasing the
substrate concentration (Figure 6) and with decreasing the
Thiele module (Figure 5). However, the effectiveness of the
yield factor can be achieved to the limit of one, with not high
Thiele module value σ < 20. More importantly, the yield
factor, practically, does not depend on the Biot number (Figure
5) and the porosity (Figure 10).
The increase in the substrate concentration becomes inef-
fective when the enzyme reaction is under control of reaction
control σ < 20 (Figure 6). The high yield can be achieved
only when the enzyme kinetics controls the bioreactor action
σ < 20 (Figure 6).
The transient effectiveness factor is an increasing function
of porosity and, practically, does not depend on the Biot
number (Figure 8). However, strong non-linear depencies
appear when analysing the impact of porosity and Thiele
module (Figure 9). Also, is evident that the effectiveness factor
approach zero under diffusion control σ > 10 and is limited
of porosity under action control σ < 0.1. The dependency
from substrate concentration (Figure 7) also shows a non-linear
relationship. The effectiveness increases to one with increase
in the substrate concentration and reduces to the linear function
of porosity when S0 < 0.01.
Such formulation can be useful to ﬁnd the optimal parame-
ters of such biosystem construction [12]. More importantly, it
might improve the design and production of microbioreactors.
There are some limitations worth to mention that might
be used for the future investigations. First of all, in physical
experiments, pellets can not be considered as the perfect
spheres, which requires the modelling of more sophisticated
domains in 2D and 3D spaces. Secondly, the system with time
dependent characteristics should be considered in the future
work.
