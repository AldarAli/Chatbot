Abstract—Small cells are expected to play an important role 
in future mobile networks. In such environments, proper 
handling of handoff traffic is of major importance. In this paper, 
we propose the single-threshold model for the analysis of handoff 
traffic in cellular CDMA networks. Based on this model, we are 
able to determine analytically the uplink blocking probabilities of 
handoff and new calls. This is done by describing the CDMA 
system as a Discrete-Time Markov Chain and by deriving an 
efficient recursive formula for the calculation of system state 
probabilities. The proposed analytical model is verified via 
simulation studies.  
Keywords—handoff; cdma; call blocking probability; recursive 
formula. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques 
have been used in the current generation mobile networks and 
are expected to play an important role in future 5G networks. 
Some of the advantages of CDMA-based techniques over other 
competing technologies include enhanced security, efficient 
frequency spectrum utilization, and improved signal quality.  
According 
to 
the 
traditional 
cellular 
model, 
the 
geographical area is divided into cells, and each of them is 
controlled by a Base Station (BS).  Different BSs communicate 
with each other through the core network (usually fixed and 
wired). Although, in future mobile networks it is envisioned 
the introduction of intelligent BSs that will be able to 
communicate directly with each other for both signalling and 
data traffic [1]. Mobile Users (MUs), located in the same or 
different cells, communicate with each other through the 
corresponding BSs. The communication link from MUs to BS 
is referred to as uplink, whereas the communication link from 
BS to MUs is referred to as downlink. Due to non-
orthogonality of the CDMA codes, a new MU arriving to a cell 
will cause interference to other MUs in the same and 
neighbouring cells. Therefore, Call Admission Control (CAC) 
is performed upon a call arrival, in order to protect the Quality-
of-Service (QoS) of existing MUs. This may result in the 
blocking of the newly arriving call.  
In this work, we consider two types of call blocking: new-
call blocking and handoff-call blocking. The first type refers to 
the call blocking upon the initial connection establishment, 
whereas the second type refers to the blocking of already 
accepted in-service calls when they move from one cell to 
another. The procedure of moving between neighbouring cells, 
while a call is in progress, is called handoff. The CAC policy is 
expected to guarantee that the handoff-call blocking probability 
will be significantly lower than that of the new-call blocking.  
In this paper, we model a cellular CDMA system as a 
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC). Our analysis is based 
on the classical Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) [2], [3] 
and its extension for single-threshold model [4], [5], which has 
been proposed for wired connection-oriented networks. We 
extend [2]-[5] by considering the handoff traffic and soft 
network capacity of CDMA systems.   
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present 
the literature review. In Section III, we describe our proposed 
model for cellular CDMA systems. In Section IV, we present a 
detailed calculation of local blocking probabilities. In Section 
V, we derive equations for an efficient calculation of call 
blocking probabilities. In Section VI, we study the performance 
of the proposed approach by means of computer simulations. 
We conclude and discuss our future work in Section VII. 
 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Many important teletraffic models have been proposed for 
the determination of new-call blocking probabilities in cellular 
CDMA networks [6]-[18]. In [6], the call blocking calculation 
in the uplink of a W-CDMA cell is based on an extension of 
the EMLM. The authors assume that calls arrive in the system 
according to a Poisson process. This work was extended in [7], 
by incorporating elastic and adaptive traffic, and in [8], [9] by 
considering a quasi-random call arrival process. In [10], an 
efficient CAC scheme for CDMA systems has been proposed 
and evaluated. In [11], the authors propose an analytical model 
13

for multi-service cellular networks servicing multicast 
connections. An extension of [8] has been proposed in [12] to 
model elastic and adaptive traffic. A different approach that 
includes interference cancellation has been proposed in [13]-
[15]. In [16], the authors evaluate the performance of W-
CDMA systems with different QoS requirements. In [17], a 
teletraffic model for a W-CDMA cell with finite number of 
channels and finite number of traffic sources is presented. This 
model has been extended in [18] to provide equalization of call 
congestion probabilities among different service-classes.           
Some of the aforementioned models have been extended 
for the analysis of handoff-call blocking probabilities [19]-[22]. 
In [19], a model for W-CDMA systems with a soft handoff 
mechanism has been proposed. In [20], the model of [8] has 
been extended for the calculation of handoff-call blocking 
probabilities. In [21] and [22], the model of [6] has been 
enhanced with a CAC for handoff traffic. While most of the 
works concentrate on the uplink, a few papers study the 
downlink of CDMA systems as well [23], [24].  
In this paper, we concentrate on the uplink of cellular 
CDMA systems and handoff traffic. In particular, we extend 
[21] by enabling two contingency bandwidth requirements of 
the arriving calls. If the system is heavily loaded (above a 
predefined threshold), then the call will request less bandwidth 
compared with the case of lightly loaded systems.    
 
III. 
MODEL DESCRIPTION 
Consider a CDMA system that supports K independent 
service-classes. We examine a reference cell surrounded by 
neighbouring cells in the uplink direction (calls from MUs to 
BS). 
The following QoS parameters characterize a service-class 
k  (k=1,…, K) new call: 
 
R ,k N
 : Transmission bit rate. 
 
0
,
(
/
)
b
k N
E
N
: Bit error rate (BER) parameter. 
The offered traffic-load (in erl) of service-class k  new calls 
is Poisson and denoted as 
a ,k N
. For our analysis, we express 
later in the paper the different service’s QoS requirements as 
different resource/bandwidth requirements.  
In a similar way, the QoS parameters of a service-class k  
handoff call are defined as: 
 
R ,k H
 : Transmission bit rate. 
 
0
,
(
/
)
b
k H
E
N
: BER parameter. 
 The offered traffic-load (in erl) of service-class k  handoff 
calls is denoted as 
a ,k H
.We assume perfect power control. 
That is, at the BS, the received power from each service-class k 
call is the same and equal to k
P . Recall that in CDMA systems 
all MUs transmit within the same frequency band. Therefore, 
signals generated by MUs cause interference to each other. We 
distinguish the intra-cell interference, 
Iintra
, caused by users 
of the reference cell and the inter-cell interference, 
Iinter
, 
caused by users of the neighbouring cells. We also consider the 
existence of the thermal noise, 
N
P , which corresponds to the 
interference of an empty system. 
The CAC in CDMA systems is performed by measuring 
the noise rise, NR, defined as the ratio of the total received 
power at the BS, total
I
, to the thermal noise power, 
N
P   [6]:

                       (1) 
When a new call arrives, the CAC estimates the noise rise 
and if it exceeds a maximum value, 
NRmax
, the new call is 
blocked and lost.  
A 
service-class 
k 
call 
alternates 
between 
active 
(transmitting) and passive (silent) periods. This behavior is 
described by the activity factor, 
kv , which represents the 
fraction of the call’s active period over the entire service time 
( 0
1
 kv
 ). Users that at a time instant occupy system 
resources are referred to as active users.  
The cell load, n, is defined as the ratio of the received 
power from all active users (at the reference or neighbouring 
cells) to the total received power:

the noise rise and the cell load:

We define the maximum value of the cell load,
nmax
, as the 
cell load that corresponds to the maximum noise rise, 
NRmax
. 
A typical value in W-CDMA systems is 
max
0.8
n

and it can 
be considered as the shared system resource [6].  
The load factor, 
L ,k N
, given in (4) can be considered as 
the resource/bandwidth requirement of a service-class k new 
call:

The cell load, n, can be written (see (7) below) as the sum 
of the intra-cell load,

 (cell load that derives from the 
active users of the reference cell), and the inter-cell load, 
ninter
 (cell load that derives from the active users of the

In this work, we adopt the following CAC condition at the 
BS in order to decide whether to accept a new service-class 
k call or not:

Similarly, the condition for the acceptance of a handoff

IV. 
LOCAL BLOCKING PROBABILITIES 
Due to the condition of (8), the probability that a new 
service-class k call is blocked when arriving at an instant with 
intra-cell load, 
nintra
, is called Local Blocking Probability 
(LBP) and can be calculated by [21]:

In order to calculate the LBP of (10) we can use (4)-(7). We 
notice that the only unknown parameter is the inter-cell 
interference, 
Iinter
. Similarly to [21], we model 
Iinter
as a 
lognormal random variable (with parameters 
I
 and 
I
 ), that 
is independent of the intra-cell interference. Hence, the mean, 
[
E Iinter ]
, and the variance, 
[
Var Iinter ]
, of inter
I
are calculated 
by (12) and (13):

STATE AND CALL BLOCKING PROBABILITIES

As stated before, in CDMA networks the cell load can be 
considered as a shared system resource and the load factor as 
the resource requirement of a call. Thus, we can use a

of 
the 
Kaufman-Roberts 
recursion 
(K-R 
recursion) used for the determination of the link occupancy 
distribution in the EMLM [3], [4], for the calculation of state 
probabilities in CDTM systems. Below we present five steps 
needed for the modification.  
The discretization of the cell load, n, and the load factor,

We denote by c the total number of occupied b.u. at an

if all users were active. The parameter j at a given moment is 
considered as the system state. 
We also denote by q(j) the probability of the state j. The

The threshold

J is used for the selection of the bandwidth 
requirement of an arriving service-class k handoff call. In 
particular, if 
k
j > J , then the requested bandwidth is

B. Call Blocking Probabilities 
The new-call blocking probabilities of service-class k can 
be calculated by adding all the state probabilities multiplied by

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we compare the analytical versus simulation 
results in respect of call blocking probabilities. The simulation 
language used is Simscript III [25]. We present analytical and 
simulation results for both types of calls, new and handoff. 
Simulation results are mean values of 10 runs with 95% 
confidence interval. The resultant reliability ranges of the 
simulation measurements are very small and, therefore, we 
present only mean values.  
We evaluate two different service-classes with the 
following parameters:

, for new and handoff calls, 
respectively. We generate traffic load according to the Table I. 
That is, in the case of the 1st service-class the traffic-load point 
1 corresponds to 
1,
1.0erl
a N

and 
1,
0.1erl

for the new 
and handoff calls, respectively.  
In Figs. 1 and 2, we present the analytical and simulation 
call blocking probabilities for the 1st and the 2nd service-class, 
respectively. We observe that the accuracy of the proposed 
model is very good, since the analytical results are very close 
to simulation results in all cases. We also observe that by using 
different cell load thresholds for new and handoff calls 
(
N
H
n
 n
), we achieve lower blocking probabilities for the 
handoff calls.

 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have presented a new teletraffic model for 
the analysis of handoff traffic in cellular CDMA systems. The 
proposed approach is based on a single-threshold model that 
allows the handoff call request less bandwidth when the 
system is overloaded. In that case, the handoff-call blocking 
probability can be reduced. We have performed simulation 
studies, which show that the accuracy of our proposed 
analytical model is very satisfactory. As a future work, we will 
study the impact of multiple thresholds on the blocking 
probabilities of handoff calls. Also, we will incorporate a 
finite number of traffic sources into our model.
