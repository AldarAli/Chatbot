Abstract—Visible Light Communications (VLC) can play an
important role in the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems
(C-ITS) by enabling vehicles to communicate with nearby vehicles
(V2V) and infrastructure (V2I) by offering virtually unlimited
and unregulated spectrum. Whereas extensive R&D efforts have
been made on physical layer techniques, almost no study has been
made on Multi-Users Interference (MUI), consequently Medium
Access Control (MAC), in VLC. This work sheds light on the
impacts of MUI on VLC performances for V2V communications.
We ﬁrst develop an analytical model that formulates the Packet
Delivery Ratio (PDR) performances of VLC communication in
presence of MUI. We then conduct simulation evaluations to
conﬁrm the analytical model and evaluate the VLC performance
when there is one or more interfering nodes. The obtained results
clearly show that, in an absence of MAC, VLC can suffer from
MUI in medium to dense trafﬁc density even when message
generation rate at each node is relately low.

INTRODUCTION
The key objective of C-ITS is to improve road safety
and trafﬁc efﬁciency by enabling vehicles and infrastructure
to exchange information via Vehicle to Vehicle/Infrastructure
communication (V2X). Radio communications technologies,
particularly 802.11p and 4G/5G are considered to be the
key players by providing omni-directional medium to long
distance communications, allowing vehicles and roadside in-
frastructure communicate directly with each other (V2V or
V2I) or through a network (V2N). Whereas radio commu-
nication technologies are probably the de-facto choice for
a great number of C-ITS applications, due to the limited
radio resource and their vulnerability against security attacks,
there is a need for complementary technology especially for
applications that require 100% of reliability and strong cyber-
security protection. Indeed applications particularly those for
automated driving have extremely strict requirements in terms
of reliability and security. One of such applications having
such stringent requirements is vehicle platooning in which,
V2V communication between platoon members are required
for longitudinal and lateral controls avoiding chain instability
problem. Because the information is to control vehicles, the
information exchange has to be extremely reliable and secure.
Targeting applications, such as vehicles platooning, a great
number of researchers suggest VLC for V2V as a comple-
mentary solution to radio communications as shown in Figure
1, [1]–[5]. VLC uses the visible light spectrum (wavelengths
between 780 nm to 375 nm) as communication media. VLC
is a fast, safe and cheap technology, since it is implemented
directly using vehicle headlights and taillights. Moreover, the
usage of Light Emitter Diodes (LED) instead of a xenon or
halogen bulb, has a number of beneﬁts such as long useful
life, low power consumption, high tolerance to environmental
conditions, and high efﬁciency [6]. Finally, since radio and
light communications do not interfere with each other, and
hence VLC can perfectly co-exist and complement radio
communications.
Indeed, IEEE provides the possibility to deploy VLC by
specifying VLC standards: 802.15.7 [7] and 802.15.7r1 [8],
which are published in 2011 and in 2018, respectively, and
the ongoing work on IEEE 802.11bb [9]. The standard IEEE
802.15.7 and its revision 802.15.7r1 have a strong focus
physical layer conﬁgurations of VLC for both indoor and
outdoor LED to photodiode (PD) or LED to camera VLC
communications. Concerning the MAC, the standards basically
carried over the solutions of Wireless Personal Area Networks
(WPAN). On the other hand, the aim of IEEE 802.11bb [9] is
to integrate Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) solutions
to Light Fidelity communication (LiFi). In adding to the above-
mentioned standardisation efforts, a great number of R&D
studies have been carried out proposing VLC as a candidate
technology for enhanced reliability and security for V2X
communications. The majority of the efforts however focuses
on the physical layer design of VLC proposing modulation
schemes, ﬁltering strategies, etc. [10]–[12]. Some real-world
demonstrations of VLC prototypes for V2V communication
have been also made [1], [2], [12]. In contrast to the volu-
minous literature on physical layer solutions, very few efforts

are made on medium access control for VLC [13]–[16]. Most
importantly, because VLC is directional and requiring Line
Of Sight (LOS) condition, one may even doubt about MUI in
VLC, and hence neglecting the importance of MAC.
To the best of our knowledge, the current work is the only
work that studies the impact of MUI in VLC. In this paper,
we ﬁrst develop analytical models that formulate the size of
MUI zone in V2V VLC. We then further develop a model
of PDR in VLC in presence of MUI, when vehicles’ density
follows the Poisson distribution. Finally, by using computer
simulations, we validate the correctness of the theoretical
model and evaluate the VLC performance in presence of MUI.
The results clearly show that PDR can quickly degrade down
to few % for medium to dense roads.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II highlights
the related work. We develop an analytical model on impacts
of MUI on V2V VLC in Section III. Section IV validates the
analytical model and evaluates the PDR performance of VLC
up to 3- and 7-lanes of highway scenarios with sparse to dense
trafﬁc density. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
The majority of the existing standardisation and R&D
efforts on VLC are to advance physical layer design of VLC.
IEEE 802.15.7 standard speciﬁed three PHY modes PHY-I,
II, and III, where PHY-I is intended to outdoor applications
utilizing On-Off Keying (OOK) and Variable Pulse Position
Modulation (VPPM) coding schemes, which are relatively
robust in harsh outdoor environments. The authors of [10],
[11] demonstrated different modulation schemes for transmis-
sion (Manchester, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex-
ing (OFDM), Miller, etc.), and complex ﬁltering strategies
for reception. A. Belle et al. [17] presented a VLC prototype
of IEEE 807.15.7 that extending their previous work [18] on
IEEE 802.15.4 [19]. The authors developed software libraries
for PHY and zigbee MAC, which is not speciﬁcally designed
for VLC. Q. Wang et al. [20] evaluated VLC performances,
using a VLC platform, in terms of communication speed,
communication distance, and low power LED/PD saturation
in outdoor/indoor environments for different types of VLC
systems: high/low power LED to PD or LED to LED. The
authors of [1], proposed to use visible light not only for V2V
communications but also for inter-vehicle distance measure-
ment. Finally, a number of demonstrations using VLC for V2V
communications have been made [1], [2].
In contrast to the great number of efforts made on PHY,
very few works on MAC can be found in the literature. The
authors of [13] studied Carrier Sense Multiple Access with
Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) on top of the physical layer
of speciﬁed by IEEE 802.15.7 [7] with different priority levels
setting (High, Medium, and Low Priorities), which result in
differentiated settings of back-off time, back-off exponent and
contention window sizes. P. Shams, et al. [15] presented a per-
formance evaluation of throughput, delay, power consumption,
collision probability, transmission probability, access probabil-
ity and packet discard probability based on Markov modelling
and MATLAB simulations of IEEE 802.15.7 VLC standard.
The authors of [21] evaluated the service time distribution
of the IEEE 802.15.7 standard using Markov chain model.
The authors also proposed an analytic and semi-analytic ap-
proach of queue modeling. S. Ishihara et al. [14] proposed a

radio and visible light hybrid communication for platooning
applications implementing IEEE 1609.4/802.11p standard for
radio frequency and ALOHA MAC protocol for VLC. None
of the above efforts are based on studies on MUI in VLC,
demonstrating the needs of MAC. Furthermore, the rational
behind the usages of CSMA/CA or ALOHA for VLC, which
is naturally half-duplex and directional communication, is not
clear. This paper is to ﬁll the missing gap, studying MUI
in VLC, presenting the need of MAC, which shall take into
account the VLC properties.
Concerning VLC evaluation tools, Q. Wang et al. [20]
presented a low cost, ﬂexible and open source VLC platform
enabling researchers to develop and test their own VLC
systems. Besides prototyping, researchers can also conduct
simulations. Veins VLC [22], [23] is a simulation framework
that integrates VLC transmitter, receiver, and channel models.
Nevertheless, it misses several important functionalities includ-
ing that transmission power (10mW) cannot be reconﬁgured,
and the noise takes into account only the thermal noise
ignoring environmental noises. For this reasons, in this paper,
we have developed own VLC models using Simulink tool.
To summarize, motivated by the fact that there is no work
studying MUI in VLC, this paper is dedicated to study on MUI
and presents the need of MAC that takes into account the VLC
properties.

MODELING IMPACT OF VLC MULTI-USERS
INTERFERENCE
In this Section, we ﬁrst present a VLC channel model and
then develop an analytical model of a zone, from which no
interference is allowed such that an ongoing VLC communi-
cation is protected. Note that for the sake of simplicity, the
model does not take into account weather condition, sun light
direction and intensity.
A. VLC Channel Model
Intensity Modulation with Direct Detection (IM/DD) is
a commonly used method for optical communications. As
illustrated in Figure 2, the LED emits the modulated signal
m(t), whose intensity is varied in accordance with the data.
After propagating through the wireless channel, the signal x(t)
is collected by the photo-diode (PD) of the receiver. The latter

generates a current, y(t), which is proportional to the power
of the light incident on the active area of the PD.
In order to model such a VLC [1], [2], [24], we ﬁrst need
to express the angular distribution (Ro(φ)) or intensity pattern
generated by the LED:
Ro(φ) =
( (mi+1)
2π
cosmi (φ)
φ ∈ [ −π

Here, mi is the Lambert coefﬁcient related to the LED semi-
angle at half-power φ 1

mi =

.

For the receiver side, its effective reception area (Aeff(ψ)) is
modeled:
Aeff(ψ) =
(
Ar cos (ψ)
0 ≤ ψ ≤ π
2 ,
0
ψ > π

(3)
where, Ar is the active area, collecting the light beams at
angles ψ (see Figure 3).
The wireless optical channel then, can be modeled consid-
ering the wireless link with an array of several LEDs without
optical lenses as the transmitter and a PD as the receiver. The

DC gain (H(φ, ψ)) is expressed as follows for a PD placed at
d distance with an irradiance (φ) and an incidence (ψ) angles

The receiver power Pr, is hence

where, Pt is the transmission power and H0(φ, ψ) is
H0(φ, ψ) =
( Ar(mi+1)Pt

cosmi (φ) cos ψ
0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψc,

.
(7)
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that no error-correction
coding applied. In such a case, as one can neglect the multipath
fading in VLC [25], the ability of correctly decoding the
received signal at the receiver, PDR, depends on the Bit-Error
Rate (BER) and the packet size, L bits [26]:
PDR = (1 − BER)L
.
(8)
The relation between BER and the Signal to Interference Noise
Ratio (SINR) for OOK is expressed as follows [24]
BER = Q(
√
SINR) = Q(

Pr
MUI + N )
,
(9)
where Q function is deﬁned as
Q(z) =
Z ∞
z

√

2 dy
.
(10)
In (9), N is the noise power, which consists of shot noise
and thermal noise, and MUI is the total interference power.
It is obvious that in order to correctly receive the transmitted
data, the received SINR must be higher than a given threshold
(SINRth), which is determined by the modulation scheme.
Pr
MUI + N ≥ SINRth
.
(11)
B. Impact of MUI
For a given pair of intended transmitter and receiver, we
are now interested in determining the geographical zone from
where no interference is allowed, i.e., MUI zone. In another
words, we will calculate the distance from an interfering
node to the intended receiver (dir) that fulﬁlls the following
condition
Pi(dir) ≥ Pr(dtr)
SINRth
− N
,
(12)
where dtr is the distance between the intended transmitter
and the receiver. Pi is the interference power, i.e., the receive
power from the interfering node. Since VLC is directional,
the transmitter and the interfering node (LEDs) have to be in
the Field of View (FoV) of the receiver (PD), respecting the
conditions of irradiance and incidence angles (see Figure 3).
As (12) suggests, we now need to determine the SINR
threshold (SINRth), which depends on the desired commu-
nication quality i.e., the PDR requirement. Since PDR=1 -
PER, we can easily calculate the SINR threshold, using the
equations (8) and (9) for a binary modulation scheme:
SINRth =
 
Q−1(1 − Lp
PDRreq)
!2
.
(13)
Here, Q−1 is the inverse Q function. Calculating (13) for the
packet size of 1000 Bits, we can draw Figure 4, which shows
SINRth (in dB) for different PDR requirements. As can be
seen in the Figure, the SINR threshold sharply increases with
the increase of the PDR threshold, taking 12.47 dB for the
PDR requirement of 90%. We are now ready to determine the
MUI zone for communication between an intended transmitter
and a receiver. Because
Pr
SINRth ≫ N (indeed, we can observe
Pr
SINRth = 1µW while N = 50nW), we can safely ignore N
in (12).. Furthermore, since Pr and Pi are both expressed by

(14)
Since the interfering nodes (as well as the intended transmitter)
have to be in the FoV of the receiver, for a given pair of an
intended transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), the MUI zone is
the circular sector with the radius dir and the central angle

communication on multi-lane straight road, vehicles can be
only on individual lanes. For such a scenario, we now calculate
the lengths of each lane belonging to the MUI zone (see Figure
5). As dir is the distance from the receiver to the limit of the
MUI zone (see (14)), we can assume dir ≫ w, where w is
the lane width, the lengths of individual lanes lk in the MUI
zone (see Figure 5) are
lk = dir − k · w · cot ψ
,
0 ≤ k ≤ n
,
(15)
where n is the number of lanes on the right or left side of the
receiver. The total length of lanes in the MUI zone is then
l = dir +

.
(16)
Here nl (resp. nr) is the number of adjacent lanes on left (resp.
right) side of the receiver.
Figure 6. Simulink models for simulation evaluations.
Targeting an intended transmitter and a receiver are at
dtr distance with the LOS condition, we now calculate the
probability of having interfering vehicles on the lanes in the
MUI zone. More speciﬁcally, we assume that vehicles on a
highway follow Poisson distribution, which is widely used for
highway trafﬁc [27], the probability of ﬁnding i vehicles on
the l length of the road is [28]
P(i, l) = (βl)ie−βl
i!
.
(17)
The communication between the intended transmitter and
receiver will be successful only if none of the interfering
vehicles in the MUI zone accesses the channel at the same
time, i.e.,
Ps =
∞

i=0
P(i, l)(1 − τ)i
.
(18)
Here τ is the channel access probability at individual vehicles.
Assuming that vehicles periodically generate messages (bea-
cons) and letting Ttx be the average packet transmission time,
τ is found as
τ =
Ttx
Tinterval
.
(19)
Here Tinterval is the message generation interval. It should be
noted that, since we ignore shadowing induced by vehicles,
(18) is the minimum success probability.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this Section, we evaluate the impact of MUI on VLC
using both the theoretical and simulation evaluations. For
simulation evaluations, we have developed the models of
VLC transmitter, receiver, and interfering nodes using Mat-
lab/SimuLink. As illustrated in Figure 6, the transmitter and
interfering nodes have a message generator, a Digital to Analog
Converter (DAC), and LEDs. They periodically generate se-
quences of bits, encode them using the Manchester modulation,
and emit the signal using the LEDs. The receiver node has a
PD and an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), and hence tries
to decode the received VLC signals. The simulation parameters
are listed in Table I that are typical values of VLC based on
LEDs to PDs. We ﬁrst evaluate PDR for VLC communications
from the intended transmitter to the receiver in absence of
interfering nodes. Speciﬁcally, the simulations are carried out
targeting on a 7-lane straight road, where the receiver (Rx) is

results, where horizontal and vertical axis are the longitudinal
(i.e., longitudinal distance from the receiver) and the lateral
(i.e., lane number) positions of Tx. The obtained PDR result

expected, the longest communication distance is obtained when
the transmitter is on the same lane as the receiver (i.e., the
lateral distance is 0 meters). Speciﬁcally, 90% of PDR can
be obtained up to 30 meters of longitudinal distance. On the
other hand, when the transmitter is on the right or the left
adjacent lanes, 90% of PDR can be obtained for 2 to 28
meters of longitudinal distances. When the transmitter is on
a second adjacent lane, 90% of PDR can be obtained for

the longitudinal distances between 7 to 26 meters. Finally,
90% of PDR cannot be obtained if the transmitter is a third
adjacent lane. We now evaluate the impact of interference for
the VLC communication. We ﬁx the intended transmitter on
the same lane as the receiver at 29 meters and evaluate PDR
for varying positions of the interfering node. The obtained
results are shown in Figure 8, in which two areas are depicted:
yellow and blue. When the interfering node is in the yellow
area, the PDR performance higher than 90% is not achieved.
In contrast, when the interfering node is in the blue area, the
communication between the intended Tx and Rx is succeeded
having higher than 90% of PDR. The Figure also shows
the analytical result by the red transparent area, which the
MUI zone corresponds to PDRreq = 90% (see 13). As the
ﬁgure shows, the simulation and analytical results match pretty
well. Nevertheless, 10 meters of shift in the longitudinal
direction is observed for the analytical results w.r.t that of
the simulations. This is probably because a bit wider the FoV
angle is used for the simulations. We now evaluate PDR results
between the intended transmitter and the receiver, targeting the
possibility of having more than one interfering vehicle on the
road, and the vehicles density follows the Poisson distribution.

scenarios, respectively. The horizontal axis of the ﬁgures is the

generation rate, τ in (18). Finally, PDR results are depicted
using the color plate. The results clearly show that, if there is
no MUI control, i.e., no MAC, sufﬁcient PDR performances
are achievable only for extremely low trafﬁc density and very
low message generation rate. Particularly, in order to obtain
90% of PDR for the message generation rate of 0.9, the trafﬁc
density has to be lower than 1 and 2 cars/Km for 3-lanes and
7-lanes scenarios respectively. Otherwise, in order to obtain
higher than 90% PDR in 50 cars/km density, the message
generation rate has to be lower than 0.05 and 0.01 for 3- and
7-lanes scenarios, respectively. Although the obtained results
are rather pessimistic ﬁgures, they clearly present a strong need
of MAC protocol for VLC.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have developed an analytical model
determining MUI zone, from which no interference is allowed
for protecting an ongoing visible light V2V communication.
Furthermore, we analytically formulated the PDR performance
of a VLC when the interfering nodes follow the Poisson
distribution. Finally, we have conducted simulation evaluations
using a Simulink model. The model integrates, in adding to
an intended transmitter, one or several interference vehicles,
all of them with the possibility to generate, encode, and send
random messages over the same VLC channel to the target
receiver. Using the channel model for Free Space Optical
(FSO) communications, and integrating the physical and elec-
trical properties of a typically used PD, we have compared the
results obtained by simulation and the developed analytical
model. The simulation results ﬁrst conﬁrm the correctness of
the analytical model on MUI zone. The results further show
that even with low trafﬁc densities and low message generation
rates, the vehicles in the MUI zone can signiﬁcantly degrade
the PDR performance of the target VLC communication and
presenting the inherent necessity of a MAC protocol for V2V
communications. The future work includes an improvement of
the theoretical model by taking into account shadowing effect
by bodies of vehicles. We also conduct study on MAC that is
aware of the presences of vehicles in the MUI zones by e.g.,
introducing two-hop beacons.
