Abstract—In this paper, a new multi-beam high gain 
antenna array for Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting          
(RF-EH) applications in 5G network is presented which consists 
of 4 sub-antenna arrays (2 x 2) in order to increase the gain and 
directivity. The sub-antenna array covers the two 5G network 
bands (3.5 GHz and 26/28 GHz) with gains of 3 dB and 6 dB 
respectively. The proposed antenna array is studied and 
simulated for the 26/28 GHz band. The gain reaches 12 dB at 26 
GHz and 15 dB at 27.5 GHz. The simulated efficiency of this 
antenna is of 78%. The antenna is designed on Teflon glass 
substrate with a relative permittivity of 2.1 and 0.67 mm of 
thickness. It total dimension is of 65 x 55 mm². These gain values 
satisfy the beam forming technology adopted by 5G network. 
Keywords—Antenna array, 5G network, High gain, Beam 
forming. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
 
In 5G network, the communication consists in focusing the 
transmitted power in the direction of the receiver to ensure a 
high quality of data transmission. This technique is known as 
beam forming. The transmission power for the 26/28 GHz 
band must be low to ensure a safe communication on human 
health. To increase the received power, it is mandatory to 
improve the gain of the antennas (in transmission and 
reception). The received power is given by the following Friis 
formula. 
𝑃𝑟 = 𝐺𝑟𝐺𝑡 (
𝜆
4𝜋𝑑)
2
⋅ 𝑃𝑡 
                   (1) 
where 𝐺𝑟𝐺𝑡  antenna gains, 𝑃𝑟𝑃𝑡  transmission and reception 
powers, 𝜆  the wave length and d the distance between 
transmitter and receiver. 
 
The efficiency of RF-EH systems depends on the received 
power. By adopting the multi-beam forming technique, the 
RF_EH system stays operational for several orientation.  
There are several techniques to increase the antenna gain, 
including increasing the size of the antenna [1] and using 
reflectors to concentrate the maximum electromagnetic power 
in a given direction which increases the gain [2]. The best 
technique remains the use of an array antenna which allows to 
considerably improve the gain of the antenna. The main 
challenge for this technique is the miniaturization. Designing 
an antenna array with high gain and optimal size facilitates it 
implementation. 
 
Our work consists in the design and simulation of a multi-
beam antenna array for the 26/28 GHz band of 5G network 
with high gain (12 dB and 15 dB, respectively) and an optimal 
size of 65 x 55 mm² designed on Teflon glass substrate with 
0.67 mm of thickness. Table I presents a comparison between 
the proposed array antenna and other antennas proposed in 
references for the same order of gain and frequency band 
values.

For 26 GHz, the proposed antenna presents six beams 
located at θ (+,-) = 80°, 90° and 100° with a maximum 
directivity of 12.1 dBi for both. For 27.5 GHz, the antenna 
presents 14 beams located at θ(+,-) = 40°, 50°, 70°, 90°, 110°, 
130° and 140°, with a maximum directivity of 15.1 dBi. The 
simulation and optimization have been carried out using CST 
(Computer Simulation Technology) microwave software. 
 
In Section II, the antenna array structures are given with 
all dimensions and details. In Section III, simulations of S11 
parameter and radiation pattern are performed and discussed. 
We conclude the paper in Section IV. 
 
II. ANTENNA DESIGN  
 
The proposed elementary antenna model consists of a 
horizontal dipole antenna with a length of 30 mm and six 
vertical elementary wires forming a sub-antenna array. This 
antenna has been designed on Teflon glass substrate with a  
10

relative permittivity of 2.1 and a thickness of 0.67 mm. A 
microstrip line has been used to feed this antenna with an input 
impedance of 50 Ω. Figure 1 shows the proposed antenna 
model and its dimensions are given in Table II. 
 
TABLE II: ALL ANTENNA DIMENSION IN (mm) 
 
 
The first step of the proposed antenna array design is to 
stack two elementary antennas (of Figure 1) to form a two-
antenna (2 x 1) array, as shown in Figure 2. Table III gives the 
(2 x 1) antenna array dimensions. 
 
TABLE III: (2 x 1) ANTENNA ARRAY DIMENSION IN (mm) 
 
 
The second step is to design the (2 x 2) antenna array. In 
this part, two elementary antennas are added with the goal to 
increase the gain and directivity of the antenna. The challenge 
of this part is the impedance matching. Each antenna has to be 
matched to the equivalent impedance of the other three 
elementary antennas. For this purpose, a quarter-wave lines 
and an open stub are used, as shown in Figure 3. Table IV 
gives the complementary dimensions.

III. SIMULATION AND DISCUSSION 
A. Elementary antenna 
Figure 4 presents the simulated coefficient reflection of 
the elementary antenna (see Figure 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The elementary antenna is well adapted to the two 5G 
bands (3.5 GHz and 28 GHz) with an S11 parameter of -30 dB 
and -27 dB, respectively. 
 
Figure 5 depicts the simulated 3D radiation pattern of the 
elementary antenna for 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The maximum directivity obtained by the proposed 
elementary antenna is 6.5 dBi at 28 GHz and 3 dBi at 3.5 GHz. 
The beam forming technology is adopted by 5G in the 
24/26/28 GHz bands, etc. For this reason, we focus our study 
of the antenna array in the two 26/28 GHz 5G bands. 
 
B. (2 x 1) proposed antenna array 
Figure 6 shows the simulated coefficient reflection of the 
(2 x 1) antenna array (see Figure 2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It can be seen that the proposed (2 x 1) antenna array is 
well adapted to both 26/28 GHz 5G bands, with a S11 of -25 
dB and -30 dB respectively. 
 
Figures 7 and 8 present the simulated radiation pattern of           
(2 x 1) antenna array (E and H) plans, respectively.

It can be noted that the array antenna (2 x 1) is a multi-
beam with a high gain for both bands (26/28 GHz). For 26 
GHz, the antenna has 14 lobes and 12 powerful lobes for 28 
GHz. The maximum gain is of 9.6 dBi and 10.3 dBi, 
respectively for 26 GHz and 28 GHz 5G bands. Table V gives 
all directivity values for each beam.

more adapted to 27.6 GHz band with a S11 of -55 dB, and 
adapted to 26 GHz band with a S11 of -23 dB.

For the 26 GHz and 27.6 GHz frequencies, 6 powerful 
beams are located, 3 in front and 3 in the back of the antenna. 
This allows the antenna to be operational at both sides.  
Figures 12 and 13 present the variation of directivity as a 
function of the direction angles for both frequencies in E and 
H plans, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It can be noted that the maximum directivities are located 
at 160° for 26 GHz and 180° for 27.6 GHz. The maximum 
directivity values at the previous angles are 12 dBi and 15.4 
dBi respectively.  
 
IV CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, a high directivity multi-beam antenna for 
Radio Frequency Energy harvesting in 5G network is 
presented. This antenna has a size of 65 x 55 mm² designed on 
Teflon glass substrate with a relative permittivity of 2.1 and a 
thickness of 0.67mm. The maximum directivity obtained is 
12.1 dBi for the 26 GHz frequency and 15.4 dBi for 27.5 GHz. 
The multibeam property makes this antenna capable of 
picking up waves at both frequencies (26 and 27.5) GHz in 
several directions with high directivity, which largely 
increases the received power.
