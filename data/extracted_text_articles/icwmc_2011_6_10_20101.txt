Abstract— It is particularly important to determine which 
propagation model is the most suitable for designing mobile 
radio systems in container terminal environment. The selected 
propagation models have been investigated. Results of the 
models' usefulness verification in terms of signal loss 
determination in such environment have been analyzed and 
discussed. The applied research methodology has been 
described too. The analysis have proved mismatching of these 
models to experimental data.

 INTRODUCTION 
Container port area should be treated as a very difficult 
radio waves propagation environment, because lots of 
containers made of steel are causing very strong multipath 
effect and there is time-varying container arrangement in 
stacks of different height. There are a number of propagation 
models, mainly for urban, suburban or rural environments 
[1, 2]. There is also propagation model destined for container 
port environment, but this model has been developed for 
designing only fixed radio links [3, 4]. Modeling of basic 
transmission loss in mobile radio links is more complicated, 
so it is particularly important to determine which propagation 
model is the most suitable for designing such links. This 
issue is very important and there is a lack of an analysis in 
this field. To solve this problem there is a need to verify 
existing models based on results of measuring research. Such 
tests have been carried out by authors in Deepwater 
Container Terminal Gdansk SA. Nearly 290 thousand data of 
propagation cases were collected according to normative 
requirements [5, 6], which have to be met during the 
research. The analysis contained in [7] has been taken into 
account too. 
At the outset of the paper (section II) the applied research 
methodology have been presented. This part describes both 
the measuring equipment and procedures. 
Next, in section III, the selected propagation models have 
been shortly characterized. These models are: ITU-R P.1411 
models for NLoS1 situations (in cases of propagation over 
roof-tops for urban and suburban areas), COST231 – 
Walfisch-Ikegami model and the above mentioned multi-
variant empirical model for designing fixed radio links in 
container terminal for LOS (line-of-sight) and NLOS (non-
line-of-sight) situations [3, 4].  
The main part of the paper (section IV) presents results 
of verification of the models' usefulness in terms of 
designing the mobile radio networks in container terminal 
environment. This verification is based on mean error and 
standard error of estimate, which are commonly being used 
to verify accuracy of the path loss models. 
At the end of the paper, in section V, the results have 
been summarized and discussed. Additionally, authors 
shortly present future research aimed at developing new 
propagation model for designing mobile radio links in 
container terminal environment.

APPLIED RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
The propagation research have been carried out in the 
years 2008-2009 in DCT Gdansk. The structure and power 
description of the measuring radio link have been presented 
in [8]. This link was built with fixed transmitting section, 
mobile receiving section and the propagation environment, 
which was the subject of research.  
As is known, basic transmission loss Lb of this 
environment may be expressed using following formula [8]:

calculated during calibration process of the receiving section.

equipment consisted of signal generator connected to 
transmitting antenna through the RF amplifier.

Figure 2.  The block diagram of the mobile receiving section 
The transmitting antenna was a monopole vertical 
antenna with electrical length of one-quarter of a 
wavelength. It has been developed and implemented in a 
manner, that allows to change its linear length, so it may be 
used to research on various frequencies. 
The mobile receiving section (Fig. 2) consisted of a 
spectrum analyzer (with built-in GPS receiver), an industrial 
computer, a rotary encoder with its controller and a test 
wheel, a LCD display, a safety lighting and a battery with a 
DC/AC converter. The receiving antenna was the same type 
as the transmitting antenna. Whole receiving section has 
been carried by test vehicle (hand-cart). 
The measurement results should include information 
about slow and fast changes of the power flux density of 
electromagnetic field (slow and fast fading, respectively) [7]. 
For obtaining 1 dB confidence interval around the real mean 
value, the test points have been chosen at each 0.8 λ 
(wavelength), over 40 λ averaging interval [6]. 
During the research in the DCT Gdansk nearly 290 
thousand data of propagation cases have been collected. 
These cases concern propagation routes with various lengths, 
various frequencies of test signal and various heights of 
transmitting antenna installation. 
III. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF SELECTED PROPAGATION 
MODELS 
The container terminal is a non-typical radio wave 
propagation environment. Due to its structure, consisting of 
containers' stacks placed on a flat surface and cut by a 
uniform grid of routes, it seems to be similar to urban areas 
[4]. However, fact that the containers are made of corrugated 
steel is the reason to suppose that the conditions of radio 
waves propagation in such environment might be quite 
different. It is also important that both the layout of 
containers' stacks, as well as their height are variable in time. 
After considering above mentioned issues, four well-known 
propagation models  have been selected, namely: 
• 
Walfisch-Ikegami for NLOS situations [1], 
• 
ITU-R P.1411 for NLoS1 situations (propagation 
over roof-tops for urban and suburban areas) [2], 
• 
empirical model for fixed radio links in container 
terminal (for LOS1 and NLOS1 situations) [3, 4]. 
These models are going to be evaluated in terms of their 
usefulness for designing of mobile radio links in container 
terminal environment. 
A. The COST231 Walfisch-Ikegami model 
The COST231 Walfisch-Ikegami model allows for good 
path loss estimation by consideration of a number of 
parameters to describe the character of the urban 
environment, namely: average height of buildings, widths of 
roads, building separation and road orientation with respect 
to the direct radio path. Obviously, the model also takes into 
account such parameters as propagation path length and 
signal frequency. The model distinguishes between LOS and 
NLOS situations. The second one was selected to be 
evaluated. In this case the basic transmission loss is 
composed of free space loss, multiple screen diffraction loss 
and roof-top-to-street diffraction and scatter loss. Formulas 
used to calculate basic transmission loss are explained in 
detail in [1]. 
B. The ITU-R P.1411 model 
Recommendation [2] includes propagation models 
destined for designing short-range outdoor radio systems for 
different types of environments. There have been selected 
two models for typical cases (NLoS1), where base station 
antenna is mounted above roof-top level.  
The first one is the model described in section 4.2.1 of 
Rec. [2]. This model should be used for estimating the basic 
transmission loss in a highly urbanized city centers, medium-
sized cities and suburban areas, where the roof-tops are all 
about the same height. It is a modified and extended version 
of the Walfisch Ikegami model. In addition, this model 
describes situations where the length of path covered by 
buildings is less than the so called "settled field distance". 
This situation hasn't been taken under consideration in 
Walfisch-Ikegami model. Mathematical formulas describing 
this model have been omitted due to their high complexity. 
The second model has been characterized in section 4.2.2 
of Rec. [2]. It may be used to calculate the basic transmission 
loss in suburban environment. Depending on the distance 
between base station and mobile station this model 
distinguishes three regions in terms of the dominant arrival 
waves at the mobile station, namely:  
• 
direct wave dominant region, when the distance 
between antennas of the wireless link is very short, 
• 
reflected wave dominant region, when the separation 
between base station and mobile station is relatively 
short, 
• 
diffracted wave dominant region, when antennas 
separation is long [2]. 
Mathematical formulas describing the basic transmission 
loss have been omitted because of their complexity.  
C. The model for fixed radio links in container terminal 
In context of this paper, particularly noteworthy is 
empirical model for designing fixed radio links in container 
terminal. It was developed upon the results of almost five 
119

thousand of propagation path measurements in real container 
terminal environment. This model makes the basic 
transmission loss dependent on the following parameters: 
frequency f, propagation path length d, path type 
qualification: line of sight or non-line of sight condition, 
difference between transmitter antenna height hT above 
terrain level and average height hav of container stack, but 
two possible cases are investigated separately: hT ≥ hav and 
hav > hT [3, 4]. 
From among four model variants, two describes the 
propagation situations that have occurred during the tests in 
the DCT Gdansk SA, namely: 
• 
LOS1, for hT ≥ hav:

This model is valid for frequency range from 500 MHz up to 
4 GHz. It should be highlighted that it is destined to estimate 
the basic transmission loss of fixed links.  
IV. 
STATISTICAL EVALUATION OF SELECTED MODEL 
Verification of selected models' usefulness in terms of 
designing the mobile radio networks in container terminal 
environment is based on two measures of matching 
experimental data to mathematical models, namely: mean 
error (ME) and standard error of estimate (SEE). These errors 
are commonly being used to verify accuracy of the path loss 
models and they are defined by following expressions [4]:

where Lm,i is the value of measured basic transmission loss in 
i-th position of receiver equipment (i=1,...,N), Lc,i means 
basic transmission loss value computed using propagation 
model for i-th position, and N is the sample size. Mean error 
value reflects the expected average difference between path 
loss values obtained using proposed model and real path loss 
measurement results, while standard error of estimate reflects 
dispersion of measured path loss values and describes how 
the propagation model matches to experimental data  [3]. 
Table 1 summarizes values of mean error and standard 
error of estimate for selected propagation models. It may be 
seen that the smallest error values have been obtained for the 
COST231 Walfisch-Ikegami model (for medium sized city 
and suburban areas and for data from the range of 
applicability) and for the model for fixed radio links in 
container terminal (for NLOS1 scenario). In the first case 
mean error reached -2.18 dB, which means that this model 
overestimates basic transmission loss in relation to real 
values. For the second model, obtained mean error is positive 
and equals 3 dB, which means underestimation of 
propagation loss. In both cases SEE exceeds the value of 
7 dB. Although the maximum acceptable standard deviation 
is 8 dB [9], it is expected that new propagation model for 
analyzed environment will allow to obtain much smaller 
error values. It also should be noted, that the  SEE  for 
Walfisch-Ikegami model, obtained for all data (from a range 
of 0.5÷4 GHz) is greater than acceptable value. 
On the other hand the least matched to experimental data 
is the ITU-R P.1411 model for NLoS1 scenario (§4.2.1), 
designed to calculate path loss in a highly urbanized city 
centers. Mean error with the value of -9.36 dB and the 
standard error of estimate at the level of 14.3 dB make this 
model unsuitable to calculate basic transmission loss for 
mobile links in the container terminal environment.

Figure 3.  Basic transmission loss calculated on the basis of COST231 Walfisch-Ikegami model and ITU-R P.1411 model 
In Fig. 3, the basic transmission loss graphs (including all 
propagation cases) for the Walfisch-Ikegami model and for 
the ITU R P.1411 model are presented. They have been 
drawn on the background of the measurement data for better 
illustration their matching to experimental data. The graph 
on the right is for the ITU-R model for NLoS1 scenario in 
metropolitan centers. This model is described in section 
4.2.1. of Rec. [2]. As is seen the calculated values don’t 
match well to experimental data. The graph on the left 
presents the results calculated on the basis of Walfisch-
Ikegami model for medium sized city and suburban areas. It 
is the best fitted model, assuming that the parameters are 
from the range of applicability. 
The results mentioned above allow to draw the 
conclusion that the propagation conditions occurring in the 
container terminal are different from the highly urbanized 
environments. They are more similar to suburban areas. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The analysis of the usefulness of selected propagation 
models to designing the mobile radio systems in the 
container terminal has been presented. This analysis has been 
done on the basis of the evaluation of selected propagation 
models in terms of their fit to data obtained during the tests. 
The research have been carried out in accordance with the 
recommendations [5, 6] and with taking into account the 
analysis contained in [7]. There are large differences in the 
results obtained for different propagation models. In addition 
the analysis have proved mismatching of these models to 
experimental data. Therefore, there is a need to increase 
accuracy of basic transmission loss estimation for mobile 
links in the container terminal environment. It may be done 
by modifying existing models or by developing new 
propagation 
model, 
taking 
into 
account 
additional 
independent variables, specific for the container terminal. 
Both methods are the goal of future research.
