Abstract—For 
signaling and controlling a centralized 
Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) with users operating in 
different sets of channels, a dedicated common control channel 
is not a useful approach. Different strategies have been studied 
for this CRN control, some of them using time division 
mechanisms. This is because employing a channel per each 
Cognitive Radio User (CRU) for simultaneously controlling 
them is not efficient. However, for signaling specific events to all 
CRUs in a CRN, the Central Cognitive Base Station (CCBS) 
needs to communicate to all the operating devices in the CRN 
domain. Reducing the number of broadcast signaling channels is 
then a need for good performance and energy efficiency of the 
CRN. In this paper, for the solution of this broadcasting 
signaling problem, each CRU is represented by an array 
considering its channel usability. Using this array, a static 
evaluation of the problem is initially performed. Then, the 
dynamic characteristics of CRNs are included to find an 
acceptable number of channels to communicate to every user in 
a specific CRN.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have been appointed as 
a solution to the apparent wireless spectrum scarcity problem 
[1-3]. This is because Cognitive Radio (CR) systems are able 
to detect free frequency spaces (bands) in the spectrum and to 
allocate communications in those spaces by using Dynamic 
Spectrum Access (DSA) mechanisms. CRN allow secondary 
users, i.e.  CRU with partial Access to use specific bands of 
the wireless spectrum, to use free frequency bands while the 
Primary Users (PU), i.e. licensed users of specific bands, are 
absent. 
In general, a CRN should be able to perform 4 tasks 
efficiently, spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum 
sharing, and spectrum mobility [2]. This means that have the 
ability of sensing, recognizing and adapting to specific 
characteristics of the environment. One of the CRNs most 
important characteristics is the ability for the Cognitive Radio 
Users (CRU) to dynamically access the spectrum. However, 
CRUs might be also capable of recognizing patterns of 
occupancy, to reduce the energy used for sensing, signaling 
and transmission. For this reason, Cognitive Radio 
technology has been also considered as an alternative to 
reduce energy consumption for wireless communications [4].  
 Several CR MAC protocols have been developed from 
Multi-channel MAC protocols. These MAC protocols can be 
categorized in dedicated control channel, split phase, 
common hopping, and default hopping [5]. Some specific CR 
MAC protocols use a dedicated common control channel [6, 
7]. However, heterogeneous CRU devices that do not share 
this control channel are not able to communicate in this CRN. 
Other than the aforementioned dedicated control channel 
approach, the other three approaches can be considered for 
efficient spectrum utilization because the CRN must operate 
in different frequency bands. On the other hand, these multi-
channel 
MAC 
protocols 
need 
some 
kind 
of 
user 
synchronization to determine the control channel beforehand. 
Furthermore, in multi-channel MAC protocols, all CRU must 
be able to use the same frequency channels, which is not 
always the case in heterogeneous systems. 
A cognitive pilot channel (CPC) is a solution proposed in 
the E2R project for enabling communication among 
heterogeneous wireless networks. The CPC consists on 
controlling frequency bands in a single or various “pilot” 
channels [8-11]. In [12], we have presented a basic model for 
a Centralized CRN that uses CPCs for signalization and 
control. The main idea was to introduce a control signal, 
basically periodical beacons, to announce channel availability 
and the necessity of leaving a frequency slot if that one was 
occupied. The basic model of the CRN provides signalling 
through CPCs distributed in every available channel or 
frequency slot. The control is performed by using frequency-
division and time-division multiplexing techniques. This 
control, as expected, permits the utilization of the CRN by 
heterogeneous CRU devices.  
In terms of energy, transmitting through every available 
channel would be inefficient. This is because the entire 
wireless spectrum channels would be occupied in a specific 
moment. Considering this problem, new alternatives should 
be explored to reduce the energy used for signaling CRUs 
channel availability. For reducing the energy, in [13], we 
used the characteristics of the time/frequency combined to 
approach for the CCBS to signal a new available channel only 
when a CRU that was not transmitting is requesting 
communication. We also considered the benefits of using a 
distributed control and a centralized database for reducing the 
amount of energy used to signal this availability in the CRN. 
The CCBS, however, still needs to broadcast signals to its 
users in some specific moments. Signals that must be 
broadcasted by the base station include periodical beacons, 
alarms, among others [14]. Several broadcasting problems 
such as the minimum broadcasting energy problem [15] and 
the allocation for broadcasting heterogeneous data in multiple 
channels [16-17], among others have been studied. To the

Control

best of the authors‟ knowledge, none of the broadcasting 
studies deal with the problem of broadcasting availability 
through a minimum number communication channels, in 
general; not for CRNs, in particular. The channel 
allocation/frequency assignment problem, however, has been 
studied in static and dynamic environments. We refer to [18] 
and [19] for an overview of models and solutions of the 
frequency assignment problem in those environments, 
respectively. One of the main considerations for studies in 
frequency assignment problems is that a channel can generate 
interference in adjacent channels. In our scenario, since the 
broadcast signaling is transmitted the same for each channel 
and only in a couple of a large number of sub-channels [12-
13], we can assume that using adequate modulation/coding 
schemes, interference among adjacent channels is non-
existent [19].  
The problem of obtaining the minimum number of 
channels for a base station, e.g. the CCBS, to transmit to all 
the users in its network is an optimization problem. For 
solving this problem, the dynamic characteristics of the CRN 
that include not only the entrance and departure of CRUs, but 
also external factors, the presence of PUs must be considered. 
However, several approaches that use algorithms to solve 
general optimization and broadcasting problems such as 
reduce the Greedy Algorithm, Satisfiabilty (SAT) theory [20], 
among others, might be adapted to solve this problem. In this 
paper, an adaptation of the greedy algorithm is proposed to 
solve the minimum number of channels problem, when this 
number of channels is low. 
The rest of this paper is divided as follows: In Section II, 
the model of the CRN and the description of the solution are 
depicted. In Section III, basic considerations for the algorithm 
are shown. In Section IV, early results of the minimum 
channel algorithm obtained by using the strategies are 
presented. In Section V, the results and future work are 
discussed.  
II. MODEL 
The basic model of the CRN used in this work is shown in 
Fig. 1. A Central Cognitive Base Station (CCBS) controls 
CRU communication so that these CRU do not interfere each 
other or a Primary User (PU). For modeling the CCBS, in this 
paper, we consider that the spectrum is continuously and 
perfectly sensed. We also consider that for each frequency 
band, a threshold is decided to determine if a user is already 
using that channel. A logical “1” is then assigned if a 
communication exists in a frequency slot; otherwise, a logical 
“0” is assigned. This information is stored as a vector in a 
database, which also stores information from the channel 
control and data communications. 
 
In Fig. 1, CRU1 is communicating with its corresponding 
CCBS (CCBS1), while PU1 is communicating with PU2. PU1 
transmission is within the range of the CCBS1 and CRU1. 
This means that the communication between CRU1 and 
CCBS1 must be performed in a different frequency slot than 
the one used for PU1-PU2 communication. A frequency/time 
representation of the corresponding scenario is also shown. In 
the proposed architecture, we assume that the management of 
the network is performed in the CCBS, which permits to 
reduce the amount of processes from the CRUs‟ terminals and 
therefore, keeping those terminals simple while using today‟s 
available technologies. We also assume that the CCBS 
decides which channel to assign for each CRU, according to 
the available channels and characteristics of the CRU. 
The basic model of the CRN provides signaling through 
cognitive pilot channels (CPCs) distributed in every available 
channel or frequency slot. The control is performed by using 
frequency-division 
and 
time-division 
multiplexing 
techniques. This control, as expected, permits the utilization 
of the CRN by heterogeneous cognitive radio user (CRU) 
devices. Frequency sub-slots are used by the CCBSs and 
CRUs to exchange both control and data information. The 
CCBS is responsible of controlling which CRUs are 
communicating and the frequency slots used, by assigning 
CRUs free frequency slots to communicate. This information 
is sent in a vector to the CRUs, while kept in the CCBS 
database. Fig. 2 shows the division in frequency and sub-
frequency slots.

The basic algorithm for each frequency slot was defined by 
Fig. 3. The database was mainly used for keeping into 
memory the location of CRUs and PUs in the frequency 
bands. The main energy reduction is accomplished by 
reducing signalization transmissions.  
 
When a CRU data communication is already established, 
and since PU communication can enter at any moment, a 
time-based approach is implemented in order to discover PU 
presence. This frequency and time system allows the 
elimination of a dedicated control channel for spectrum 
sharing. Using the slotted predefinition, if a transmission is 
received in a moment no transmission should be performed, 
we assume that a PU is communicating and, then, the channel 
is evacuated and the process of assigning a channel restarts, 
keeping into memory the last information that was going to 
be transmitted. The time slot division used for the CRN MAC 
presented in [12], as shown in Fig. 4, will be also used to 
reduce the signalization. 
 
In Fig, 4, an example of the CRU admission in the CRN is 
shown. 
CRU 
3, 
which 
has 
three 
channels 
for 
communications, “senses” its environment. Channel 1 is 
being used by a PU, so this channel is unavailable to CRU 
transmission. Channel 2 is occupied by CRU1. This makes 
the channel unavailable for CRU 3 use, but CRU 3 can detect 
the time slot position using CRU 1 transmission. Using that 
information, CRU 3 can access Channel 3 in time t2. 
In [13], two additional characteristics are added to the 
CRN model of [12] to reduce broadcast transmissions. The 
first one is that CRU synchronization will be performed as 
follows: Since CRUs know the duration of the time slot, the 
CRU will search during a time slot in its channels for 
continuous transmission. If a CRU finds a PU-free channel, 
the device will send a signal for announcing that this CRU 
wants to access the network. A channel occupied by a CRU 
will be identified because of the time slots used for control, so 
this scheme will not introduce collisions among CRUs. The 
second reduction consists on using the ability the CCBS has 
to identify the channels every CRU in the network is able to 
use. In this manner, the CCBS will only send a new broadcast 
transmission for each channel petition. This means that now, 
the entire wireless frequency spectrum considered for the 
CRN domain will not be used at several moments, and the 
number of periodical broadcast beacon transmission will be 
also reduced. 
In [13], we also showed that eliminating CCBS 
broadcasting transmission channels means a reduction in 
terms of energy per unit of time of approximately (number of 
available channels) x (broadcasting transmission time) x 
(power used for beacon transmission). Results indicated that a 
reduction in energy transmission due to signalization can be 
achieved by using the basic CRU sensing properties. Since the 
CRU can only detect values above a specific threshold for a 
determined period of time, the CRU might detect PU 
transmission due to its continuity, and CRU transmission due 
to its periodicity. Using that property, broadcasting 
transmissions, which contribute to energy waste, are reduced. 
Another advantage of using this property is that the CCBS is 
already aware of the available channels of each CRU. This is 
because in the admission process, each CRU has already 
indicated its characteristics. Considering that the CCBS has 
this knowledge, direct channel assignation can be performed, 
so broadcast transmission is also reduced. Then, the idea is to 
find the minimum number of broadcasting channels for the 
CCBS needed broadcasting transmission. 
Considering again that the CCBS has knowledge of the 
channels each of the CRUs is able to use, for finding this 
minimum number of the broadcast transmission channels 
needed in a specific moment, a matrix called availability 
matrix is included. The relation among the frequency slots 
(channels) and CRUs in a specific time is shown in Fig. 5.

In Fig. 5, the availability matrix per CRU (A) in a specific 
time is presented. A channel is unavailable to a CRU due to 
two reasons: a PU is using an available channel for the CRU 
or the CRU cannot communicate through that channel. Using 
this information, each CRU is represented by a row and each 
channel, by a column. Each element represents then the 
availability of a channel to a CRU in a specific moment. A 
logical „1‟ is assigned in this case if the channel is available 
to the user and a „0‟ if the channel is unavailable. 
In the availability matrix represented in Fig. 5, the eighth 
column, corresponding to f7, is a unitary column. This means 
that using that channel (f7), the CCBS can broadcast 
communication to all the users in its CRN during that period 
of time. In Fig. 6, a case where more than one channel is 
needed for the CCBS to broadcast is shown. 
 
In the case presented in Fig. 6, the availability matrix 
shows that at least the CCBS needs two channels to 
communicate with all the CRUs in the network. The matrix 
composed with all the vectors that use the minimum channels 
for the CCBS to communicate is represented as Minimum 
Solutions. In general, the problem of finding this minimum 
solution vectors is the same as finding the vectors with the 
least numbers of „1‟s such that the intersection of them with 
each of the row vectors that compose the availability matrix is 
not empty.

several of the n channels that a CRN presents, c1, c2, …, cn, 
the idea is to find an array in which a base station CCBS is 
able to transmit to each user (ui) utilizing the minimum 
number of channels.  
The matrix that relates channel usability for each CRU is 
represented as Umxn. Each row vector defined by U(i, :) is 
always different than 0, taking into account that each CRU 
must have at least one channel to communicate. So, not 
considering primary occupation, the problem can be defined 
as finding a vector v1xn such that

is true, which is the definition of the n-satisfiability 
problem. This vector is defined in general for this paper as 
the vector of minimum solutions. 
In the case when PUs are not considered, let‟s assume that 
for an array consisting on m users and n channels, the 
minimum number k of broadcasting channels for the array 
has been found. As shown in Fig. 4, CRUs enter and leave the 
CRN dynamically. This means that the algorithm for finding 
the minimum solutions vectors must consider the dynamics of 
the network. For reducing the complexity of the algorithm, 
the property that this CRN has that only a new CRU can 
enter/leave at a specific time is used. If a new CRU enters the 
network, the minimum number of channels needed to 
broadcast signals to each of the CRU devices is at most k+1, 
and at least k. Similarly, if a CRU leaves the CRN, the 
minimum number for the broadcast signalling channels is at 
least k-1, and at most k. 
However, as shown in Fig. 4, a channel is inoperative when 
used by a PU. The presence of PUs can be described by using 
the mask vector p containing the PU occupancy stored in the 
CCBS database. Considering that U(i,:) is the usability vector 
for CRU i, the vector A(i,:) = U(i,:)*p represents the 
availability vector for transmitting broadcast signals by the 
CCBS. When primary occupation is considered, in some 
specific moments a CRU i defined by A(i,:) might be 
unavailable for communication.

IV. CASE STUDY 
In this section, early results obtained when using low 
numbers of channels and CRUs in the network are presented. 
The number of channels was defined to be low in order to 
compare the results of the algorithm for obtaining the 
minimum number of channels to communicate with all the 
CRUs with the real minimum number. 
For the first simulation, the number of channels n was 
defined as 8. The number of CRUs, m, was also defined as 8, 
due to the fact that the maximum number of users that can 
communicate in a specific moment is the number of channels 
available in the network. The number of time slots, t, is 
defined to be 10. CRU and PU presence in the CRN are 
defined as random, with probabilities 0.2 and 0.5, 
respectively. In Table I, the channel usability of all the 
possible CRUs in the CRN is shown.

As shown in Table I, the minimum number of channels 
needed to transmit to all CRUs in the network is 2, using f1 
and f5, f4, f7, f3 and f5. 
An advantage of the broadcasting solution is that the base 
station, e.g. the CCBS, in theory is able to communicate with 
as many CRUs in the CRN as desired. This means that even 
idle CRUs can receive information from the CCBS. As a 
proof, we simulate this situation by doubling the number of 
CRUs. Results are shown in Table II.

Notice that the number of minimum channels for 
communicating with all CRUs is similar. In this case, this 
number is four, two more than in the previous situation. 
Besides, this is because CRU 10 and CRU 16 only have f8 and 
f3, respectively as their usable channels. A possible minimum 
solutions vector is then v = [1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1]. The similarity 
on the number is because the CRUs, while heterogeneous in 
frequency, are defined with similar characteristics. 
The algorithm considered for solving the minimum number 
of channels is an adaptation of the Greedy Algorithm. The 
basic idea is that the channel that might be used the most by 
the CRUs is the first to be considered as a possible solution to 
communicate to all the CRUs. The next channel to be 
considered as a solution to the problem is the second that 
might be used the most by the CRUs. The vector is 
constructed by defining as „1‟ all these channels until all the 
possible channels are considered. An obvious improvement 
for this algorithm is to discard the CRUs that are covered 
with the channel in the previous step, and repeat the process 
until every CRU is able to receive communication from the 
CCBS. For reducing the calculations for the following time 
slots, the property that the difference between the minimum 
numbers of channels needed for broadcasting in consecutive 
time slots is at most one. Considering the patterns of entrance 
and departure of the CRUs, shown in Table III, the numbers 
of channels, defined by mod(v), needed to broadcast to all 
active CRUs are presented in Table IV.

As expected, CRUs might not receive information from the 
CCBS because the channels are occupied by the PUs. This 
can be seen when t = t6. CRU1 and CRU3 are in the CRN but 
the CCBS cannot transmit information to any of them 
because their available channels are already in use by PUs. 
Another situation that might arise because of PUs‟ presence is 
the necessity for the CCBS to transmit through more channels 
to reach the same CRUs.  
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
The transmission of broadcasting signals is a necessity in a 
centralized network. In this manner, the base station can 
reach all its users, in this case CCBS and CRUs, respectively. 
This is in order for the CCBS to announce alarms, 
availability, among others. When broadcasting availability as 
a periodical beacon to heterogeneous frequency systems, 
reducing the number of broadcasting channels is a need for 
energy reasons.  
The sole idea of analyzing a simple network for finding a 
vector composed of the minimum number of channels a 
cognitive radio base station needs to broadcast signals to all 
its users is a NP-complete problem as shown in section III. 
Different solutions might be found using diverse techniques. 
For easing the algorithm, characteristics of the proposed CRN 
model are used. 
When considering primary occupation, some of those 
characteristics are not useful. This is the reason why a greedy 
approach was considered at first. The fact that both the 
number of CRUs and channels were considered to be low 
helped making the decision of choosing the greedy approach, 
which is known to be useful in those cases. 
For future works, different techniques such as tree-based 
and genetic approaches, as well as satisfiability techniques 
will be considered, when expanding the number of channels 
and users. For deciding which technique to base the new 
minimum solution algorithm, three characteristics will be 
evaluated: complexity of the algorithm, time of execution and 
closeness to the optimal solution. In the energy reduction 
part, more strategies to reduce energy transmission, such as 
database 
use 
for 
PUs 
and 
low-energy 
transmission 
mechanisms, will be explored.
