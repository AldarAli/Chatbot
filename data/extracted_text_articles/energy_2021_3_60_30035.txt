Abstract—Energy demand for development is increasing 
worldwide, while fossil energy resources are gradually 
becoming exhausted, and their use has many negative 
environmental 
impacts. 
The 
exploitation 
of 
potential 
renewable sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels is one of 
the key strategies for national development. Vietnam has a 
coastline of more than 3000 km, and has a marine area of more 
than 1 million km2, with many locations having average wind 
speeds exceeding 6m/s. The Vietnamese Government’s 
National Power Development Plan for the period from 2011 to 
2020 with the outlook to 2030 provides for an increase in 
installed wind power capacity to around 1 GW by 2020 and to 
6.2 GW by 2030. However, insufficient human resources 
trained in the field of wind power and high investment costs 
for equipment imported from abroad are among the biggest 
barriers to wind power development in Vietnam. This paper 
will discuss the potential and challenges of near and offshore 
wind energy in Vietnam.  
Keywords-Nearshore and offshore wind energy; wind power;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Vietnam has a coastline of more than 3,000 km and a 
marine area of more than 1 million km2. The population of 
Vietnam has increased significantly over the past decades, 
and now stands at over 96.5 million people [1]. In 2019, 
Vietnam’s economy continued to show fundamental strength 
and resilience, supported by robust domestic demand and 
export-oriented 
manufacturing. 
Real 
Gross 
Domestic 
Product (GDP) grew by an estimated 7 percent in 2019, 
similar to 2018, one of the fastest growth rates in the region 
[2]. Rapid urbanization has also occurred from 2005 in the 
country [3]. Population growth coupled with increased 
demand for goods and services, rapid urbanization, and 
rapidly growing economic activities in the industrial and 
service sectors are putting pressure on energy sources in 
Vietnam. According to [2], electricity consumption in 
Vietnam has tripled over the past decade. Vietnam's power 
demand is forecasted to increase 8.7%/year on average in the 
National Power Development Plan (Revised PDP VII), 
which has replaced the PDP VII in the period of 2016 - 2030. 
In the coming years, the socio-economic development in 
Vietnam would require a substantial amount of energy. The 
projection of future energy demand in Vietnam by [4] is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1. Projection of energy demand in Vietnam [4] 
 
Because of increasing reliance on fossil fuels, the power 
sector itself accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country’s 
greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Vietnam has a young and fast-
growing economy and has put effort into tackling climate 
change issues at both a national and international level [5]. 
The Government is promoting the development and use of 
renewable energy sources, especially wind power, in its 
strategy to increase domestic energy supply and reduce 
dependence on fossil fuels. This will contribute to ensuring 
energy security, climate change mitigation, environmental 
protection and sustainable socio-economic development. 
Furthermore, an adequate and reliable energy supply is a 
necessary 
prerequisite 
for 
sustaining 
the 
economic 
development of the country. Despite the advantage of 
geographic location and governmental policies in promoting 
the development of near and offshore wind power, wind 
power has a long way to go to achieve its potential in 
Vietnam. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In 
Section II, I discuss the potential and challenges of near and 
offshore wind energy in Vietnam, and offer some 
conclusions in Section III. 
II. 
POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES OF NEAR AND 
OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY 
A. Opportunities and potential 
Vietnam has an advantage of geological location for 
wind power development. It has a coastline of more than

3,000 km and a marine area of more than 1 million km2 [1]. 
The country’s sea region has a huge potential for wind 
energy resources in offshore waters of up to 30m in depth 
(with an area of 111,000 km2), and in water  of between 30m 
and 60m in depth (142,000 km2 in area), which have a 
potential capacity of producing 64,000 GW and 106,000 
GW, respectively. One of results reported in [6] shows that 
the installed capacity potential is up to 38 GW in only the 
waters around each Phu Quy or Bach Long Vi island. The 
coastal area of Binh Thuan - Ca Mau provinces is the most 
promising region with a potential wind-powered generating 
capacity of almost 1000 W/m2 [7]. It was also said that this 
area has 6 locations with the highest wind speeds (average 
wind speed of 10 m/s), each with a potential of 1,000 MW 
and has the advantage of not taking up land, which is a main 
concern in Vietnam [8]. It is considered one of the regions 
with high potential globally. Wind farms have been deployed 
in this region with a total capacity of 1 GW and are expected 
to be 9 GW in 2030 [7]. In addition, other researchers [9] 
used a numerical Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) 
model for studying offshore wind power potential along the 
southern coast of Vietnam and concluded that the southern 
coastal area of Vietnam is characterized by strong seasonal 
and spatial variability in both wind speed and direction. The 
authors of [9] also indicated that the offshore areas of Ninh 
Thuan and Binh Thuan provinces are likely to have the 
largest wind power potential, though still with strong 
seasonal variation. A recent study [6] reported that wind 
within 0–185 km from shore throughout Vietnam has the 
technical potential to generate at least 500 - 600 GW. A wind 
mapping for Vietnam in 2019 was published by [10]. The 
technical potential for offshore wind in Vietnam is shown in 
Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2: Technical potential for offshore wind in Vietnam [10] 
 
Recognizing this potential, the Government of Vietnam 
has also issued decisions and policies to promote 
development 
in 
this 
field, 
including 
Decision 
1208/2011/QĐ-TTg issued by the Prime Minister on July 21, 
2011 approving the National Electricity Development Plan 
(PDP VII) for the period 2011-2020 with consideration to 
2030. In this Decision, the installed wind power capacity 
needs to increase to around 1 GW by 2020 and to 6.2 GW by 
2030 [11]. After the Decision singed in 2011, Decision 
No.2068/QĐ-TTg was issued by the Prime Minister on 
November 25, 2015 approving the Renewable Energy 
Development Strategy (REDS) to diversify the energy 
supply of Vietnam to the year of 2030, with a vision for 2050 
[12]. The REDS emphasizes that the output of electricity 
produced from wind power will increase from about 180 
million kWh in 2015 to about 2.5 billion kWh by 2020; 
about 16 billion kWh in 2030 and about 53 billion kWh in 
2050. It would raise the proportion of total electricity 
production from wind power from the current negligible 
level to about 1.0% by year 2020, about 2.7% in 2030 and 
about 5.0% in 2050. This decision is one of strategies to 
encourage investment and development of wind power in 
Vietnam. An example for this is that Vietnam is among 
leading countries in developing offshore wind power in Asia: 
China (2.4 GW), Vietnam (0.2 GW), Japan (0.04 GW), 
South Korea (0.04 GW) and Taiwan (0.008 GW) [13]. In 
addition,  because of Vietnam's wind potential and electricity 
demand, the Prime Minister issued Decision 39/2018/QĐ-
TTg on September 10, 2018 to create a preferential FIT 
(Feed-in-Tariff) 
price 
mechanism 
to 
encourage 
the 
development of energy types. Currently, the purchase price 
for onshore wind power according to this Decision is 1,927 
VND per kWh, equivalent to 8.5 cent per kWh (excluding 
VAT), while offshore is 2,223 VND per kWh, equivalent to 
9.8 cent per kWh (not including VAT) with projects 
operating before November 1, 2021 [14]. This Decision has 
created a new momentum for the wind power market in 
Vietnam and attracted a series of wind power development 
projects. As reported by [15], until March 2020, Vietnam 
had 78 wind power projects with a total capacity of about 
4.8GW, which were added to the planning; 11 projects (with 
total capacity of 377MW) have been operating and 
generating electricity; 31 projects (total capacity of 1.62GW) 
have signed power purchase agreements and are expected to 
be put into operation in 2020-2021. In addition, a further 250 
projects with a total capacity of about 45GW have been 
requested as part of the electricity development plan for 
Vietnam. 
B. Difficulties and challenges  
There are many difficulties and challenges for near and 
offshore wind power development. First, lack of human 
resources trained in the field of wind power is one of the 
biggest 
difficulties 
and 
challenges 
in 
wind 
power 
development. On one hand, Vietnam has a wind power 
project that has been in operation for nearly a decade, and it 
also has projects that cooperate with international 
organizations 
in 
assessing 
wind 
power 
potential. 
Consequently, human resources in Vietnam have had the 
opportunity to access wind energy technology since then 
(from the wind measurement campaign, detailed design, etc), 
and currently many wind power projects have been in 
65

operation and are under construction. Nevertheless, Vietnam 
still lacks contractors with experience in installing, repairing 
and maintaining equipment. Several short-term training 
courses providing basic knowledge of wind turbine 
technology and key steps involved in developing wind power 
projects in Vietnam have been organized mainly at Hanoi 
University of Science and Technology and Ho Chi Minh 
City University of Science and Technology. However, there 
are no specialized majors in the field of renewable energy in 
general, or wind power in particular, at universities and 
colleges in Vietnam. Lecturers in this field are lacking and 
curricula are also limited, creating a shortage of human 
resources for wind power technology. In addition, shortages 
of skilled human resources for  implementing complete wind 
power projects including, for example, carrying out 
assessments of wind resources, preparing investment reports, 
etc., basic technical and maintenance services, operation and 
management after installation of wind turbines, are also 
barriers for development of wind energy in Vietnam [4]. 
Training 
and 
raising 
professional 
qualifications 
for 
managers, technicians, and skilled workers for wind energy 
projects should be a priority. An initial step might be to 
encourage 
the 
establishment 
of 
specialized 
energy 
associations and organizations such as, for example, the 
Vietnam Wind Power Association and the Renewable 
Energy Organization, with the participation of experts from 
prestigious foreign organizations, universities, and research 
institutes. This mix of expertise could provide advice to the 
Government and further promote the development of the 
wind power industry in Vietnam. Second, high investment 
costs for wind power projects are also among the biggest 
barriers to wind power development in Vietnam. A 
successful wind power project often requires a sizable 
investment in infrastructure and current costs are about 2,500 
USD/kW on average, which is equivalent to more than 50 
million VND/kW. An example for this is that the Bac Lieu 
wind power project has had a total investment of about 5,300 
billion VND for a total capacity of about 99.2 MW, 
implemented by Cong Ly Construction - Trade & Tourism 
Co., Ltd from 2010 to present. This project is supported by 
an USA bank through a loan guaranteed from the 
Vietnamese Government. Another difficulty is that wind 
power technologies are imported from abroad. Wind turbines 
and other related equipments used for most wind energy 
projects in Vietnam must be imported from countries such as 
the USA, Germany, Denmark and so on. In Vietnam, we 
mainly construct the foundation base and the parts connected 
to the turbine such as culverts, electrical systems, etc. 
Therefore, wind power projects depend almost entirely on 
foreign technology. The Vietnamese government should 
provide investors with a good opportunity to manufacture 
wind power equipment so that they can set up factories in 
Vietnam, or assemble them in Vietnam. This could be done 
through incentives such as a reduction in tax on assembly of 
wind power equipment in Vietnam. This would reduce 
dependence on foreign technology and help reduce the cost 
of purchasing equipment for wind power generation. Other 
difficulties and challenges include slow land clearance and a 
long distance to connect to the power grid [16]. There are 
also other challenges to wind power development. 
Environmental problems related to wind power plants such 
as noise from the turbine blades affecting the daily activities 
and behavior of animals such as birds, etc. have also been 
reported [17][18]. Another potential issue is how to dispose 
of outworn parts of wind turbines safely and without causing 
environmental 
pollution. 
Apart 
from 
environmental 
problems, the connection of wind power plants to any 
electrical system has impacts on the electricity quality such 
as variations in voltage, overload in the network, flickers, 
harmonics, voltage dips, etc. [19]. So, they are also 
challenges to wind power development in Vietnam in the 
future. In addition, Vietnam is a developing country and its 
laws and policies for renewable energy are not stable. This 
could discourage private and public investment in wind-
powered energy projects. For example, [20] reported that 
from 2007 to 2017, the many Decisions and Circulars for 
wind energy development promulgated by the Government 
have hindered the development of wind power projects in 
Vietnam. More recently, the Decision 39/2018/QĐ-TTg 
issued on September 10, 2018, as mentioned above, creates a 
preferential FIT pricing mechanism to encourage wind 
power development as well as attract more investors, but it 
also creates difficulties for investors with wind power 
projects operating after November 1, 2021. According to the 
proposal of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam 
[15] to the Prime Minister, the wind power purchase and sale 
price for the projects in operation from November 2021 to 
December 2022 will be 7.02 cents per kWh for onshore wind 
power and 8.42 cents per kWh for offshore or nearshore 
wind power. For projects operating in 2023, the prices are 
6.81 and 8.21 cents per kWh, respectively. At present, the 
impact of the COVID-19 virus is affecting the turbine supply 
progress, prolonging construction and installation time and 
slowing down the progress of wind power projects. The 
production and supply of key equipment, components and 
accessories of wind power projects are also in shortage and 
stagnation. The interruptions of the import and export of 
goods, immigration of technical workers and foreign experts, 
etc have had negative impacts on enterprises. Investors will 
face financial difficulties and many influences from Covid-
19 if wind power prices fall. They will also encounter the 
early stage market and the risks of Government’s wind 
power planning adjustment. These could significantly reduce 
new wind power installations in 2023 and next years. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
The potential for wind power in Vietnam is huge, but it is 
a relatively new field. Although the Government has issued a 
range of policies and strategies to develop this energy source, 
there are still many barriers to the development of this field 
such as, for example, insufficient human resources, 
dependence on overseas technology, high investment capital, 
etc. Developing training programs in this field in universities 
and research institutes is necessary. Turbines and other 
related equipment (electrical engine, tower, etc) typically 
account for a large portion of the total cost of wind power 
projects (farms). Assembling or manufacturing partly or fully 
the equipment at domestic factories will help reduce

dependence on foreign technology and will reduce costs. 
Moreover, to implement a successful wind power project, it 
is necessary to have timely financial support from reputable 
domestic or international credit institutions and the 
Government.
