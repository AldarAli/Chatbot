Abstract—This paper proposes and evaluates a new clustering 
algorithm:  Weighted Election Probabilities Clustering Scheme 
(WEPCS) for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks 
(HWSNs). WEPCS is an improvement of the Energy Efficient 
Heterogeneous Clustered (EEHC) protocol. The modification 
proposed allows the election of Cluster Heads (CHs) using 
different weighted probabilities. The WEPCS algorithm aims 
mainly to improve network stability period and the network 
throughput. An Experimental evaluation is presented and the 
results show that the WEPCS achieves longer life time and 
more throughput than the existing clustering protocols in 
heterogeneous environments.

INTRODUCTION  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are an example of 
the paradigm shift-taking place in wireless network 
architectures. 
Recent 
advances 
in 
computing 
and 
communication have caused a significant shift in sensor 
network research.  
WSN is composed of a Base Station (BS) and a number 
of wireless Sensor Nodes (SNs). These SNs are 
characterized as low-cost and low-power entities and are 
capable of communication at very short distances, also,  
they perform limited computation. All SNs, communicate 
wirelessly, and form a sensor field [1,2]. Typically, BS 
serves as an access point for the user, or as a gateway to 
another network. 
The main task of the SN is to sense and collect data from 
a certain region, process it, and transmit it to the BS, where 
further processing on the collected data can be performed. 
So, WSN can be used in a wide variety of civilian and 
military applications, e.g., environmental monitoring, 
battlefield surveillance, industry process control, and health.  
Depending on the application of WSNs, certain routing 
protocols 
are 
required 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
the 
communication among SNs and the BS [3]. WSNs consume 
their limited energy while collecting data, performing 
calculations, and routing the received data. Nevertheless, in 
most applications, each SN is expected to last for a long 
time. For these reasons, both efficient routing schemes and 
efficient use of energy are highly important in WSNs. 
Different techniques have already been proposed to 
improve energy consumption rate and network's lifetime, 
such as: clustering and data aggregation. 
Clustering is a key technique used to extend the lifetime 
of WSN by organizing SNs into clusters. Each cluster has a 
leader called Cluster Head (CH). Each SN transmits its data 
to the closest CH to minimize energy consumption. Then 
the CH manages communication within a cluster, and 
forwards collected data from its Cluster Members (CMs) to 
the BS. 
In clustered WSNs, CH has a higher burden than its 
CMs The CH drains its energy much more quickly than the 
CMs. Rotating the CH’s role distributes this higher burden 
among SNs, thereby preventing CH from dying prematurely 
[4,5]. Hence, an important design issue in WSNs is to lessen 
the energy consumption in WSN for sake of the network 
lifetime. 
One of the ways for saving energy is to insert a 
percentage of SNs equipped with additional energy 
resources in the sensing field, i.e., making WSN 
heterogeneous in terms of energy. 
Many existing schemes for Heterogeneous Wireless 
Sensor Networks (HWSNs), such as SEP [6], DEEC [7], 
and EEHC [8], demonstrate that HWSNs are supposed to 
survive for a longer time compared to homogeneous WSNs. 
This paper proposes and evaluates a new clustering 
algorithm:  Weighted Election Probabilities Clustering 
Scheme (WEPCS) for HWSNs. It takes advantages from 
previous developed algorithms and studies the impact of 
heterogeneity of SNs on the network performance, based on 
their energy levels. The main issue of our interest is to 
maximize the lifetime of  HWSN and throughput. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
discusses the related work. Section III presents the proposed 
algorithm. Section IV provides the experimental results. 
Section V concludes the paper and discusses the future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Most of the clustering algorithms, e.g., LEACH [9], 
assume WSNs are homogeneous, where all SNs have the 
same initial energy. These algorithms perform poorly in 
heterogeneous environments, where all SNs of WSN are 
equipped with different amounts of energy. HWSNs are 
very much useful in real deployments because they are more 
close to real life situations; so the work presented in this 
paper emphasizes upon HWSNs where two or more types of 
SNs are considered  [10,11,12,13].  
Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) 
[9] is one of the most simple and effective widely deployed 
clustering solutions for WSN. In LEACH, each SN is given 
equal chance to be a CH. The clusters are re-established and 
new CHs are elected in each “round”, so that the load is 
distributed and balanced among SNs of the network.  
Distributed Energy-Efficient Clustering (DEEC) [7] is a 
cluster-based scheme for two level and multilevel

energy HWSNs. DEEC is based on LEACH. In this scheme, 
CHs are selected using the probability based on the ratio 
between the residual energy of each SN and the average 
energy of the network. Thus, DEEC can prolong the 
stability period. SNs with high initial and residual energy 
will have more chances to be CHs than low energy SNs. 
However, this choice penalizes always advanced SNs, 
because these SNs will be continuously CHs. In this 
situation, the advanced SNs die quickly than the others.  
Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Clustered (EEHC) [8] is 
developed for the 3-level heterogeneous networks, which 
include three types of nodes according to the initial energy, 
i.e., the super nodes, the advance nodes and the normal 
nodes. The rotating epoch and election probability is 
directly correlated with only the initial energy of nodes. 
EEHC performs poorly when heterogeneity is a result of 
operation of the sensor network. 
III. 
THE WEIGHTED ELECTION PROBABILITIES 
CLUSTERING SCHEME (WEPCS) 
After studying the operation of LEACH [9], DEEC [7], 
and EEHC [8], the following facts were noticed: 
First, SN nearer to BS than to any CH may send its data 
to far CH, as shown in Fig. 1. As a result, it will lose more 
energy compared to the case of sending its data directly to 
BS, as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
 
Figure 1.  The Network Model for the General Clustering Algorithms. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  The Network Model for the WEPCS Algorithm. 
Second, when no SN elects itself as CH, and at the same 
time there are some SNs still alive and has enough energy to 
send data to BS, then SNs usually will turn off to sleep 
mode. In turn, the packets of these live SNs will not be sent 
to BS. This great disadvantage influences the transmission 
reliability in the networks, especially for some important 
real-time tasks, e.g., fires and volcanoes.  
Third, in EEHC, the “CH weighted election probability” 
equation does not consider the residual energy of the SNs, 
the residual energy of the network, and the number of live 
SNs, i.e., EEHC depends only on the initial parameters of 
the network. In addition, EEHC considers three types of 
SNs only (normal, advanced, and super) instead of Multi-
Level type that can be encountered in HWSN after a 
significant amount of time of operation.  
Thus, in this paper, we will consider the previous notes 
in the proposed algorithm. 
 
 
 Improving network stability period in terms of the 
Death of First SN (FND), by increasing the time until 
a SN breaks down 
 Increasing HWSN lifetime in terms of the Death of 
Half SNs (HND), by increasing the half-life period of 
the network 
 Increasing total throughput, by increasing the total 
number of packets that sent to BS. 
 To achieve these goals, WEPCS includes the following  
modifications: 
BS will act as if it is one of CHs thus, 
 Non CH (NCH) is allowed to send its packets 
directly to BS when it has no CH, i.e., when no SN 
elects itself as CH and there are some SNs still 
alive. Hence, in WEPCS, loss of data due to 
inability to reach BS is avoided. This enhances 
WSN efficiency. 
 NCH is allowed to choose its nearest leader (CH or 
BS), i.e., if any NCH is nearer to BS than any CHs, 
it will contact directly to BS. Moreover, 
accordingly, the power dissipation due to the 
distance 
will 
be 
decreased, 
and 
more 
communication energy will be saved.  
CH selection will depend on three basics: 
 The weighted election probability equation, which 
is used in threshold and epoch calculations, is 
based on the residual energy of SNs, the actual 
residual energy of the network, and the number of 
alive SNs. 
 The scheme of WEPCS is implemented along three 
scenarios for sending the remaining energy 
information of SN to BS along three different rates: 
none in implementation-a (Impl-a), every round in 
implementation-b (Impl-b), and every epoch in 
implementation-c (Impl-c).  
We consider different models of HWSN, which are Two 
Level, Three-Level, and Multi-Level in terms of the SN 
initial energy. 
 
 
The operation of each round of WEPCS is divided into 
three phases,  as shown in Fig.3. 
Set-Up Phase: SNs will organize themselves into local 
clusters, with one SN acts as CH. SNs elect themselves as 
CHs with respect to their energy levels, autonomously. Then, 
BS selects CHs based on suggestions of requesting SNs to 
be CHs, i.e., the proposed algorithm is a combination 
between distributed and centralized clustering algorithms. 
Fig. 4 gives an overview of the formal description of the 
Set-Up phase. 
Steady-State Phase: The sensed data packet will be 
collected from all CMs by its leader (CHs or BS). CHs

perform processing functions on the received data (e.g., data 
aggregation and compression). Then CHs send the 
compressed data to BS. 
BS has two types of data: one from CHs, and another 
from SNs that sent directly to BS. BS performs another data 
aggregation function, which aggregates both types of data. 
Maintenance phase: The “network status” information, 
which contains the real number of live SNs and the total 
remaining energy of the network, will be updated for all 
SNs.  
CMs send their “remaining energy” information to their 
leaders (CH or BS). The leaders aggregate remaining 
energies and calculate the real number of live SNs in their 
clusters, and then CHs send this “energy level” information 
to BS.  
After that, BS aggregates the real number of live SNs 
and the total remaining energy of the network. Then, BS 
broadcasts “network status” to all SNs in the network. 
Finally, SNs receive this information, and update their 
stored “network status”.  
This “network status” will be used in three different 
ways, according to the implementation scenarios of  
WEPCS:  Impl-a,  Impl-b, or Impl-c. 
After this phase, the next round begins, and the 
algorithm reforms the CH selection process. 
 
Figure 3. Phases of the  Proposed Algorithm 
 
 
      When a new round begins, each SN decides whether to 
become CH or not. This decision is made by SN choosing a 
random number between 0 and 1.  
SN becomes a CH for the current round, if the number is 
less than the following threshold [8]:

where  Pୱ౟ is the weighted election probabilities of SN in the 
current round  r,  and  G  is the set of SNs that are eligible to 
be CHs at round  r. 
 
Figure 4. Formal Description of the Set-Up phase 
After SN works as CH in current round, it will not 
belong to the set G, i.e., it will be prevented from being 
elected again during next rounds until it passes its individual 
rotating epoch (mSi= 1/ Pୱ౟). After a new epoch starts, SN 
will belong again to the set  G. 
Weighted Election Probabilities: WEPCS makes more 
control on the threshold. This control is achieved based on 
the weighted election probability,  ۾ܛܑ.  According to the 
implementation scenarios of WEPCS, ۾ܛܑ is computed as 
follows:  
a)  Implementation-a  of  WEPCS (Impl-a)  
The weighted probability for Impl-a scenario is: 
 
 
Pୱ౟ =
n୧୬୧୲୧ୟ୪ × P୭୮୲ × Eୱ౟(r)
E୲୭୲ୟ୪ି୧୬୧୲୧ୟ୪
 
(2)  
 
where P୭୮୲ is optimal percentage of SNs to become 
CHs, Eୱ౟(r) is current energy of SN per round, 
 n୧୬୧୲୧ୟ୪  is the total number of SNs at the start of 
the network operation, and E୲୭୲ୟ୪ି୧୬୧୲୧ୟ୪is the total 
initial energy of HWSN. 
b) Implementation-b of  WEPCS  (Impl-b)  
The weighted probability for Impl-b scenario is: 
 
 
Pୱ౟ =
n(r) × P୭୮୲ × Eୱ౟(r)

where  n(r) is total number of SNs in the network 
at the start of each round and  Etotal(r) is total 
energy of HWSN at the  start of each round. These 
two values are updated every round by using 
network status information. 
c) Implementation-c of  WEPCS (Impl-c)  
The weighted probability for Impl-c scenario is: 
 
 
Pୱ౟ =
n(m) × P୭୮୲ × Eୱ౟(r)
E୲୭୲ୟ୪(m)
 
(4) 
 
where  n(m) is total number of SNs at start of each 
optimal epoch and  Etotal(m) is total energy of 
HWSN at the start of each optimal epoch. These 
two values are updated every optimal epoch 
(mopt=1/Popt). 
 
 
We have considered the following assumptions: 
 All SNs are randomly distributed in a (M * M) square 
sensing field. 
 All SNs and BS are stationary, after deployment.  
 All SNs have unique IDs and they are location-
unaware. 
 BS is located at the center of the square field. 
 BS location is known by each SN in the network.   
 Type of communication is single hop. 
 Communication is symmetric and SN can compute the 
approximate distance based on the received signal 
strength.  
 The communication environment is contention and 
error free. Hence, SNs do not have to retransmit any 
data. 
In the work presented in this paper, WEPCS is applied on 
several types of HWSN, including Two-Level, Three-Level, 
and Multi-Level in terms of the SN initial energy. Next, the 
total initial energy of each network level is calculated. This 
total energy is used in computing  Pୱ౟ in Eq. (2), (3) and (4) 
to elect CH at the start of WEPCS within the three scenarios 
of implementation. 
Two-Level  HWSN 
There are two types of SNs :  advanced and normal SNs. 
Let’s assume that E0  is the initial energy of normal SNs,  
and m is the fraction of advanced SNs, which own α times 
more energy than the normal ones. 
Thus there are n*m advanced SNs equipped with initial 
energy of (1+α)*E0, and  n*(1-m)  normal SNs equipped 
with initial energy of  E0. The total initial energy of the 
Two-Level HWSN [6,7,12] is: 
Etotal = n*(1-m)*E0+n* m*(1+ α) *E0= n* E0*(1+ α m) (5)  
Three-Level Network 
There are three types of SNs:  super, advanced, and 
normal SNs. Assuming  that E0  is the initial energy of 
normal SNs,  m  is the fraction of advanced SNs, which own  
α  times more energy than the normal ones, and m0 is the 
fraction of super SNs, which own β  times more energy than 
the normal ones.  
Thus there are  n*m*m0  super SNs equipped with initial 
energy of (1 + β)*E0,  n*m*(1–m0)  advanced SNs equipped 
with initial energy of  (1 + α)*E0 , and n*(1 – m) normal 
SNs equipped with initial energy of  E0. The total initial 
energy of the Three-Level HWSNs [8,10,11] is : 
Etotal = n *m*m0*(1+ β) E0 + n*m*(1–m0)*(1+ α) E0 +n*(1–m)*E0 
Etotal  = n*E0*(1+ m*(α –a*m0+m0* β)) 
(6) 
Multi-Level Network 
There are many different types of SNs. Let assume the 
initial energy E0 is randomly distributed over the close set 
[E0 , E0*(1 + αmax)], where E0 is the lower bound and αmax 
determines the value of the maximal energy. Initially, the 
node si is equipped with initial energy of E0*(1 + αi), which 
is αi times more energy than the lower bound E0. The total 
initial energy of Multi-Level HWSNs [7] is: 
Etotal = E0 (1+ α1) + E0 (1+ α2) + .........+ E0 (1+ αn)

The work presented in this paper adopts the same energy 
model proposed in [9,14]. The free space energy model used 
because SNs are randomly distributed over the sensing field 
and BS is at the center, as a result, the distance from any SN 
to the BS or its CH is small.  Table 1 describes the energy 
dissipation in CHs during each phase and Table 2 describes 
the energy dissipation in NCHs (CMs) during each phase.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  AND ANALYSIS 
 
 
The simulation has been done using MATLAB. The 
parameters used in our simulation are shown in Table 3.  
The SN is considered dead when it has energy less than the 
energy needed for transmitting L1-bit packets to its leader. 
In addition, the optimal percentage of  SNs that will be CHs 
Popt is equal to 5% of the total number of SNs in the network 
as in [9, 14]. 
B. Simulation Metrics

HWSN is defined by three metrics [15]:

 Last Node Died (LND), which indicates an

number of alive SNs per round and the total number of 
dead SNs per round. 
 Throughput: This metric reflects the total number of data

 Improvements along the metrics: The improvement of 
FND, HND, and Throughput  will be calculated by:

This section provides a limited set of results, obtained 
using simulation. The simulation results compare the 
performance of WEPCS to the three previously developed 
algorithms: 
LEACH 
(Homogeneous 
LEACH, 
and 
heterogeneous LEACH), DEEC, and EEHC. Homogeneous 
LEACH schemes are obtained assuming that the SNs of 
WSN are equipped with the same amount of energy. Also, 
heterogeneous LEACH schemes are considered assuming 
that a percentage of the SNs’ population is equipped with 
more energy than the rest of SNs in the same network. We 
extended LEACH, DEEC, and EEHC to be tested under 
Two-level, Three-level, and Multi-level HWSNs. 
1) Results Under Two-Level  HWSN 
For two-level heterogeneous networks, Fig. 5 and Table 
4  show the results of the case with  m=0.3, and a=1.5. This 
mean that the total number of normal SNs (Nn) is equal to 
70, initial energy of normal SNs (Ein) is equal to 0.5 J, total 
number of advanced SNs (Na) is equal to 30, initial energy 
of advanced SNs (Eia) is equal to 1.25 J, and total initial 
energy of network (Etotal) is equal to 72.5 J.

equipped with 200% more energy than normal SNs, and 10% 
of SNs are super which are equipped with 100% more 
energy than normal SNs. 
3) Results Under Multi-Level  HWSN 
In this case, we consider that the initial energies of  SNs are 
randomly distributed in [E0,=0.5 2E0=1]. The results are  in 
Fig. 7 and Table 6. In addition, Figs. 8, 9, and 10 show the 
effect of changing initial energy of SN, packet size of SN, 
and number of SNs. 
From our simulations, we observed the followings: 
1. The stability period of WEPCS is prolonged compared 
to 
that 
of 
LEACH, 
DEEC, 
and 
EEHC 
in 
heterogeneous settings. 
2. The instability period was shortened for WEPCS 
compared to that of LEACH, DEEC, and EEHC. 
3. The number of packets received by BS (Throughput) 
during the lifetime of the network are more than that 
of LEACH, DEEC, and EEHC. This is because 
WEPCS has more number of alive SNs as shown in 
Figs. 5(b), 6(b), 7(b).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, we proposed and evaluate WEPCS; a new 
clustering scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor 
networks. WEPCS is an extension of the EEHC. In WEPCS, 
the election of cluster-heads is based on different weighted 
probabilities. The epochs of being cluster-heads for nodes 
are different according to their initial and residual energy. 
Finally, the simulation results show that WEPCS achieves 
longer lifetime and more throughput  than current important 
clustering protocols in two-level, three-level, and multi-
level heterogeneous environments.  
The work done in this paper is based on the assumption 
that the communication environment is contention and error 
free.  
A future extension of the work may consider the effect of 
the underlying medium access protocol. Also, the work can 
be extended by applying the algorithm to multi-hop HWSN.
