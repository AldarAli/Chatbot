Abstract - Air quality is one of the most critical issues that 
humankind is facing today. There are diverse types of indices 
measuring  air pollution, which are mostly based on aggregation 
functions. This paper proposes a model aimed at forecasting 
aggregated air pollution indices, which enables modelling data 
uncertainties. The proposed original model consists essentially 
of two sub models. The first one models Air Quality Index 
(AQI), while the second one models concentrations of pollutants. 
Multi-contaminant air quality index is modelled as an 
aggregation of the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) obtained via 
fuzzy linear transformation defined by fuzzy breakpoints. We 
model concentrations of pollutants by regression (XGBoost, 
Deep Neural Network, ADA Boost, and Histogram Gradient 
Boosting Regressor) using fuzzy time series of two groups of 
data 
(pollutants’ 
concentrations 
and 
meteorological 
parameters). In doing so, the target variable was modeled in two 
ways. The first model is a set of independent classes defined by 
proper fuzzy membership functions, while the second one is a 
set of classes connected by an ordering relation. Simulation 
results are presented showing the model performance for each 
of the target variable models in terms of prediction mean 
absolute errors. The main result of the paper is a unified model  
of air quality assessment relying upon a consistent mathematical 
theory called Linear fuzzy space.     
Keywords - Linear fuzzy space; AQI index; aggregation 
operator; connected classes. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version of our conference paper 
"Linear Fuzzy Space Based Framework for Air Quality 
Assessment" [1] presented at the INTELLI 2022 Conference 
held in Venice in May 2022.  
In relation to the initial work, this work introduces an 
improvement related to modeling the target variable. While in 
the original paper the target variable was modeled by 
independent classes described by appropriate membership 
functions, in this paper the target variable is modeled as a set 
of classes with an ordering relation. 
The research presented in both the original and extended 
papers is motivated by the fact that in the last decade, 
humankind has been facing air pollution as one of the most 
important issues with adverse effects on human health, but 
also on the economy of societies. According to WHO's annual 
World Health Statistics report from 2016, outdoor air 
pollution causes approximately 4.2 million deaths per year [2]. 
As reported by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) in 
2018, the number of deaths in Europe related to concentrations 
of the particles PM2.5 was about 379,000 [3]. Therefore, there 
is a great need for air pollution forecasting models that will 
express the air pollution as a simple value that is 
understandable for a wide audience.  
Air pollution is an extremely complex spatio-temporally 
determined dynamic system distinctly characterized by the 
presence of imprecision and uncertainty. Therefore, it is not 
easy to give a precise air pollution forecast, which would be 
of great importance for public health. 
To cope with uncertainty and imprecision, we use a fuzzy 
approach. More precisely, the one based on our previous 
results presented in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8], where we introduced 
mathematical models for basic concepts: fuzzy point, fuzzy 
spatial relation, fuzzy ordering, fuzzy distance, fuzzy 
measurement and simple geometrical fuzzy objects (line, 
triangle, circle). For modelling the temporal dimension of air 
pollution, we use a combination of time series models with 
techniques supporting the manipulation of imprecise and 
uncertain data, known under the umbrella term Fuzzy Time 
Series (FTS). This model enables a more adequate air 
pollution forecast.  
Multi-contaminant Air Quality Index/Common Air 
Quality Index (AQI/CAQI) manages multiple effects due to 
the exposure to more pollutants, gives more complete 
information on the possible impacts of air pollutants and a 
direction for a more accurate, consistent, and comparable

AQI/CAQI system. Hence, we opt for multi-contaminant 
AQIs/CAQIs as a model of air pollution estimate.  
 
For that purpose, the ordering relations  ≤𝑅𝐹  and  ≤𝐿𝐹 
were introduced and it was proved that they agree with the 
definition of the fuzzy ordering with respect to the 𝑡-norm 𝑇 
and the equivalence 𝐸 (𝑇 − 𝐸 ordering) from the Linear fuzzy 
space. 
Simulations were performed for the two proposed target 
variable models on the same data set using the same regression 
models (XGBoost, Deep Neural Network, ADA Boost, and 
Histogram Gradient Boosting Regressor). 
The obtained results showed the superiority of the model 
of connected classes over the model of independent classes in 
terms of mean square error. 
The rest of the paper is organized into five sections. 
Section 2 presents related work, Section 3 brings theoretical 
foundations, while Section 4 presents the model of the 
proposed framework. Section 5 shows model application and 
simulation results for the real data set (82457 samples/16 
variables/24h measurements). Finally, Section 6 summarizes 
the research results, identifies deficiencies, and outlines future 
research. 
II. RELATED WORK  
This section brings analysis of related work and basic 
underlaying preliminaries of our research. 
As already said, air pollution is a complex spatio-
temporally determined dynamic system characterized by the 
presence of imprecision and uncertainty, which makes air 
pollution modelling and prediction a challenging task. The 
research field itself is vivid, yearly generating hundreds of 
publications, which deal with the modelling task. There are 
also several recent papers that provide more-less inclusive 
overview of the field like [9] with specific objectives (a) to 
address current developments that push the boundaries of air 
quality research forward, (b) to highlight the emerging 
prominent gaps of knowledge in air quality research, and (c) 
to make recommendations to guide the direction for future 
research within the wider community. This research identifies 
Earth system modelling as offering considerable potential by 
providing a consistent framework for treating scales and 
processes.  
One important issue of air quality modelling is the quality 
indicator, which is called Air Quality Index (AQI) in the USA 
and Common Air Quality Index (CAQI) in Europe. These two 
terms share the same semantics so we shall use them 
interchangeably through the rest of this text.  
As shown in [10], a multi-contaminant model of AQI in 
which aggregation functions (aggregation operators) are 
applied to combine several numerical values into a single 
representative is predominant by far.  
The simplest 𝐴𝑄𝐼 model calculates a sub-index (𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖) for 
each pollutant 𝑖 by the following linear interpolation formula: 
𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖 = 𝐼ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝐼𝑙𝑜𝑤
𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤
(𝐶 − 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤) + 𝐼𝑙𝑜𝑤 . 
Here, 𝐶 is the monitored ambient average concentration of 
pollutant 𝑖; 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤 is the breakpoint lower than or equal to 𝐶; 
𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ is the breakpoint higher than or equal to 𝐶; and 𝐼𝑙𝑜𝑤 
and 𝐼ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ are the sub-index values corresponding to 𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑤 
and 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ, respectively. The overall 𝐴𝑄𝐼 is then calculated 
as a simple max aggregation: 
𝐴𝑄𝐼 = max𝑖=1
𝑚 (𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖). 
There is ongoing research for new aggregation functions, 
which involve the influence of multiple pollutants [11] [12] 
[13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]. Among these 𝐴𝑄𝐼s, arithmetic 
pollutant aggregation integrates pollutants in a linear or 
nonlinear way, and weighted pollutant aggregation further 
assigns varied weights from different approaches. The 
General Air Quality Health Index (𝐺𝐴𝑄𝐻𝐼) is proposed as a 
pollutant-aggregated, local health-based 𝐴𝑄𝐼  paradigm 
suitable for representing a complex multi-contaminant 
situation:  
𝐼𝑠 = (∑(𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖)𝛼
𝑛
𝑖=1
)
1
𝛼
, 
where 𝛼 ∈ [1, ∞]. 
An interesting modification of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 𝐴𝑄𝐼 is proposed in  
[11], giving a new index 𝑅𝐴𝑄𝐼, which is the product of three 
terms: 
𝑅𝐴𝑄𝐼 = 𝐹1 ∗ 𝐹2 ∗ 𝐹3 
were 
𝐹1 = max(𝐼𝑖),
𝑖 = 1,5 
𝐹2 =
∑
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦
5
𝑖=1
(𝐼𝑖)
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∙ (∑
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦
5
𝑖=1
(𝐼𝑖))
 
and the Shannon entropy function is introduced in the third 
term: 
𝐹3 =
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 ∙ 𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 (max𝑖=1
5
(𝐼𝑖))
𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 (max𝑖=1
5
(𝐼𝑖))
 
This model strives to avoid ambiguity (indicating a less 
polluted air as highly polluted) and ellipticity (indicating 
highly polluted air as less polluted) by introducing entropy. 
In addition, there are interesting approaches like in  [12] 
that model the air pollution index via a mixture of distributions 
based on its structure and descriptive status as well as research 
doing with development of aggregate air quality index for a 
specific agglomeration [13] and tools used to inform the 
public about the status of the ambient air quality  [14] in which 
different AQIs are analyzed to contribute to the sharing of air 
quality management practices and information to raise public 
awareness and to help policymakers to act accordingly.  
There are also results that utilize fuzzy logic for modelling 
air quality indices, like those presented in  [15] [16] [17] [18].

In the paper [15], Atacak and coauthors present the model 
in which the input variables are air pollutant criteria (PM10, 
SO2, CO, NO2, O3), and the output variable is fuzzy AQI. 
The fuzzification process is defined via the boundary values 
of the universal sets and the corresponding fuzzy sets 
(trapezoidal for input, and triangular for output variables). The 
rule base representing the relationship between input variables 
and output variables has 243 rules. The max-min inference 
strategy and centroid method are chosen for the inference and 
defuzzification process. The paper [16] proposed an index 
that, in addition to criteria air pollutants (CO, SO2, PM10, O3, 
NO2), includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and 
1,3-butadiene due to their considerable health effects. 
Different weighting factors were then assigned to each 
pollutant according to its priority. Trapezoidal membership 
functions were employed for classifications and the final 
index consisted of 72 inference rules.  
Time series is a model that is extensively used in air 
quality modelling. In [17], the authors present a comparative 
study of the results obtained from several models for air 
pollution index forecast, which shows that the fuzzy time 
series models outperformed the other models in terms of 
forecasting accuracy and computation time. Finally, [18] 
utilizes a fuzzy time series-Markov chain model for predicting 
the daily air pollution index.  
Current air quality research relies heavily on machine 
learning. Another characteristic that could be attributed to 
them is the still partial observation of the phenomenon, with 
rare attempts at comprehensive modeling of this extremely 
complex system. With the pretension to show only a rough 
picture of the area and to connect it with the earlier claim, we 
have presented here a few characteristic papers. The first 
criterion for the selection of the presented papers was that they 
deal with air quality research, the second criterion was that 
they applied artificial intelligence techniques for research and, 
finally, the third criterion was that they were published in the 
course of 2022. An exception to the last criterion is the paper 
[19] from 2019, which we presented because it provides an 
overview of neural network models applied in the field, with 
the focus on the most frequently studied pollutants (PM10, 
PM2.5, nitrogen oxides, ozone). In this source, most of the 
work is devoted to the long-term forecasting of outdoor 
PM10, PM2.5, oxides of nitrogen, and ozone. Most of the 
identified works used meteorological and source emissions 
predictors 
almost 
exclusively. 
Furthermore, 
ad-hoc 
approaches are found to be predominantly used for deciding 
optimal model predictors, proper data subsets with the optimal 
model structure. Multilayer perceptron and ensemble-type 
models are predominantly implemented. The paper [20] is a 
review paper that is based on 128 articles published from 2000 
to 2022. The review reveals that input uncertainty was 
predominantly addressed while less focus was given to 
structure, parameter, and output uncertainties. Ensemble 
approaches are used mostly, followed by neuro-fuzzy 
networks. The use of bootstrapping, Bayesian, and Monte 
Carlo simulation techniques, which can quantify uncertainty, 
was also found to be limited. Authors recommend the 
development and application of approaches that can both 
handle and quantify uncertainty surrounding the development 
of ANN models. The source [21] is also a review paper 
showing recent attempts to use deep learning techniques in air 
quality forecasts. There are presented deep networks, e.g., 
convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, 
long short-term memory neural networks, and spatiotemporal 
deep networks, and their connection to the nonlinear 
spatiotemporal features across multiple scales of air pollution. 
The source presents deep learning techniques for air quality 
forecasts in diverse aspects, e.g., data gap filling, prediction 
algorithms, estimations with satellite data, and source 
estimations for atmospheric dispersion forecasts. The paper   
[22] is a focused one. This paper develops a hybrid modeling 
framework that combines the elastic net and multivariate 
relevance vector machine for interval-valued PM2.5 time 
series forecasting. Instead of directly modelling linear and 
nonlinear patterns of time series, there is introduced the multi-
factor interval division approach and bivariate empirical mode 
decomposition algorithm into linear and nonlinear pattern 
modeling, respectively. The last source presented here [23] 
developed the LIFE Index-Air tool, where the air pollutant 
concentrations are predicted by Artificial Neural Networks 
trained using a set of air quality modeling simulations. 
Authors argued that the results show that this approach based 
on ANN, calibrated using a limited number of air quality 
modeling system simulations, can reproduce the concentration 
values competently. 
Previous analysis of air quality research shows that 
research in the field of air quality modeling and prediction is 
active and diverse, with research that deals with inaccuracies 
and uncertainties in the data applying a fuzzy approach being 
very common. A significant lack of current research, in the 
opinion of the authors of this paper, is a consistent theoretical 
basis for modeling air quality as a temporally and spatially 
determined system with inaccuracies and uncertainties in the 
data (including spatial and temporal data). 
 Our work represents an investigation of the possibility to 
use the theory of Linear fuzzy space, which we are 
developing, as a theoretical basis for modeling air quality as a 
time-space system with inaccuracies and uncertainties in the 
data. In addition to theoretical results used in this paper, the 
theory of Linear fuzzy space includes models of imprecise 2D 
geometric objects (line, triangle, circle), models of imprecise 
spatial 
operations 
(spatial 
measurements, 
spatial 
transformations, spatial relations), and initial results proving 
the theory extensibility to a fuzzy finite automata model. In 
this way, a consistent framework is obtained that applies to 
modeling and simulation of air quality systems, including 
urban pollution where the space geometry plays an important 
role. 
III. PRELIMINARIES  
The theoretical foundations of our model are based on 
Linear fuzzy space theory, multi-contaminant fuzzy AQIs, 
fuzzy time series, and Machine Learning (ML)-based 
classification.

This section presents in brief basic underlaying 
preliminaries of our research, Linear fuzzy space, fuzzy 
aggregation operators and fuzzy time series. 
A. 
Linear fuzzy space 
In this subsection, we present the fundamental concepts of 
the Linear fuzzy space theory: fuzzy point, linear fuzzy space, 
fuzzy space ordering, fuzzy linear combination, and fuzzy 
space metrics, as defined in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. 
Definition 1 Fuzzy point 𝑃 ∈ 𝑅2, denoted by 𝑃̃ is defined by 
its membership function 𝜇𝑃̃ ∈ ℱ2, where the set ℱ2 contains 
all membership functions 𝑢: 𝑅2 → [0,1]  satisfying the 
following conditions:  
i) 
(∀𝑢 ∈ ℱ2)(∃1𝑃 ∈ 𝑅2) 𝑢(𝑃) = 1,    
ii) (∀𝑋1, 𝑋2 ∈ 𝑅2)(𝜆 ∈ [0,1]) 𝑢(𝜆𝑋1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑋2) ≥
𝑚𝑖𝑛( 𝑢(𝑋1), 𝑢(𝑋2)), 
iii) function 𝑢 is upper semi-continuous, 
iv) [𝑢]𝛼 = {𝑋|𝑋 ∈ 𝑅2, 𝑢(𝑋) ≥ 𝛼}  𝛼 -cut of function 𝑢  is 
convex. 
Here, a point from 𝑅2  with a membership function 
𝜇𝑃̃(𝑃) = 1, is denoted by 𝑃 (𝑃 is the core of the fuzzy point  
𝑃̃ ), the membership function of point  𝑃̃ is denoted by   𝜇𝑃̃, 
while  [𝑃]𝛼 stands for the  𝛼-cut (a set from 𝑅2) of the fuzzy 
point.  
Figure 1 shows geometrical illustration of a fuzzy point 
membership function 𝜇(𝑋) and its 𝛼-cut. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Geometrical illustration of a) a fuzzy point membership 
function and b) its 𝛼-cuts 
Definition 2 𝑅2 Linear fuzzy space is the set ℋ2 ⊂ ℱ2 of 
all functions, which, in addition to the properties given in 
Definition 1, are: 
i) 
Symmetric with respect to the core 𝑆 ∈ 𝑅2  
(𝜇(𝑆) = 1), 𝜇(𝑉) = 𝜇(𝑀) ∧  𝜇(𝑀) ≠ 0 ⇒  
𝑑(𝑆, 𝑉) = 𝑑(𝑆, 𝑀) 
  where 𝑑(𝑆, 𝑀) is the distance in 𝑅2. 
ii) Inverse-linearly decreasing regarding points’ distance 
from the core, i.e.: 
If 𝑟 ≠ 0:   𝜇𝑆̃(𝑉) = max (0, 1 −
𝑑(𝑆,𝑉)
|𝑟𝑆| ), 
If 𝑟 = 0:   𝜇𝑆̃(𝑉) = {    1      𝑖𝑓   𝑆 = 𝑉 
    0       𝑖𝑓   𝑆 ≠ 𝑉 , 
where  𝑑(𝑆, 𝑉) is the distance between point 𝑉 and   
the core 𝑆 (𝑉, 𝑆 ∈ 𝑅2) and  𝑟 ∈ 𝑅 is a constant.  
The elements of that space are represented as ordered pairs  
𝑆̃ = (𝑆, 𝑟𝑆) where 𝑆 ∈ 𝑅2 is the core of  𝑆̃, and  𝑟𝑆 ∈ 𝑅 is the 
distance from the core for which the function value becomes 
0.  
Definition 3. A 𝑡-norm is a function 𝑇: [0, 1] × [0, 1] →
 [0, 1] that satisfies the following properties: 
i) 
Commutativity: 𝑇(𝑎, 𝑏) =  𝑇(𝑏, 𝑎) 
ii) Monotonicity: 𝑇(𝑎, 𝑏) ≤  𝑇(𝑐, 𝑑) if 𝑎 ≤  𝑐 and 𝑏 ≤  𝑑 
iii) Associativity: 𝑇(𝑎, 𝑇(𝑏, 𝑐)) =  𝑇(𝑇(𝑎, 𝑏), 𝑐) 
iv) The number 1 acts as identity element: 𝑇(𝑎, 1) =  𝑎 
Definition 4. Let 𝑋 be a nonempty set and function  𝑇 be 
a 𝑡 -norm. Fuzzy relation 𝐸: 𝑋 × 𝑋 → [0,1]  is called fuzzy 
equivalence relation (𝑇-equivalence) with respect to 𝑡-norm  
𝑇 if the following axioms for 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 ∈ 𝑋 hold: 
i) 
Reflexivity   
𝐸(𝑥, 𝑥) = 1 
ii) Symmetry    
𝐸(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝐸(𝑦, 𝑥) 
iii) T-Transitivity 
𝑇(𝐸(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝐸(𝑦, 𝑧)) ≤ 𝐸(𝑥, 𝑧) 
Definition 5. Let 𝐸: 𝑋 × 𝑋 → [0,1] be a 𝑇-equivalence. 
Fuzzy relation 𝐿: 𝑋 × 𝑋 → [0,1] is called fuzzy ordering with 
respect to norm  𝑇 and equivalence 𝐸 (𝑇 − 𝐸 ordering) if for 
any  𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 ∈ 𝑋 the following hold: 
i) 
E- Reflexivity 
  𝐸(𝑥, 𝑦) ≤ 𝐿(𝑥, 𝑦) 
ii) T-E Anti-symmetry      𝑇(𝐿(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝐿(𝑦, 𝑥)) ≤ 𝐸(𝑥, 𝑦) 
iii) 𝑇- Transitivity 
  𝑇(𝐿(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝐿(𝑦, 𝑧)) ≤ 𝐿(𝑥, 𝑧) 
Definition 6 Let ℋ2  be a linear fuzzy space. Then, a 
function 
𝑓: ℋ2 × ℋ2 × [0,1] → ℋ2
 called 
a 
linear 
combination of the fuzzy points 𝐴̃, 𝐵̃  ∈ ℋ2 is given by: 
𝑓(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃, 𝑢) = 𝐴̃ + 𝑢 ∙ (𝐵̃ − 𝐴̃), 
where 𝑢 ∈ [0,1], the operator + is the sum of fuzzy points, 
and the operator ∙ is the scalar multiplication of the fuzzy 
point. 
Note: The thesis [4] defines operations sum of fuzzy points 
(+) and scalar multiplication of the fuzzy point (∙) and proves 
that an ordered quadruple (ℋ2, +,  𝑅2, ∙)   is a vector space. 
Figure 2 is a geometrical illustration of the linear 
combination of the fuzzy points 𝐴̃, 𝐵̃  ∈ ℋ2. 
Measurement in space, especially the distance between 
plane geometry objects, is defined as a generalization of the 
concept of physical distance.

points 𝐴̃, 𝐵̃  ∈ ℋ2 
 
Definition 7. Let ℋ2  be a linear fuzzy space and  
𝑑̃: ℋ2 × ℋ2 → ℋ+ 
, 
L,     R: [0,1] × [0,1] → [0,1]
 be 
symmetric, associative, and non-decreasing for both 
arguments, and L(0,0) = 0 , R(1,1) = 1 . The ordered 
quadruple (ℋ2, 𝑑̃, L, R) is called fuzzy metric space and the 
function 𝑑̃  is a fuzzy metric, if and only if the following 
conditions hold: 
i) 
𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃) = 0̃ ⇔ [𝑋̃]1 = [𝑌̃]1 
ii) 𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃) = 𝑑̃(𝑌̃, 𝑋̃),  ∀𝑋
̃ , 𝑌̃ ∈ ℋ2 
iii) ∀𝑋̃, 𝑌̃ ∈ ℋ2: 
if 𝑠 ≤ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑧) ∧  𝑡 ≤ 𝜆1(𝑧, 𝑦) ∧ 𝑠 + 𝑡 ≤ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑦) 
𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃)(𝑠 + 𝑡) ≥ L(𝑑(𝑥, 𝑧)(𝑠), 𝑑(𝑧, 𝑦)(𝑡))   
if 𝑠 ≥ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑧) ∧ 𝑡 ≥ 𝜆1(𝑧, 𝑦) ∧ 𝑠 + 𝑡 ≥ 𝜆1(𝑥, 𝑦) 
𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃)(𝑠 + 𝑡) ≤ R(𝑑(𝑥, 𝑧)(𝑠), 𝑑(𝑧, 𝑦)(𝑡))  
The 𝛼-cut of a fuzzy number 𝑑̃(𝑥, 𝑦) is given by 
 [𝑑̃(𝑋̃, 𝑌̃)]
𝛼 = [𝜆𝛼(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝜌𝛼(𝑥, 𝑦)] (𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝑅+, 0 < 𝛼 ≤ 1). 
The fuzzy zero, 0̃ is a non-negative fuzzy number with 
[0̃]1 = 0.  
B. 
Fuzzy aggregation operators 
An aggregation operator has natural properties such as 
monotonicity and boundary conditions. In practice, the data is 
usually normalized, so the definition of aggregation becomes: 
Definition 8. An aggregation function (operator) is a 
function 𝐴(𝑛): [0,1]𝑛 → [0,1]  that satisfies the following 
conditions: 
1. 
is nondecreasing (in each variable) 
2. 
𝐴(𝑛)(0, … ,0) = 0 and 𝐴(𝑛)(1, … ,1) = 1. 
Aggregation applies to various fields and takes diverse 
forms, from the simple to quite sophisticated and complex 
ones, modelling the interaction between criteria, which are 
managed by monotone set functions and corresponding 
integrals [24] [25] [26] [27]. In our research, a fuzzy 
aggregation operator is the basic instrument for multi-
contaminant AQI/CAQI modelling. 
C. 
Fuzzy time series 
Most of the real-world tasks that utilize time series rely on 
multivariate time series models [28] [29] [30] [31]. The 
common multivariate time series model is [28]: 
Let 𝑍𝑡 = [𝑍1,𝑡, 𝑍2,𝑡, … , 𝑍𝑚,𝑡]
′  be an 𝑚  -dimensional 
jointly stationary real-valued vector process such that 
𝐸(𝑍𝑖,𝑡) = 𝜇𝑖  is a constant for each 𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝑚  and the 
cross-covariances between 𝑍𝑖,𝑡 and 𝑍𝑗,𝑠 for all 𝑖 = 1,2, … , 𝑚 
and 𝑗 = 1,2, … , 𝑚 are functions only of the time difference 
(𝑠 − 𝑡). 
On the other hand, the original definition of the univariate 
first fuzzy time series model is [31]: 
Definition 9. Let 𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 = . . . ,0,1,2, . . . ) , a subset of 𝑅1 
be the universe of discourse on which fuzzy sets 𝑓𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖 =
1,2, . . . ) are defined and 𝐹(𝑡) is the collection of 𝑓𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖 =
1,2, . . . ) . Then, 𝐹(𝑡)  is called a fuzzy time series on 
𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 =. . . ,0,1,2, . . . ). 
Our time series model is a combination of the previous two 
where we apply the same common multivariate model, which 
is modified to support imprecise values. In our model, we 
simply replace a crisp point with a linear fuzzy space point 
[4]:  
Definition 10. Let 𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 = . . . , 0 ,1 , 2, … ), a subset of 
𝑅1 be the universe of discourse. Let ℋ𝑙 (𝑙 = 1,2) be a linear 
fuzzy space. Furthermore, let 𝑓𝑖(𝑡)(𝑖 = 1,2, … ) be fuzzy sets 
defined as points on a linear fuzzy space over the given 
universe of discourse, and 𝐹𝑗̃(𝑡)(𝑗 = 1,2, … 𝑚) be collections 
of these fuzzy points. Then, 𝐹𝑡̃ = [𝐹̃1,𝑡, 𝐹̃2,𝑡, … , 𝐹̃𝑚,𝑡]
′ is called 
a linear fuzzy space based fuzzy time series on  𝑌(𝑡)(𝑡 =
 . . . , 0, 1, 2, … ).  
This definition enables all features of linear fuzzy space to 
be used. For example, a process vector can be of a mixed type 
(some components can be crisp, some can be fuzzy) whilst 
spatial relations defined on the linear fuzzy space hold.  
IV. FUZZY MODEL OF AIR POLLUTION INDICES PREDICTION 
In this example, we show how the linear fuzzy space is 
used for time series-based forecasting. Fuzzy time series 
defined by the linear fuzzy space, as described in subsection 
C of Section III, are used to model air quality forecast.  
A. 
Data model 
The data model used in this paper consists of temporal 
georeferenced samples. Each sample is a time series covering 
the earlier 24h in 1h sample rate (total 385 real values). Each 
time series corresponds to one variable. Variables are divided 
into two groups: six common air pollutants known as “criteria 
air pollutants” [32], and ten meteorological parameters, the 
Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) [33] shown in

Linear Fuzzy Space-based air pollution index 
Since air pollutants are measured in different physical 
units and scales, the first step is to transform them into a 
common domain (0-500). This transformation is usually 
defined by breakpoint tables and the resulting values are 
called Pollutant Standard Index (PSI). Instead of using 
discrete functions, we propose a fuzzy linear transformation 
defined by fuzzy breakpoints (Figure 3).  
 
 
Figure 3.  Fuzzy linear transformation for Ground-level Ozone (O3) 
A fuzzy linear transformation is defined by an ordered list 
of 2D Fuzzy points 𝑃̃ = (𝑋̃, 𝑌̃) . Each 2D fuzzy point consists 
of two components 𝑋̃ = (𝑋, 𝑟𝑥) and 𝑌̃ = (𝑌, 𝑟𝑌), which are 
1D fuzzy points. 
Then, Fuzzy PSI (FPSI) is defined as: 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖
̃ = 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝
̃ (𝐶, [𝑃0̃ , … 𝑃𝑛̃ ]) = ( 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖, 𝑟𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼) , 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖 = 𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤
𝑋ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤
(𝐶 − 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤) + 𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤 
𝑟𝑃𝑆𝐼 = 𝑟𝑌ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑟𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤
𝑟𝑋ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑟𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤
(𝐶 − 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑤) + 𝑟𝑌𝑙𝑜𝑤 
where 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑝
̃
 is a fuzzy linear transformation from 
concertation fuzzy space into index fuzzy space. Fuzzy points 
𝑃ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ
̃  and 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑤
̃  are fuzzy points whose roots of  X̃ components 
are nearest to the concertation 𝐶. 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼 can be further represented by a linguistic variable, 
or it can be used directly in the aggregation process.  
A single fuzzy value 𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼 is obtained by applying some 
fuzzy aggregation operator (aggreg) to all (𝑛) components 
𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼 indices: 
 
𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼 = 𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔(𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑖), 𝑖 = 1, 𝑛  
 
To simplify the decision-making process and/or facilitate 
general understanding, a fuzzy linguistic variable defined by 
corresponding fuzzy sets can be easily introduced in such a 
model.  
C. 
Prediction model 
In our model, we opt for multivariate regression to forecast 
𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼. However, other classification methods can easily be 
incorporated in the proposed model. 
A prediction model in which the target variable consists of 
unordered classes is shown in Figure 4. 
The shortcoming of this approach is that the individual 
membership functions, that is, the fuzzy classes, are viewed as 
if they were independent variables, i.e., the fact that the Very 
low and Low classes are "closer" than the Very Low and 
Very High classes is not considered.

Figure 4.  Prediction model with target variable modeled by unordered classes 
 
 
To address this problem, this paper used the fact that 
classes can be arranged by the ordering relation: 
 
Very Low ≤ Low ≤ Medium ≤ Hight ≤Very High 
(   𝟎̃        ≤   𝟏̃     ≤       𝟐̃       ≤    𝟑̃     ≤       𝟒̃      ) 
 
If we represent the Very Low class with the fuzzy 
number 0̃ and the Very High class with the fuzzy number 
4̃ , then we can use the analogy with integers and real 
numbers, so the ordering could be like an ordering among 
integer numbers, and the extension of a strict class 
membership could be a Type 2 fuzzy membership over 
discourse 𝑅. Then, for example, the number 1.2 stands for 
a partial belonging to classes 1 and 2, which simultaneously 
reflects the arrangement of classes. This also expresses in a 
simpler way the fact: 
𝐹𝑗(𝐴𝑄𝐼) = 0 → 𝐹𝑖(𝐴𝑄𝐼) = 0, ∀𝑖, 𝑖 > 𝑗 
To implement this idea, we have introduced the notion 
of fuzzy relations ≤𝑅𝐹 and  ≤𝐿𝐹  .  
Definition 11. Let ℋ be a linear fuzzy space defined on 
𝑅1. Fuzzy relations ≤𝑅𝐹 and  ≤𝐿𝐹 on the set ℋ are defined 
by the following membership functions: 
𝜇(𝐴̃  ≤𝑅𝐹  𝐵̃) = 
{
 
 
1
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 > 𝐵
𝐵 − 𝐴
𝑟𝐵 − 𝑟𝐴
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 − 𝑟𝐴 > 𝐵 − 𝑟𝐵
0
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 − 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 − 𝑟𝐵
 
𝜇(𝐴̃  ≤𝐿𝐹  𝐵̃) = 
{
 
 
1
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 < 𝐵
𝐵 − 𝐴
𝑟𝐵 − 𝑟𝐴
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 − 𝑟𝐴 > 𝐵 − 𝑟𝐵
0
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 − 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 − 𝑟𝐵
 
where 𝐴̃ = (𝐴, 𝑟𝐴) and 𝐵 = (𝐵̃, 𝑟𝐵) are fuzzy points from 
ℋ , 𝐴   is the core of the point 𝐴̃  , 𝑟𝐴  is the parameter 
determining the membership function of the point 𝐴̃ , 𝐵  is 
the core of the point 𝐵̃ , and 𝑟𝐵 is the parameter determining 
the membership function of the point 𝐵̃. 
Also, we have formulated the following two theorems 
and proved the first one (the proof of the second is analogue 
to the first).  
Theorem 1. Let  𝑇𝑀 − equivalence  𝐸: ℋ × ℋ →
[0,1] is given by 
𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = {1
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐴 = 𝑟𝐵 
0
𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
 
and a minimum 𝑇𝑀 − norm  (𝑇𝑀(𝑎, 𝑏) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑎, 𝑏)) . 
Then the fuzzy relation  ≤𝑅𝐹 is an ordering compliant with 
Definition  4. 
Proof.  
The following notation will be used in the proof. With 
𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶 we shall denote the cores of the fuzzy points 𝐴̃,  𝐵̃ , 𝐶̃ 
and with 𝑟𝐴, 𝑟𝐵, 𝑟𝐶 corresponding maximal distances from 
the cores for which the membership functions are note 
zeroes.  
What we have to prove here is that the relation ≤𝑅𝐹 has the 
following properties: 
(i) E   Reflexivity 
       𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) ≤ 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) 
(ii) 𝑇𝑀 E Anti-symmetry      
𝑇𝑀 (𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃), 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐴̃)) ≤  𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) 
(iii) 𝑇𝑀 Transitivity 
      
𝑇𝑀 (𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃), 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃)) ≤  𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃) 
𝑬-Reflexivity 
If  𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = 0, the proof is trivial. If not, from 𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) =
1 , follows 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐴 = 𝑟𝐵  having the consequence 
𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) = 1 ⇒ 1 ≤ 1. 
𝑻𝑴 E-Anti-symmetry 
The proof is trivial for  𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = 1.  
If  𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = 0, it should be proved that 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) =
0 ∨ 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐴̃) = 0 is true.

Suppose that 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) ≠ 0 ∨ 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐴̃) ≠ 0 is true. 
By substituting 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) = 𝑎  and 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐴̃) = 𝑏 
we distinguish four cases. 
1) 𝒂 = 𝟏 ∧ 𝒃 = 𝟏: 
(𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵) ∧ (𝐵 ≤ 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵 ≤ 𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴) 
implies 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐴 = 𝑟𝐵 ⇒ 𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = 1 , which is not 
possible due to the assumption that 𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = 0. 
2) 𝒂 = 𝟏 ∧ 𝒃 < 𝟏: 
(𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵) ∧ (𝐵 ≤ 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵 ≤ 𝐴 +
𝑟𝐴)  implies 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝑟𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐵 > 𝑟𝐵, which is not 
possible. 
3) 𝒂 < 𝟏 ∧ 𝒃 = 𝟏: Analogous to the proof of case 2). 
4) 𝒂 < 𝟏 ∧ 𝒃 < 𝟏: 
(𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 > 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵) ∧ (𝐵 ≤ 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵 > 𝐴 +
𝑟𝐴)   implies 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐴 > 𝑟𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐵 < 𝑟𝐴 , which is not 
possible. 
𝑻𝑴 Transitivity 
It should be proven that, for each 𝐴̃, 𝐵̃, 𝐶̃  from ℋ 
defined over 𝑅1 , 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃), 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃)) ≤
𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃)  holds. With adopted notation, we can 
distinguish two cases:  
1) 𝐴 > 𝐵 ∨ 𝐵 > 𝐶 , and  
2) 𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐵 ≤ 𝐶. 
For 𝐴 > 𝐵 ∨ 𝐵 > 𝐶  the 
proof 
is 
trivial 
because 
𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) = 0 or 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃) = 0. 
For 𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐵 ≤ 𝐶 we distinguish two cases:  
1) 
𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝐶 + 𝑟𝐶  and   
2) 
𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 > 𝐶 + 𝑟𝐶 .  
1) The proof is trivial because of  𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃) = 1 .  
2) Let 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃) =
𝐶−𝐴
𝑟𝐶−𝑟𝐴 = 𝑎 < 1.  
Then, the inequality 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃), 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃)) ≤
𝑎 is true if 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) ≤ 𝑎 is true or 𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃) ≤ 𝑎 is 
true and, again, three cases emerge:  
(i) 𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 ≤ 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵;  
(ii)  𝐴 + 𝑟𝐴 > 𝐵 + 𝑟𝐵 ≥ 𝐶 + 𝑟𝐶;  
(iii) 𝐵 + 𝑟𝑩 < 𝐶 + 𝑟𝐶.  
For the case (i) 𝜇(𝐴̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐵̃) = 1, and for the case (iii) 
𝜇(𝐵̃ ≤𝑅𝐹 𝐶̃) = 1  the consequence of the previous 
statements are the following three cases:  
(i) 1 ≤ 𝑎 ∨ 
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶  ≤ 𝑎;  
(ii) 
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 ≤ 𝑎 ∨ 
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶 ≤ 𝑎;  
(iii) 
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 ≤ 𝑎 ∨ 1 ≤ 𝑎. 
Let’s continue with contradiction and suppose the 
opposite:  
(i) 1 > 𝑎 ∨ 
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶 > 𝑎;  
(ii) 
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 > 𝑎 ∨ 
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶 > 𝑎;  
(iii) 
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 > 𝑎 ∨ 1 > 𝑎.  
Then for (i) holds that 
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 ≥ 1 > 𝑎 ∧
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶 > 𝑎 , while 
for (iii) holds that 
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 > 𝑎 ∧
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶 ≥ 1 > 𝑎.  
We can represent the cases (i), (ii), and (iii) as  
𝐵−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐵 > 𝑎 ∧
𝐶−𝐵
𝑟𝐵−𝑟𝐶 > 𝑎,  
This leads to the consequence  
𝐵 − 𝐴 > 𝑎(𝑟𝐴 − 𝑟𝐵) ∧ (𝐶 − 𝐵) > 𝑎(𝑟𝐵 − 𝑟𝐶) ⇒ 𝐶 − 𝐴 >
𝑎(𝑟𝐴 − 𝑟𝐶),  i.e., 
𝐶−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐶 > 𝑎. 
However, this is not possible due to the assumption  
𝐶−𝐴
𝑟𝐴−𝑟𝐶 = 𝑎 █ 
Theorem 2. Let  𝑇𝑀 − equivalence  𝐸: ℋ × ℋ →
[0,1] is given by 
𝐸(𝐴̃, 𝐵̃) = {1
𝑖𝑓 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∧ 𝑟𝐴 = 𝑟𝐵 
0
𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
 
and a minimum 𝑇𝑀 − norm  (𝑇𝑀(𝑎, 𝑏) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑎, 𝑏)) . 
Then the fuzzy relation  ≤𝐿𝐹 is an ordering compliant with 
Definition  4. 
The proof of Theorem 2 is analogous to the proof of 
Theorem 1. 
Figure 5 shows the mapping between the unordered set 
of fuzzy membership functions and the new, ordered 
classes.

Figure 5.  Modeling ordered classes  
 
The mapping is modeled through the weighted sum 
aggregation operator, which is defined as 
 
𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼 = ∑ 𝑖
4
𝑖=0
⋅ 𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖(𝐴𝑄𝐼) 
 
where 𝑖 is the integer number standing for the classes (0 for 
Very Low, 1 for Low, 2 for Medium, 3 for High and 4 for 
Very High) and 𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖(𝐴𝑄𝐼) is the value of the function of 
the measurement sample belonging to class 𝑖 . 
 
That way we obtain the prediction model in which, instead 
of five output values, we have a single value that captures 
interactions of five independent quantities, while keeping 
the computational complexity same as that for unordered 
classes. 
The resulting prediction model is shown in Figure 6.

To be able to compare the ordered and unordered case, 
it is necessary to calculate the total error as the mean value 
of the error of the example for all classes, which is 
calculated as: 
 
𝐸𝑟𝑟 = 1
𝑛 ∑ 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑖 ∙
4
𝑖=0
∑ 𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑖(𝐴𝑄𝐼𝑗)

V. MODEL APPLICATION AND SIMULATION RESULTS 
To present the proposed model/methodology, we ran an 
experiment on a large and diverse data set. The used data 
set contains more than 82000 samples each with 385 real 
values. GDAS values are interpolated to fit five geo 
locations and merged with measurements of the 
concentration of the air pollutants. 
For our experiment we used a virtual machine (VM) 
created as part of PARADOX HP Proliant SL250s with 
following components: Intel Xeon Processors E5-2670 
(Sandy Bridge, 8 Core, 20M Cache, 2.6GHz), 106 nodes 
with total 1696 CPU cores and 32GB per node. Our VM is 
configured to use 8 cores and 32GB RAM on Debian 
GNU/Linux 10, Architecture x86-64.  
All experiments were implemented using Python with 
Tensorflow 2.0, Pandas, XGBoost and Scikit-Learn main 
packages. 
A. 
Data set 
In this experiment, we used five data sets from five 
distinct locations in the USA, each in the same format. The 
sources of data are  [32] (measurements of the concentration 
of the air pollutants) and [33] (meteorological data). 
Samples are indexed by temporal attribute, datetime, 
ranging from January 1, 2015. to December 31, 2021. All 
ten meteorological GDAS and six air pollutants are stored 
in a 24 hours’ time slot with 1h sample rate (385 real values 
in total). Table III presents the data in more detail including 
sample sizes per location.

Fuzzy air quality index 
In this example of framework application, the fuzzy air 
quality index is modelled via a simple max aggregation 
function applied to five 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼 indices of each criteria air 
pollutants: 
𝐹𝐴𝑄𝐼
= 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝐶𝑂, 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑃𝑀10, 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑂2, 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑂3, 𝐹𝑃𝑆𝐼𝑆𝑂2) 
Finally, we introduce a fuzzy linguistic variable (Very 
low, Low, Medium, High, Very high) defined by 
corresponding fuzzy sets, as depicted in Figure 7. 
This fuzzy linguistic variable actually corresponds to 
the definition of CAQI, which describes air quality through 
these five categories. However, individual countries apply 
different scales (for example, Canada has a scale with four 
categories, while the USA has scale with six categories).  
It is obvious that in our model this index can easily be 
adapted to specific needs.  
 
 
Figure 7.  Fuzzy CAQI  
 
C. 
ML experiments 
In our experiments, we applied four multivariate 
regressors.  
The first multivariate predictor regressor in this 
experiment is XGBoostRegressor with 24*10 GDAS and 
24*6 air pollutant variables as input, and 5 real valued 
outputs, each corresponding to a single fuzzy set 
(FAQI_very low to very high), as depicted in Figure 3. Data 
set is split up into train (80%) and test (20%) subsets and 
trained with 1000 estimators with max_depth 4 and enabled 
early stopping method to avoid overfitting.  
The second multivariate predictor regressor in this 
experiment is a deep neural network with 24*10 GDAS and 
24*6 air pollutant variables as input, and 5 real valued 
outputs, each corresponding to a single fuzzy set 
(FAQI_very low to very high), with one hidden layer 
consisting of 20 Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) nodes. The 
activation functions in output layer are Sigmoid. The data 
set is split up into train (80%) and test (20%) subsets. Two 
dropout layers with 10% random filters are incepted 
between active layers to prevent overfitting.  
The third multivariate predictor regressor in this 
experiment is ADA Boost regressor with 100 estimators, 
learning rate 1 and boosting algorithm SAMME.R.  
The fourth multivariate predictor regressor in this 
experiment is Histogram gradient boosting regressor with 
squared error loss function, learning rate 0.1, max iterations 
100, max leaf nodes 31, min samples leaf numbers 20, 
without regularization and max bins 255. 
D. 
Simulation results 
The mean absolute errors for FAQI prediction with 
unordered classes are shown in Table VI (XGBoost), Table 
VII (Deep Neural Network), Table VIII (ADA Boost), and 
Table IX (Histogram gradient boosting). 
The tables show that all regressors behave similarly. 
Moreover, they are good in prediction for categories 
Medium, High and Very high and poor in prediction for 
categories Very low and Low. Having that in mind and the 
main purpose of the FAQI to alert of dangerous air pollution 
(High and Very high, possibly Medium), the results showed 
that further research was needed and justified.

Simulation results for the target variable modelled as 
independent classes show that this model is characterized 
by a distinct property, which is a satisfactory performance 
for higher values of air quality index, and significantly 
worse (mean absolute errors higher for an order of 
magnitude) performance for lower values. In that case, the 
overall mean absolute prediction error was between 0.403 
and 0.457 (except for the data set 32-003-0540 with mean 
absolute error of 0.11). This was a notable deficiency of the 
model calling for improvement that should ensure at least 
approximately equal performance for all categories.  
Simulation results for the model in which the target 
variable is modelled as a set of ordered classes showed 
better performance. In this case, the overall mean absolute 
prediction error was between 0.114 and 0.160 (except for 
the data set 32-003-0540 with mean absolute error of 
0.295), and the maximum error (again for the low pollution 
value classes) was of the same order of magnitude as for the 
high pollution value classes. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a framework aimed at forecasting 
the aggregated air pollution index that is based on our 
Linear fuzzy space theory and fuzzy aggregation operators. 
The proposed model consists of two sub models. The first 
one models the concentration of pollutants, while the 
second one models multi-contaminant air quality index. We 
model the concentration of pollutants by regression using 
fuzzy time series of two groups of data: measured 
concentrations of pollutants and meteorological parameters 
with the target variable modeled in two ways. In the first 
case, the target variable consists of independent classes 
defined by proper membership functions, while in the 
second case, it is modeled by a set of classes connected by 
an ordering relation. The multi-contaminant air quality 
index is modeled as a fuzzy aggregation of PSI obtained via 
fuzzy linear transformation defined by fuzzy breakpoints.  
Simulation results for the target variable modelled as 
unordered classes show that this model is characterized by 
a distinct property, which is a satisfactory performance for 
higher values of air quality index, and significantly worse 
(mean absolute errors higher for an order of magnitude) 
performance for lower values. This was a notable deficiency 
of the model calling for improvement that should ensure at 
least approximately equal performance for all categories. 
To improve the model performance, we model the target 
class as a set of ordered classes, which gave better 
performance in terms of mean absolute error.

However, air pollution is a result of an extremely 
complex and interdependent interaction among multiple 
factors (air pollutants, environment, time, climate 
conditions, etc.) additionally burdened with uncertainty and 
imprecision in data. This makes a single index an extremely 
rough approximation of the considered pollution situation.  
Indeed, there is a potential for improvements in the 
research topics tackled in this paper, which shapes further 
research directions. The possible improvements could be 
further divided into two rough partitions.  
The first, which is of fundamental kind, is about 
rethinking the air pollution index concept (for example, 
making 
it 
contextually 
dependent, 
or 
making 
it 
multidimensional). Recent research related to aggregation 
of sequence of fuzzy measures [34] and distortion functions 
[35] could provide for further improvement of the air 
pollution index modelling.  
The second one is more about "technical" improvements 
of the model proposed in this paper: use of additional 
variables (like those in Table IV), training data balancing 
(in our experiment clearly indicated by results obtained for 
the data set 32-003-0540), learning shapes of membership 
functions from historical data, and alike. Improvements 
should specifically address creation of precision metrics in 
linear fuzzy space, enabling estimations of sensitivity of 
interval partitions selection in time series, aggregation 
models, and fuzzy sets parameters. Recent theory 
development (see [36], [37]) gives a method for 
identification of the optimal solution for convex and non-
convex optimization in fuzzy approach that could help to do 
this. 
The two partitions intersect at utilization of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) methods, particularly fuzzy approach 
relying upon Linear fuzzy space and other stuff concerning 
imprecision and ambiguity management, and machine 
learning techniques.
