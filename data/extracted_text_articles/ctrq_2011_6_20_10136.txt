Abstract—Reliability has become a greater concern in recent 
years, because high-tech industrial processes with ever 
increasing levels of sophistication comprise most engineering 
systems today. Reliability Allocation Method currently used 
has corresponding advantages in different aspects, but there 
are still some limitations in practical engineering applications. 
It is difficult to establish the mission reliability models for 
large and complex system while facing the degradation use in 
function, dynamic correlation between structural composition 
and faults not meeting the independent assumptions, and other 
cases. Based on the analysis of the advantages and 
disadvantages of the traditional reliability allocation methods, 
this paper described in details the mission reliability allocation 
method of complex system by applying simulation. It can not 
only conduct a great deal of iteration calculation but also can 
weigh different allocation schemes without adding additional 
work, 
using 
simulation 
calculations 
after 
the 
initial 
establishment of system simulation models. This is suitable for 
the mission reliability allocation of complex systems in

 INTRODUCTION 
Reliability has become an ever greater concern in recent 
years, because high-tech industrial processes with ever 
increasing 
levels 
of 
sophistication 
comprise 
most 
engineering systems today. Reliability allocation is an 
important link of system reliability design. Reliability 
allocation is to allocate reliability indicators provided by the 
system to subsystems, parts and components according to 
certain principles and procedures so as to enable designers at 
all levels to identify its reliability design requirements, 
accurately estimate manpower, time and resources according 
to the requirements and study the possibility of achieving 
this requirement and methods. It is a decomposition process 
from the integral to part, from big to small and from top to 
bottom.  Reliability allocation can be used in the design of 
both hardware system and software. While most of 
literatures present how to do the reliability allocation for 
hardware design a method of reliability allocation for 
software and network is described in [1, 2]. 
Reliability allocation includes basic reliability allocation 
and mission reliability allocation. Currently, reliability 
allocation is carried out mainly by constrained system 
reliability allocation method and unconstrained reliability 
allocation method. The former mainly includes Lagrange 
multiplier method, dynamic programming method, and 
direct search method; while the latter mainly includes equal 
allocation method, combination in proportion technique and 
score allocation method [3], and it also includes some 
methods deriving from above for the score is more  rational, 
such as Fuzzy Decision Method [4,5], AHP [6], using the 
maximal entropy ordered weighted averaging method [7], 
Analytical Target Cascading Method [8], sensitivity 
evaluation method [9] and so on. Unconstrained allocation 
method is frequently used in engineering. The use of all 
these methods often needs to establish the reliability model. 
It is very easy to build the basic reliability model of the 
system, such as series model; However, it is often difficult to 
establish the mission reliability model for large and complex 
system due to complexity of its structure, complexity in 
functions to be achieved, degradation use in function and 
dynamic correlation between structural composition, faults 
not meeting the independent assumptions, and other cases. 
This results in difficulties in the use of above methods. In 
this case, this paper, based on simulation ideas [10,11], puts 
forward the simulation-based reliability allocation method in 
order to achieve the mission reliability allocation for 
complex system. This method establishes not the mission 
reliability model but the simulation logic model of the 
system by defectively using functional logical relationship 
between product units, which can be widely applied in 
engineering. 
In this paper, Section Ⅱ introduces the overview of 
reliability allocation method frequently used. And then the 
simulation-based mission reliability allocation for complex 
system, including allocation idea and allocation process are 
detailed in Section Ⅲ. At last, it is a case study.

RELIABILITY ALLOCATION METHOD FREQUENTLY 
USED 
Reliability allocation is the process of decomposing 
reliability indicators of the top-level system to the 
underlying unit step by step in the product design phase. In 
the course of the reliability allocation process, various 
methods should follow some common basic principles 
[12,13], such as:

The initiative and 
engineering experience of 
personnel can be given 
into full play, and score 
results has a certain 
convergence  
Only scoring a few aspects 
of indicators, the results 
cover incomplete 
information 
 Allocate lower reliability value to higher-
complexity subsystems and equipment; 
 Allocate lower reliability value to equipment with 
immature technology; 
 Allocate lower reliability value to the equipment 
working in difficult  environmental conditions; 
 Allocate lower reliability value to products in 
service for long term; 
 Allocate relatively higher reliability value to 
products with higher importance; 
 Allocate relatively higher reliability value to 
products difficult to repair and replace; 
 On-shelf products that have reliability value or 
systems that have been used sophisticatedly will 
not be allocated with new reliability value in 
design phrase, while it is required to remove the 
reliability value of these units from the total index 
then allocate the remnant reliability value to other 
systems. 
Mainly due to different considerations and different 
premise of data application, different reliability allocation 
methods have different accuracy of their results. Frequently-
used reliability allocation methods and their characteristics 
[14,15] are as shown in Table 1. 
Although these above methods have corresponding 
advantages in different aspects, but there are still limitations 
in practical engineering applications: 
1) Logical complexity of system functions. Owing to 
the interconnect, backup, timing and other related relations 
between functions of various system component units, the 
underlying units could not meet the fault independence 
assumption. Therefore the existing series, parallel, by-pass, 
bridging and voting and other reliability models could not 
describe the whole system mission reliability; 
2) System reliability could not be calculated by the 
existing formula due to system and component unit life 
expectation does not obey the exponential distribution. 
Analytic deduction of other types of distributions is too 
complicated; 
3) Each result of reliability allocation needs to be 
verified, the reliability allocation work can be put to an end 
if only the requirements are satisfied. But this process is too 
long for complex systems which require iterative 
calculation [16]. 
III. 
SIMULATION-BASED MISSION RELIABILITY 
ALLOCATION OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS 
A. Allocation ideas 
Reliability allocation and reliability prediction are two 
inverse processes, while the latter is used to validate the 
reasonableness of the results of reliability allocation. 
Simulation-based reliability allocation method of complex 
systems just uses this idea, i.e. in the case of a known initial 
value of reliability allocation, using the prediction method to 
obtain the simulation-based system reliability value and 
determine whether the initial requirements of allocation can 
be meet; if not so, it is required to regulate the values 
obtained in the current allocation according to the equipment 
importance or system weaknesses and other factors obtained 
from the simulation analysis, and then conduct prediction 
again until system requirement can be satisfied. This method 
does not require establishing the mission reliability model of 
the system while directly employs the criterion for system 
failure to building simulation models for the complex 
functional logic relationship and timing relationship between 
systems, which is applicable to any allocation types 
including exponential allocation. As a result of simulation-
based calculations, after the initial establishment of system 
simulation models, we can conduct a lot of iterations and 
also weigh different allocation schemes without adding 
additional work. Therefore, it is suitable for the use in 
reliability allocation of complex systems in the engineering 
project. 
B. Allocation process 
Simulation-based reliability allocation mainly complies 
with the following steps: 
First, make clear the definition of the system mission and 
establish fault criteria, which is the basis of the entire 
simulation. Simulation model can be established accurately 
123
CTRQ 2011 : The Fourth International Conference on Communication Theory, Reliability, and Quality of Service
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2011.     ISBN: 978-1-61208-126-7

only different missions have been given a clear definition of 
fault criteria. Therefore, the definition of fault criteria must 
be clear enough: what unit works on what time phase, what 
is the influence of unit fault on the mission－the system 
fault or functional degradation, as well as what kind of 
combination and what kind of timing of each unit fault will 
lead to system fault. 
Secondly, build simulation models based on the system 
functional logical relationship and fault criteria. 
Thirdly, obtain the initial allocation value of the 
underlying unit by using conventional reliability allocation 
method. At this stage, if there is a known basic reliability 
requirements of the system, the result of basic reliability 
allocation can be used as the initial value assigned, so that 
the mission reliability allocation can be conducted under the 
premise of guaranteeing the basic reliability requirements so 
as to reduce the number of iterations. 
Then, use the initial allocation value as an input of 
simulation model to run the simulation, and thereby compute 
the reliability of top system. 
Finally, determine whether the top system reliability can 
meet the requirements; if not so, it is required to re-regulate 
reliability values of the underlying unit and then continue 
the simulation by iteration method until the requirement can 
be satisfied. In the process of values regulation, take 
importance factors into account so as to efficiently and 
rationally complete reliability allocation process [17]. 
Using the device as the underlying unit, the specific 
simulation algorithm is as shown in Figure 1.

(2) Read the database to obtain the initial value of Mean 
Time Between Critical Fault (MTBCF) of each

value, reliability, device importance and the mode 
importance. Importance reflects the importance 
degree of device in system. Mode importance is 
used to identify the weakness in system. 
As the system fault time values are generated by random 
sampling, it is necessary to conduct statistical analysis for 
these values after N times of simulation. Suppose the 
maximum working hours of the system is

and equally 
divide it into several intervals (setting as m), then each time

APPLICATION OF WARSHIP SYSTEMS CASES 
Take Warship Integrated Platform Management System 
as an example to do the reliability allocation. 
A. System description and mission failure criterion 
1) System Description 
Warship Integrated Platform Management System is a 
very important system in warships, which is mainly used for 
warship implementing real-time monitoring, control and 
management over main systems (equipment) on the platform. 
This system contains eight sub-systems including 16 types 
and 82 equipments in total. Among them, one is a ship-
borne computer which does not need to be allocated new 
reliability value and four equipments can be used as backup 
units for backup related equipments in all sub-systems. Thus 
between the different sub-system does not conform to the 
faults independent assumptions. There are series, parallel, n 
out of r and some fault correlation between interior 
equipments of different sub-systems. Therefore, it is very 
difficult to establish the system reliability models using 
conventional methods. We can describe the system in 
simulation method presented in 3.2. 
2) Mission reliability requirements 
MTBCF of Integrated Platform Management System is 
required to be 2000 hours. 
3) Mission fault criterion 
Warship working process will have different mission 
profiles. Under the corresponding different mission profiles, 
warship integrated platform management system has 
different working condition and fault criteria. For a typical 
mission profile, each sub-system will respectively achieve 
different functions. As a result, if any sub-system was in 
fault, the entire system functions could not be achieved. In 
the interior of sub-systems, some equipments fault will not 
lead to complete loss of functions of sub-systems but lead to 
functional degradation; fault relation exists between some 
equipments. 
Taking No. 6 sub-system as an example, which includes 
No.75~No.79 equipment, No.17, No.51, No.52 and No.80 
are four general-purpose backup units mentioned above, 
they are in other sub-systems and can backup No.75 
equipment. Then, the fault criterion of No.6 subsystem is as 
follows: one of No.75~No.79 equipment is in fault, or No.75, 
No.17, No.51, No.52 and No.80 all get malfunctions. 
B. Establish the simulation model of mission reliability 
System mission reliability simulation model could be 
established according to the mission criteria. Functional 
faults correlations in No. 2 and No.6 subsystems are as 
shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In the graphics, the figure in 
box respectively represents equipment serial number. No. 51, 
No. 52 and No. 80 equipment do not belong to No. 2 sub-
systems, but they can achieve backup for No. 17 equipment 
in the sub-system, so we can consider that they follow 1out 
of 4 relationship. After identifying functional fault 
correlations between various sub-systems, by following the 
series relationship between sub-systems, we can create 
reliability simulation model of the entire system, that is, the 
combination of functional faults and timing between what 
equipment can lead to system fault. System simulation 
model could be established according to the functional faults 
correlations in system, and then simulated program could be 
compiled according to the algorithm shown in figure 1. The 
partial codes are as follows.

allocation can be carried out in series model using score 
allocation method, and the result shall be taken as the initial 
value of simulation-based mission reliability allocation. 
Considering the complexity and working hours, the result of 
reliability allocation in series model is as shown in Table 3. 
The same type of equipment could be allocated with the 
same value.

D. Run the simulation to obtain the final value of reliability 
allocation 
Substitute initial reliability allocation values of various 
equipments into simulation model and run the simulation, 
and then obtain the system MTBCF up to 6630.548 hours, 
which is far greater than 2,000 hours as required by the 
system, so it is required to appropriately reduce the 
reliability index of some equipment. The main principles of 
adjustment: equipment with high importance, weakness 
links in systems shall reserve relatively higher reliability 
index; equipment assigned with unduly high reliability index 
probably could not be achieved in the project, so the 
reliability index should be appropriately reduced based on 
the actual situation. 
According to the sequence of equipment importance and 
vulnerability in the system obtained in the first round of 
simulation (see Table 2), based on the practical application 
of actual engineering projects, we can regulate MTBCF 
values of some equipment and obtain system MTBCF 
2247.826 hours after several rounds of iterations, so the 
current initial value can meet the requirements of mission 
reliability allocation, then reliability allocation work can be 
ended. The final allocation results are as shown in Table 4. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Using existing common methods to conduct system 
reliability allocation will be constrained in different aspects 
to varying degrees; especially in the case of complex system 
mission reliability allocation, some methods even could not 
solve the practical problems. However, in the case of using 
digital simulation ideas to conduct complex system mission 
reliability allocation, as long as the system mission and 
functions are identified, we can establish a system 
simulation model and further conveniently conduct 
verification on the results of complex system mission 
reliability allocation by using the initial allocation index of 
various underlying units, and meanwhile acquire the 
information of importance of various units, mission 
reliability and MTBCF of the whole system and various 
subsystems. In addition, this method can guarantee the 
correctness of multiple iterations testing and applies to 
application in practical engineering. 
Using simulation-based complex system reliability 
allocation method is required to established corresponding 
simulation models for different application objects, which 
requires that engineering staff shall not only have a deep 
understanding of system functions prior to the establishment 
of simulation model, but also certain programming 
capabilities so as to ensure the correctness of establishing 
logic simulation models. Therefore, the research on general-
purpose modeling simulation of complex systems can be 
further carried out in order to better apply to engineering 
projects.
