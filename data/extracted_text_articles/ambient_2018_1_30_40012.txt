Abstract—This paper presents a novel life monitoring system
using a home agent and ambient sensors as invisible sensors
that ﬁt living circumstances with consideration of privacy and
Quality of Life (QoL) for achieving autonomous monitoring in
daily life. The home agent has a key tag sensor, a human detection
sensor, and a remote control sensor for detecting the states of a
subject, such as going out (Out) or being at home (Home). The
ambient sensors consist of a pad sensor installed in a bed sheet,
a triaxial accelerometer inserted in a pillow, a human detection
sensor installed near an entrance door, and a piezoelectric sensor
installed near a refrigerator. The state of Home or sleeping on
a bed (Sleep) is detected using ambient sensors that measure
living behavior patterns in real time. As a preliminary experiment
aimed at monitoring various life patterns of elderly people,
we conducted a monitoring experiment during two months for
four university students subjects in their 20s. For this system,
sensor signals were stored in a server via a wireless router for
visualization on a monitoring computer terminal in real time.
We developed a method of recognizing three major life patterns
( Out, Home, and Sleep) using machine learning which uses eight
algorithms. To evaluate of recognition accuracy, we collected
handwritten daily records from the respective subjects used
for correct behavior datasets as ground truth. Experimentally
obtained results revealed that the mean recognition accuracy was
83.61% for the ﬁrst half of the monitoring experiment during
one month with one-minute downsampled signal intervals. In
the last half of the monitoring experiment, data acquisition was
interrupted because of a failure of the home agent. We continued
the evaluation experiment of life patterns with two delimited
periods, which indicated recognition accuracies of 92.53% for 18
days and 93.85% for 27 days.

INTRODUCTION
Because of the rapid progress of aging societies and
increased longevity worldwide, mutual support among gener-
ations has already reached its limit, as reﬂected in distortion
of the population pyramids of many nations. The problems
of increased numbers of single elderly people, nursing care
among care receivers, rarefaction of regional ties, isolation, and
marginalization are manifested not only in regional cities and
country sides with high aging rates, but also in metropolitan
areas with higher population concentrations. For monitoring
elderly people from remote areas, the development of in-
formation and communication systems, supporting devices,
and sensor systems is underway [1]. In particular, security
measures to prevent elderly people from a solitary death is
urgent in our current society [2].
Particularly, life-support and service robot platforms with
communication and interactive functions, along with sensing
and monitoring using unconstrained and invisible sensors have
been unveiled, offering advanced functionality and perfor-
mance [3]. These systems are able to monitor several subjects
as care receivers in parallel; subjects are assumed to be in
nursing facilities focusing on monitoring functions. Moreover,
these systems can be used for 24 hours continuously if
malfunction is avoided. The advantage of these systems is to
send notiﬁcations containing information simultaneously and
instantly to nurses, caregivers, and family members. These
autonomous systems do not require so much as the push of a
button or raising one’s voice to collect active information.
For specialized sleep monitoring, sensor systems that send
notiﬁcations with information related to bed leaving behaviors
to care takers or nurses are already in practical use [4]. More-
over, robotic nursing care devices with a monitoring function
used for elderly people who have Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI) [5] have been developed. Evaluation methods and
criteria have already been established [6]. Various criteria and
speciﬁcations exist for monitoring sensor systems according to
use cases and situations of use. The most important function is
automatic and immediate notiﬁcation of abnormal or unusual
information related to care. Contingent circumstances occur if
automatic notiﬁcation is delayed.
As a novel approach to overcome these problems, moni-
toring systems that speciﬁcally examine life pattern rhythms
in our daily life have been studied [7]. Actually, humans have
individual life rhythms related to health, mind, and mentality.
Particularly for elderly people, unsteady or confusing life
rhythms cause bad effects of sleep deprivation related to health.
Therefore, we infer that monitoring systems can detect the
health conditions of elderly people immediately if life rhythms
can be extracted using monitoring support systems.
This paper presents a novel life-pattern monitoring system
using multiple hidden sensors for adaption to daily life with
respect to privacy and Quality of Life (QoL). Our proposed
system comprises a home agent and ambient sensors. The
home agent has a key tag detection sensor, a motion sensor,
and a remote controller detection sensor for recognition of
a monitored person as home or out. The ambient sensor

comprises pad-shape sensors installed in a bed sheet, a triaxial
accelerometer installed in a pillow, a motion sensor installed
near a door, and piezoelectric ﬁlm sensor installed in a refrig-
erator. The ambient sensor measures life behavior patterns at
home to determine normal home behavior or sleeping in a bed.
Monitored signals are saved on a server using network storage
via a wireless router with a visualizing function of signal
outputs in real time from respective sensors. As a preliminary
experiment before monitoring diverse life patterns of elderly
people, we conducted a monitoring experiment for two months
to observe four university students subjects. Moreover, we at-
tempted to recognize life patterns from collected datasets using
machine learning algorithms. This report presents details of
related studies, our proposed system, and recognition results.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, related studies are presented, especially for smart sensors
and daily life monitoring systems. Sections III and IV present
our proposed method and experimental results obtained using
our original datasets, respectively. Finally, Section V concludes
and highlights future work.
II.
RELATED STUDIES
Various methods and experimentally obtained results of
daily life monitoring have been reported in earlier studies.
From results of a recent study report, Morishita et al. [8]
described a monitoring system that detected opening or closing
of a door using a magnet sensor with a function to report
the safety of a resident and an application to display sensor
detection results. Although they conducted a practical test at a
residence for low-income elderly people, monitoring results
reﬂected merely movements between rooms through doors.
Jiang et al. [9] proposed a monitoring system for use in nursing
care facilities. They obtained original datasets related to daily
habits in terms of eating and exercise using a dual-band Radio
Frequency IDentiﬁer (RFID) and virtual routing locational
algorithms. They revealed that their proposed system, which
included hush functions and certiﬁcation protocols, provided
high security with real-time processing. Although they revealed
that the total burden of waiting data calculation and commu-
nication was low, this result merely reﬂected results from a
computer simulation.
Park et al. [10] proposed a framework of a healthcare
monitoring system for elderly people using wearable sensors.
Their knowledge-based method with self-learning algorithms
collected sensor signals in real time while maintaining network
security. Nevertheless, they only proposed a framework with-
out conducting evaluation experiments or system implemen-
tation. Sumalan et al. [11] proposed a vital sign monitoring
system in terms of heart rates, respiratory rates, and blood
pressure for elderly people using wireless sensor networks.
Although their design concept was set as cost effective for
actualizing an application, their proposal remained a system
structure without experimentally obtained results.
Ghayvat et al. [12] proposed a daily life monitoring sys-
tem using electric current sensors, load sensors, and contact
sensors. They developed an original model to discriminate be-
tween normal or abnormal status. Furthermore, they conducted
an evaluation experiment at an elderly home and a nursing
care facility. However, the results remained a single tendency
of time-series visualization because their study was geared
towards the development of communication circumstances for

smart homes based on wireless networks and Internet of Things
(IoT).
Although they described details of the experimental setups,
especially related to use at nursing care facilities, the experi-
mentally obtained results were insufﬁcient for a practical use.
As an example of research related to MCI, Mighali et
al. [13] proposed a system of monitoring elderly behavior
patterns. It incorporated wearable sensors and motion sensors
installed in a home. The experimentally obtained results re-
vealed that the mean recognition accuracy achieved 97% for
10 healthy subjects at a living circumstance in a general house.
Nevertheless, the recognition targets were merely two patterns
of static or dynamic states. Furthermore, the consideration
of QoL was insufﬁcient because the system used wearable
sensors. Riboni et al. [14] proposed an ambient sensor system
that was composed of wearable sensors and home sensors
installed inside of electrical appliances. They conducted a
practical test for the target of elderly people with MCI. How-
ever, the experimentally obtained results remained extraction
of abnormal values without extracting patterns related to life
rhythms. They merely reported discussion of a plan for the
practical test without addressing details of experimentally
obtained results.
Moreover, numerous international projects consisting of
sensor networks and mobile robot prototypes have been con-
ducted in terms of DOREMI (Decrease of cOgnitive decline,
malnutRition and sedEntariness by elderly empowerment in
lifestyle Management and social Inclusion) [15], RUBICON
(for Robotic UBIquitous COgnitive Network) [16], and OP-
PORTUNITY (Activity and Context Recognition with Oppor-
tunistic Sensor Conﬁgurations) [17].

sensor, and a remote control sensor. Figure 2 shows that the
key sensor using a RFID-based wireless frequency Integrated
Circuit (IC) card induction sensor (MFRC-522 RC522) detects
the key status that was placed on the home agent. The motion
sensor using a collecting electron type InfRared (IR) sensor
module (SB612A) was installed to the front panel of the home
agent. The remote control sensor using an IR module (SPS-
440) was installed beside the motion sensor.
1) Home agent: We used a micro-controller board with
Raspberry Pi 3 model B (BCM2837) as the main processing
unit of the home agent. We implemented software to send the
collected sensor signals to a router in a ﬁxed interval using
a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) of 802.11 b/g/n on
a processing board. The board is equipped with an optional
board (BME280) used for ambient sensors in terms of a
temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, an atmospheric air
sensor, and an illumination sensor. For this study, we did not
use these sensors.
The sensor case is 120 mm wide, 199 mm long, and 35

mm high. Herein, the smartphone on the case top is used for a
demonstration. Using a tethering function of the smartphone,
the obtained sensor signals, which are collected with the home
agent, can be sent to network storage. For this study, we sent
sensor signals using a mobile wireless router.
2) Ambient sensors: Our proposed ambient sensor system
comprises pad-shape sensors installed on a bed, a triaxial
accelerometer installed in a pillow, a motion sensor installed
near a door, and a piezoelectric sensor installed in the door
of a refrigerator. Figure 3 depicts the bed sensor proposed
in a report of our earlier study [19]. It was manufactured
using a piezoelectric ﬁlm based on our prototype sensor
aimed at detecting bed leaving behavior. We used up to six
sensors because the use is intended solely for detecting bed-
leaving behaviors. For this study, we optimized the minimum
structure for detecting the subject’s status on a bed to recognize
sleeping behavior patterns. As an optimized result, we used
two channels after removing the detection of the body rolling
over.
As hidden sensors, we installed bed sensors to the backside
of the bed sheet. The sensor can be used not only with a
bed, but also with a futon, a Japanese style bed, because of
the installation on a sheet, which differs from existing sensors
installed on the bed frame [20]. For this implementation, we
sewed the sensor pads to a bed sheet near the hip part with a
pocket for avoiding drift of the sensor position.
For a pillow sensor, we directly implemented a triaxial ac-
celerometer (LIS3DSHTR) on a sensor board. Figure 4 depicts
the pillow sensor and its implementation inside of a pillow
after digging a hole from the backside. This sensor works
as a transmitter to notify the system of urgent information
of unusual body condition triggered by pillow movement. We
proposed the basic design of the pillow sensor in our earlier
study [19]. This is a revised model obtained after changing
the size and wireless communication method from ZigBee
to WI-FI. For the current implementation, an electric power
cable is extended from the pillow to electric power supply. For
dissemination, we will change it to a wireless power supply
method.
Figure 5 depicts a refrigerator sensor: our originally devel-
oped sensor prototype was created by attaching a piezoelectric
ﬁlm to a door of the refrigerator. In our daily life, a refrigerator
is frequently used as a home electrical appliance. Numerous
models of refrigerators exist with diverse structures in terms
of a freezer, a cold room, and a vegetable room. For this study,
our measurement target is the door of a cold room, which has
the highest frequency of opening or closing.
Figure 6 depicts a motion sensor: a similar sensor installed
in the home agent, near an entrance door. For all sensor boards,
we used a WI-FI module (ESP-WROOM-02) for a wireless
connection as the assumption of IoT applications. Moreover,
we installed them into a plastic case to avoid attachment on
the bared board for purposes of durability because we used
the sensor system for monitoring subjects at a home or other
residence.
B. Method of recognizing life patterns
For this study, we attempted to recognize life patterns based
on machine learning methods for monitoring signals obtained
from sensors. Actually, deep learning, for which a framework

was proposed by Hinton et al. [21], constructed a recognizer
automatically based on unsupervised learning of repeated
iterations using a huge dataset without annotation. Because
of high generalization capability for unlearned datasets, deep
learning has been applied widely to various ﬁelds, especially
in computer vision problems. By contrast, plenty of calculation
resources are necessary, especially for learning of large-scale
neural networks with multiple layers, even more than ten
layers.
As an enhanced combination, transfer learning [25] is used
to reduce the burden of learning if recognition targets are
generic objects [22], outdoor or indoor scenes [23], or text
mining [24]. In contrast, it is a challenging task to obtain
weights learned in advance as transfer learning because of the
use of original sensors for this study. Therefore, we compared
traditional machine learning algorithms used for a recognizer;
such algorithms are used widely before the dissemination of
deep learning.
Comparison algorithms are of eight types: Gaussian Naive
Bayes (GNB) [26], AdaBoost (AB) [27], k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) [28], Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) [29], Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) [30], Logistic Regression (LR) [31],
Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) [32], and Random
Forest (RF) [33]. We selected the best performance algorithm
from the criteria of recognition accuracy and calculation speed
with cross validation [34] using a similar dataset.
IV.
EVALUATION EXPERIMENT
A. Datasets
The aim of this study is to realize a smart sensor system
for monitoring elderly people for providing relief and safety
combined with privacy and QoL using invisible sensors. As
a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of our
proposed system, sensor signals and Ground Truth (GT) labels
are necessary for constructing a recognition model. Based on
the main user for this system for this preliminary experiment,
elderly people, we obtained monitoring datasets and their GT
based on life records obtained from healthy university students
who live in an apartment. The number of subjects was four
persons in their 20s.
Before obtaining monitoring datasets, we underwent an
ethics approval review by our university to obtain human
data. After receiving approval, we orally explained the purpose
and agreement of this research to subjects using a handout
that contains the same contents. We prepared an installation
manual for setting up the home agent and ambient sensors.
After installation, we veriﬁed the respective systems in their
residence using photographs taken using the camera of a
smartphone. No particular difﬁculty was encountered related
to installation or assignment.
All subjects wrote their life records used for GT with
obtaining monitoring signals from respective sensors. The
recording contents comprise event times of seven patterns:
getting up, sleeping, going out, coming home, emergency calls,
opening or closing of a refrigerator, and the use of a TV remote
control. They used a format to write them with the resolution
of minutes from a radio-controlled clock.
Herein, the consistency of life records depended on the
respective subjects because for reasons of privacy, we did
not use a camera at their residence. The subjects, rather than
volunteering, joined this experiment as a part-time job to
verify its correct function. If some readily apparent error was
identiﬁed in terms of not getting up after sleeping, we modiﬁed
the life record after conﬁrming that fact with subjects.
We conducted a monitoring experiment divided into 2
periods of one month each. The ﬁrst and second experimental
periods were, respectively, from October 27 through November
25 and from November 29 through December 28, 2017. The
respectively obtained datasets were deﬁned as Datasets 1 and
2. Herein, Dataset 2 contains data loss because of malfunctions
of the home agent and the server. Therefore, the data lengths
of one subject and other three subjects were, respectively, 18
days through December 16 and 27 days through December
25. For learning, we used datasets stored in the server with
ofﬂine signal processing without using the monitoring signals
obtained directly from the home agents and the ambient
sensors.
The recognition target patterns comprise three states: going
out (Out), staying at home (Home), and sleeping on the bed
(Sleep). In addition to these three patterns, our system can
recognize the opening or closing of a refrigerator door and
turning on or off a TV using a remote control from the life
records used for GT. By contrast, to maintain the privacy of
monitoring subjects, we set target patterns as the minimum
necessary for recognition.
The reports [35]-[37] addressed that it is useful to conﬁrm
survival at home using an electric kettle, a TV, a microwave
oven, and a refrigerator. We consider that unexpected accidents
are preventable if a state change between Home and Sleep
could be detected. Therefore, we set three states as the basic
life patterns, which were the minimum necessary combination
for the recognition of this monitoring experiment.
The time resolution was set to one minute intervals based
on the ﬁgure reported by Mori et al. [38] for the number
of sensor responses and the frequency of switching behavior
statuses. For this experiment, 43,200 sensor signals were
obtained as evaluation targets from each dataset of one month.
The model numbers of the four home agents, which trans-
mit monitoring signals to the server through a mobile router,
were M2001, M2002, M2003, and M2004. The discretized
sensor signals were displayed each day on a web page as color
bars. With consideration of privacy, the visualization range
is set to 15 hours from 6:00AM to 21:00PM. By contrast,
we used the whole 24 hours of signals for the evaluation
of identiﬁed life patterns with 10-fold cross validation. For
instance, signals of 27 days and 3 days in 30 days were,
respectively, divided into training and validation sets with
exchange 10 times.
B. Comparison of learning algorithms
Using Dataset 1, we conducted a comparison experiment
with learning algorithms. Table I presents comparison results
of mean accuracies of ten trials with cross validation. Recog-
nition accuracies except for those GNB and AB were approx-
imately 80%. In the remaining eight learning algorithms, the
recognition accuracy of GBDT was 83.72% as the highest
accuracy.
Table II depicts results of the processing time for the
respective algorithms. As computer hardware, this study used
a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i 5 CPU with 8 GB of 1600 MHz DDR

using a standard function on Python.
As depicted in Table II, the minimum execution time was
2.62 s for RF. The comparison result denotes that NG and
SGD have similar processing speeds. Herein, the processing
time of GBDT was 194.20 s, which was 86.93 times longer
than that of RF. By contrast, the difference of mean recognition
accuracies was merely 0.11%. We selected RF as an algorithm
for life pattern recognition for this study.

nary experiments.
Table III presents recognition accuracies for Dataset 1. The
recognition accuracies for 10 sets of the cross veriﬁcation are
shown as detailed results. The mean recognition accuracy of
the four subjects was 83.61%. Details reveal that the highest
and lowest recognition accuracies were, respectively, 91.95%
for M2001 and 72.50% for M2002. Herein, the recognition
accuracies of some subjects were extremely low, as revealed
in the details of cross validation results. For this experiment,
we evaluated the result as mean accuracy, not merely obtained
highest accuracy in the combination of the cross validation.
Herein, the low recognition accuracy of M2003 was cased from
GT as handwritten life records because the subject sometime
forgot to record it.
Table IV presents recognition accuracies for Dataset 2. For
this dataset, data deﬁcits were found from malfunctions related
to the home agent and the server. Because of the malfunction
of the home agent, the mean recognition accuracy for the 18-
day monitoring period was 92.53%. Compared with the result
on Dataset 1, the mean recognition accuracy improved 8.92%
with the effect of the shortened period. To alleviate trouble,
we changed M2004 to M2005, which was an alternative
home agent. However, the problem of sensor signal monitoring
continued. After terminating the receipt of data related to this
subject, we continued monitoring for three subjects from the
19th day. The mean recognition accuracy for the partial dataset
collected up to 27 days until the server trouble was 93.85%.
Although monitoring terms and subjects were insufﬁcient, the
former and latter results were, respectively, 8.92% and 10.24%
higher than that of Dataset 1.

CONCLUSION
This paper presented a novel life monitoring system con-
sisting of a home agent and ambient sensors. As a preliminary
experiment aimed at monitoring various life patterns of elderly
people, we conducted a monitoring experiment during two
months for four university students subjects in their 20s. We
developed a recognition method for three life patterns using
machine-learning algorithms. Experimentally obtained results
revealed that the mean recognition accuracy was 83.61% for
Dataset 1, which was obtained from the ﬁrst half of the
monitoring experiment during one month with one-minute
downsampled signal intervals. For the last half of the monitor-
ing experiment, data acquisition was interrupted because of a
malfunction of the home agent. We continued the evaluation
experiment of life patterns with delimiting two periods. The
recognition accuracies were 92.53% for 18 days and 93.85%
for 27 days in Dataset 2.
For our future work, we expect to consider stable operation
of the whole system and prompt responses to malfunctions,
if they should occur. Moreover, we would like to increase
the number of recognition targets for daily behavior patterns
while protecting privacy. Particularly, we would like to realize
a new emergency notiﬁcation function using a pillow sensor.
Furthermore, after the cooperation with single elderly people
for extending systemization and practical application, we hope
to conduct demonstration experiments.
