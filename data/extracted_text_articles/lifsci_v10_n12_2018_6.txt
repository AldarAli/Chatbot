Abstract- Executive function performance of older 
individuals is lower compared to young adults. We 
investigate whether N-Back working memory (WM) 
training improves both trained WM- and untrained 
cognitive function performance (transfer effects). As 
previous studies showed that electroencephalogram (EEG) 
responses, in particular Event Related Potentials (ERPs), 
vary with task difficulty level and age, we focused on the 
relation between ERPs-P300 and task difficulty level in 
young and older adults. We used two groups of healthy 
young and older participants to assess the effect of N-Back 
training: cognitive training group (CTG) and passive 
control group (PCG). CTG performed an N-Back task 
with 3 difficulty levels (1, 2, 3-Back), and PCG did not 
undergo 
any 
training. 
Pre- 
and 
post-tests 
were 
administered to both groups to gauge any transfer effects 
(spatial memory, attention and fluid intelligence). Our 
results show age-related differences in P300-ERPs, 
reaction time and accuracy for N-Back training task and 
in 
spatial 
memory 
and 
reasoning 
pre 
post-tests. 
Improvements in the trained task are stronger for CTG 
young than CTG older individuals. Furthermore, transfer 
effects to attention (TOVA) were found in both young and 
older adults for CTG, showing the benefits of the training.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 Cognitive training is a powerful tool to explore the 
plasticity of the aging brain to improve cognitive 
functions such as intelligence, episodic memory, 
working memory, and executive functions [1][2][3]. 
Morrison and Chein [4], in a review of working 
memory (WM) training, divided the training approaches  
 
in two categories: strategy training (domain specific 
strategies), and core training (repetition of demanding 
WM tasks). In our study, we adhered to the second 
approach, where the participants were exposed several 
times to a repetition of visual stimuli during a WM task.  
Working memory (WM), as defined by Baddeley 
[2], refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of 
information necessary to execute complex cognitive 
tasks. WM training was originally used to enhance WM 
in neuropsychiatric subjects with a WM deficit, such as 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [5] and 
several authors studied the mechanisms behind and the 
effect of WM training [6][7].  
The N-back task is a working memory task 
introduced by Wayne Kirchner in 1958 [8] as a visuo-
spatial task with four load factors (‘‘0-Back’’ to ‘‘3-
Back’’), and by Mackworth [9] as a visual letter task 
with up to six load factors. Gevins et al. [10] introduced 
it into neuroscience by using it as a ‘‘visuomotor 
memory task’’ with one load factor (3-Back). The N-
back task involves multiple processes and is considered 
a dual task: working memory updating, which involves 
the encoding of incoming stimuli, the monitoring, 
maintenance, and updating of the sequence, and 
stimulus matching (matching the current stimulus to the 
one that occurred N positions back in the sequence). It 
reflects a number of core Executive Functions (EFs) 
besides working memory, such as inhibitory control and 
cognitive flexibility, as well as other higher-order EFs, 
such as problem solving, decision making, selective 
attention, among other functions [11]. The N-Back task 
requires participants to maintain stimulus information 
necessary for successful task performance in working 
memory across multiple trials [11]. It has been shown

that the N-Back task consistently activates dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as well as parietal regions in 
the adult brain [12]. Schneiders et al. [13] have shown 
that, using N-Back training, it is possible to achieve an 
improvement in task performance and an alteration in 
brain activity, such as a decreased activation in the right 
superior middle frontal gyrus (BA 6) and posterior 
parietal regions (BA 40).  
     Following a series of studies, Jaeggi et al. [14][15] 
reported that by performing an N-Back task, the effects 
of WM training transfer to untrained tasks requiring 
WM (transfer effects) improve upon a complex human 
ability known as fluid intelligence. The findings of 
Jaeggi et al. [14] also support the hypothesis that 
transfer effects to general cognitive functions can be 
achieved after an N-Back training for tasks that 
conceptually overlap, albeit only slightly, with the N-
Back task. Training of the general fronto-parietal WM 
network should lead to improvements in cognitive 
functions that rely on the same network [10]. This 
general overlap hypothesis predicts that if training 
considerably engages the fronto-parietal WM network 
and the transfer task generates a similar activation 
pattern, an extensive training of this network will yield 
a general boosting of cognitive functions. An alternative 
hypothesis predicts that WM training effects transfer 
only if training improves specific cognitive processes 
required in both training and transfer tasks. Dahlin et al. 
[16] found transfer, after WM updating training, to an 
N-Back task that resembled the original trained task in 
also relying on updating processes, but not to a Stroop 
task that involved inhibition but no updating. 
Furthermore, Dahlin et al. [16] and Li et al. [2] reported 
that training on an N-Back task improves WM training 
for both young and older healthy subjects. Interestingly, 
Dahlin et al. [16] found larger improvements in young 
healthy subjects, whereas Li et al. [2] found comparable 
improvements in both groups. The reasons for this 
difference could be the frequency and duration of the 
training, and the overlap of the elements of a skill 
between the trained and the specific transfer task. 
Despite this difference, both studies demonstrate 
working memory plasticity in young and older adults, 
and the possibility to obtain near-transfer effects that are 
stable in time. So, although the degree of plasticity 
varies across studies, the potential of the brain to 
reorganize in response to demands is found in people of 
all ages [17][18][19]. 
 
The aim of our study was to verify whether N-Back 
task performance improves after N-Back training, and 
whether transfer effects to other (untrained) cognitive 
functions are obtained, such as in spatial memory, 
attention and reasoning, in two different groups of 
healthy young and older subjects: cognitive training 
group (CTG) and passive control group (PCG). We 
recorded EEG responses during all training sessions, 
and focused on the P300, an ERP component related to 
working memory [20]. 
 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
describe the material and methods (subjects, procedure, 
EEG recording). In Section III, we focus on the 
behavioral and P300-ERPs results using WM training 
and the transfer effects pre- and post-training in young 
and older adults. Finally, in Section IV, we discuss our 
results and propose a number of technical and 
conceptual goals for future studies. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In this section, we describe the participant 
recruitment, training procedure and EEG recording. 
A. Subjects 
We recruited 17 healthy young subjects (9 females, 
8 males, mean age 29 years, range 24-34 years), 
undergraduate or graduate students from KU Leuven, 
and 19 healthy older subjects (13 females, 6 males, 
mean age 62.25 years old, range between 50-69 years 
old) via posters, social media, and KU Leuven’s 
Academic Center for General Practice. Participants 
were healthy, with normal or corrected vision, without 
any history of psychiatric or neurological diseases, not 
on any medication, and never participated in working 
memory training. 
 
B. Cognitive training  
 Participants were assigned to two sub-groups, 
cognitive training group (N=9, young; N=10, older) and 
passive control group (N=8, young; N=9, older), to 
evaluate improvements in task performance after WM 
training and to record any transfer effects to other 
cognitive tasks (see further for their definition). During 
all training sessions, EEG was recorded (see also 
further). For the cognitive training group, all subjects 
(i.e., young and older ones) performed WM training 
with visual feedback of the correctness of their 
behavioral responses and received a monetary reward 
(with a maximum of 10 € if all responses were correct). 
The control group did not undergo any training.  
 
C. Transfer effects  
A battery of cognitive tests were administered 
before and after training (pre and post-tests, note that 
for the control group there was no training between 
tests) to see if there were transfer effects to attention, 
spatial memory, reasoning, and intelligence. The study 
was approved by our university’s ethical committee and 
when subjects agreed to participate in the experiment 
they signed the informed consent form prior approved 
by the said committee.

D. Procedure  
Subjects participated in an N-back task in which a 
sequence of stimuli was shown and the task was to 
decide whether the current stimulus matched one shown 
N items earlier (Figure 2).  
 
The stimuli were presented for 1000ms followed by 
a 2000ms Inter-stimulus interval (ISI), jittered by ± 100 
ms, during which the picture was replaced by a fixation 
cross. This is the moment when participants needed to 
press a button when the stimulus was a target. We had 
33% of our pictures as targets.  
Sequences with identical difficulty levels (1-back, 2-
back, 3-back) were grouped into 2 min. blocks across 
four sessions. Each session included two repetitions of 3 
sequences. In total there were 8 blocks. For each 
sequence, 
there 
were 
60 
stimuli 
presented 
in 
pseudorandom order. Before starting with the first three 
sequences, a training session consisting of ten stimuli 
for each difficulty level was used to explain the N-Back 
task. Subjects performed an N-Back training during 10 
sessions, 3 times per week (30 minutes each time), as 
shown in Figure 1. This is in line with literature reports 
on significant training and transfer effects obtained after 
3 weeks of training [14][21-24]. 
 
 
 
 
All participants were administered a battery of pre- 
and post-tests to evaluate whether there were transfer 
effects to other cognitive functions. We used Test of 
Variables of Attention (TOVA) [25], Spatial Working 
Memory Test (CORSI) [26] and RAVEN, a fluid 
intelligence test [27]. The behavioral pre- and post-tests 
were administered to compare task performance 
between groups (cognitive training, active control and 
passive control groups) in the trained (N-Back task) and 
untrained tasks (TOVA, CORSI and RAVEN test). 
N-back task and transfer tasks had similarities and 
differences [14][27][28]. The spatial memory task 
(Corsi test) engaged WM updating processes just as the 
N-Back task, but differed in stimuli (squares in Corsi 
task vs. pictures in the N-Back task) and task rules 
(recognition of previously presented items in the N-
Back tasks vs. recollection of items in the updating 
transfer tasks). Given these similarities and differences, 
we are using near transfer tasks according to Karbach 
and Kray [29]. 
 
In the first experimental session (pre-test), each 
participant was informed about the experimental 
procedure and invited to sign the informed consent 
form. The day after the first meeting, the participants 
performed the behavioral pre-test session, and from the 
third meeting, the training groups (CTG) started the 
training procedure of CTG. At the beginning of each 
training session, an EOG calibration session was 
performed to model eye movements and blinks using 
the AAA method described in Croft and Barry [30]. 
 
E. EEG recording  
      EEG was recorded continuously from 32 Ag/AgCl 
electrodes at a sampling rate of 2 kHz using a 
SynampsRT 
device 
(Neuroscan, 
Australia). 
The 
electrodes were placed at O1,Oz, O2, PO3, PO4, P8, P4, 
Pz, P3, P7, TP9, CP5, CP1, CP2, CP6, TP10, T7, C3, 
Cz, C4, T8, FC6, FC2, FC1, FC5, F3, Fz, F4, AF3, 
AF4, Fp1, Fp2. The reference was placed at AFz and 
the ground at CPz. Additionally, four electrodes were 
placed around the eyes, on the upper and lower side of

the left eye (vertical) and near the external canthus of 
each eye (horizontal), for electro-oculogram recording 
(EOG, bi-polar recording).  
 
      The recorded EEG signal was re-referenced offline 
from the original reference to the average of two 
mastoid electrodes (TP9 and TP10), corrected for eye 
movement and blinking artifacts [30], band-pass filtered 
in the range of 0.1–30 Hz, and cut into epochs starting 
200 ms pre- till 1000 ms post- stimulus onset. Baseline 
correction is performed by subtracting the average of 
the 200 ms pre-stimulus onset activity from the 1000 ms 
post-stimulus onset activity. Finally, the epochs are 
downsampled to 100 Hz and stored for ERP detection.  
     Recorded epochs with incorrect button press 
responses were excluded from further analysis.  In 
addition, epochs with EEG signals greater than 100mV 
were also excluded. A two-way ANOVA (factors: n-
back X target) was performed on all sampled EEG time 
points between 250 ms to 400 ms. Bonferroni correction 
for multiple comparisons was used across all samples 
within this time window.    
III. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we describe working memory 
training (behavioral and ERPs results) and transfer 
effects. 
 
A. Working memory training (behavioral)  
     We also analyzed changes due to cognitive training 
by examining behavioral data (accuracy, reaction time 
(RT)) of CTG during N-Back training (10 sessions) of 
healthy young and older subjects (Figures 4 and 5). The 
purpose is to test our second hypothesis: training can 
improve related cognitive function performance, and 
transfer to other cognitive functions as shown by 
significant effects in RT and response accuracy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the CTG-young, we observed a reduction in RT 
as function of training sessions. To test this, we 
performed a three-way ANOVA across factors (N-back 
level, subject and session). We found a significant effect 
of session (F(9)=4.9, p<0.001) confirming that RT 
indeed decreases with more training. Importantly, the 
N-Back level x session interaction was significant 
(F(18)=3.01, p<0.001), which indicates that the N-back 
levels  are differentially affected by training. In contrast, 
when we looked at accuracy, the  main effect of session 
was not significant (p=0.56) indicating that accuracy did 
not substantially increase as a result of training although 
there was a main effect of N-back level confirming that 
task difficulty affected performance (F(2)=7.97, p<0.05). 
For the CTG-older, we also performed a three-way 
ANOVA across factors (N-back level, subject and 
session). We found for RT a significant effect of N-back 
level (F(2)=37.62, p<0.05) indicating that task difficulty 
affects reaction time. For the accuracy we found 
significant effects for N-Back level (F(2)=119.58, 
p<0.001) and session (F(9)=3.77, p<0.05). Importantly, 
the N-Back level x session interaction was significant 
(F(18)=2.09, p<0.05) indicating that accuracy improves 
with training and the gained improvements differ with 
N-Back level.                                                                
 
B. Working memory training (ERPs results) 
Neuroimaging studies have shown that during N-
Back task performance the most activated brain regions 
are the lateral premotor cortex, dorsal cingulate and 
medial premotor cortex, dorsolateral and ventrolateral 
prefrontal cortex, frontal poles, and medial and lateral 
posterior parietal cortex [10]. In addition, since several 
EEG studies showed that the midline electrodes are the 
most significant ones [31][32], we decided to analyze 
ERPs using electrodes Fz, Pz, and Cz. Data from mean 
P300 peak amplitude is presented in Figures 6 and 7 in 
three different moments (3 sessions/each moment) 
during training (first-, middle- and last sessions) for 
young and older adults.

P300 peak amplitude data from midline electrodes 
(Fz, Cz, Pz) were analyzed with a three-way ANOVA 
(N-Back level x target x session). P300 peak amplitude 
(target minus no-target) was higher for the N-Back 
levels that were easier (1 and 2-Back), and was lower 
for the more difficult one (3-Back), especially for 
healthy older subjects. P300 peak amplitude (difference 
between target and no-target) was largest for the frontal 
electrode (Fz) and decreased for the central (Cz) and 
posterior electrodes (Pz).  
Significant differences were found in healthy young 
subjects for CTG (Figure 6) between first (1st) and last 
(10th) training session for 3-Back task in channel Fz 
(F(1)=6.4155, p<0.05) and in channel Cz (F(1)=3.9479, 
p<0.05), and between first and middle session (5th 
session) for 3-Back task in channel Fz (F(1)=7.2620, 
p<0.01), in channel Cz (F(1)=6.0811, p<0.05), and in 
channel Pz (F(1)=5.4272, p<0.05).  
     Furthermore, statistically, P300 amplitude between 
the 1st and last session (10th) showed higher amplitude 
for 3-Back task compared to the other N-Back difficulty 
levels (1 and 2-Back), indicating that young adults 
improved more for the most difficult task (3-Back). The 
P300 amplitude was largest for the frontal electrode 
(Fz) and decreased for the central (Cz) and posterior 
electrodes (Pz) in young adults for the difference 
between 1st and 10th session (Figure 6, right). We 
compared also 1st and middle (5th) session where we 
could already seen significant improvement for the most 
difficult task (3-Back), showing that 5 training sessions 
of N-Back training for healthy young adults could be 
sufficient to have significant improvement in the trained 
task. Taken together, these data support the observation 
that the P300 amplitude increase with training sessions, 
and that also for the 3-Back task, although the most 
difficult one, WM training was effective.  
 
As to the healthy old subjects of CTG (CTG-old): 
we also analyzed the P300 amplitudes of the midline 
electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz) with a three-way ANOVA (N-
Back level x target x session) for CTG-old. We found 
significant differences between the first and the last 
session for 3-Back task in channel Pz (F(1)=6.2091, 
p<0.05), showing that 3-Back task became easier for the 
participants. Furthermore, similar to the previous results 
for healthy young subjects, P300 amplitude in the first 
session was higher for the N-Back difficulty levels that 
were easier (1 and 2-Back), and lower for the more 
difficult one (3-Back). Also in this case, P300 amplitude 
(difference between target and non-target) was larger 
for the frontal electrode (Fz) than for the central (Cz) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and posterior electrodes (Pz). After the training with 
older adults, the P300 became higher for the most 
difficult task (3-Back) in parietal region, showing that 
WM training can modify the amplitude (Figure 7). 
These findings confirm the results of Gevins et al. [35] 
who reported that training on an N-Back shows EEG 
changes in responses to changes in the mental effort 
required for task performance. We compared also 1st 
and middle (5th) session, but in contrast to young 
healthy adults, we did not find any significant 
improvement for the most difficult task (3-Back), 
showing that for healthy older subjects are necessary 10 
training sessions of N-Back training. These data support 
the observation that the P300 amplitude increase with 
training sessions, and that also for the 3-Back task, 
although the most difficult one, WM training was 
effective. 
 
     Salminen et al. [36] showed after N-back training 
benefits for both young and older subjects in terms of 
behavioral response accuracies, with differences in 
improvement between young and older adults. Also 
Friedman, and Simpson [33] found changes in ERP 
amplitudes of young and older adults during oddball 
task performance. Given these observations, we looked 
for differences in P300 components of young and older 
healthy subjects. Our results showed significant effects 
for the interaction between age differences and target 
minus non-target for 2-Back task in channel Fz 
(F(1)=13.3309, p<0.001), in channel Cz (F(1)= 6.4395, 
p<0.05), and in channel Pz (F(1)=9.6903, p<0.01).   
 
C. Transfer effects (Pre- and Post-tests) 
     Means for each task are presented in Table I for the 
pre- and post-tests between young and older subjects. In 
Figures 8 and 9, a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) 
was conducted on intra and inter-groups (CTG and PCG 
young and older) and between sessions (pre- and post-
tests). For young subjects, significant effects for 
accuracy in N-Back task between CTG and PCG 
(F(1)=6.21, p<0.05), for pre- and post-testing, were 
observed. No significant differences in the other 
cognitive tests (CORSI and RAVEN) were found. For 
the N-Back task, significant effects were found for RT 
between CTG and PCG, for pre- and post-tests 
(F(1)=40.9, p<0.001), for task difficulty level (F(2)=4.92, 
p<0.05), for group x pre- and post-test interaction 
(F(1)=9.14, p<0.05), and for pre- and post-test x N-Back 
level interaction (F(2)=3.54, p<0.05).

between CTG and PCG (F(1)=30.88, p<0.001) for 
group. No significant differences in CORSI and 
RAVEN accuracies were found between groups. 
Significant effects were found for RT between CTG

Since Dahlin et al. [34] showed that younger adults 
gain more benefits from cognitive training than older 
adults, but Bherer, Westerberg, and Bäckman [36] 
showed the opposite (older subjects gained more 
positive effects than younger ones), we analyzed the 
differences between young and older adults. We used 
a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) for the factors 
group (young and older) in the CTG, and session 
(pretest and post-test, Figures 10 and 11). Significant 
effects for accuracy in CORSI test (F(1)=6.18, p<0.05) 
for group, as well for RAVEN (F(1)=24.97, p<0.001) 
for group, and in training (F(1)=5.7, p<0.05). No 
significant differences in the N-Back and TOVA 
results between groups were found. For the N-Back 
task (Figure 13), significant effects were found for RT 
between CTG young and older for group (F(1)= 27.98,

In summary, with our pre- and post-training tests on 
other untrained cognitive functions, we wanted to verify 
whether any transfer effects could be obtained after N-
Back training. Our results indicate clear improvements in 
attention, which is in line with the outcomes of Dahlin et 
al. [34] who showed larger improvements for younger 
adults than for older ones.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
We investigated whether cognitive training using an N-
Back task only improves performance in this task or 
transfers to other tasks. To assess this, we performed 10 N-
Back training sessions in one group (CTG) of young and 
older adults, and assessed their cognitive performance with 
a battery of cognitive tasks (TOVA, CORSI and RAVEN 
test) before and after training. During training, CTG 
participants performed the 1,2,3-Back task. Furthermore, a 
second group of participants (PCG) for young and older 
adults performed no training but was subjected to the same 
battery of cognitive tests. We found for healthy young 
subjects that training indeed improves performance of the 
CTG group compared to the PCG group. Therefore, there is 
a clear improvement for CTG on the task they were trained 
on (N-Back task). In contrast, the transfer of training effects 
into other tasks is more nuanced: the transfer was significant 
for the attention (TOVA) test, but only for CTG, but there 
was a trend for spatial memory (CORSI) and fluid 
intelligence (RAVEN) tests that was larger for CTG than for 
PCG. These results are in line with the conclusions of 
Jaeggi et al. [14] who showed that, when using a working 
memory task, not only working memory improves but also 
fluid intelligence. However, the results are not in line with 
those of Dahlin et al. [34] who found that, whereas working 
memory training improves performance of a related working 
memory task, other cognitive functions did not improve.  
For healthy older adults, we found a significant 
improvement in N-Back task performance for CTG 
compared to PCG, and in TOVA task performance for CTG 
compared to PCG, and a trend of improvement in CTG for 
the CORSI and RAVEN tests compared to PCG. These 
results are in line with the studies of Yang et al. [37] and 
Dahlin et al. [34] who showed that the capacity of plasticity 
in the ageing brain improves cognitive functioning. One 
explanation for transfer effects being significant only for the 
attention task (TOVA), and not for the spatial memory 
(CORSI) and fluid intelligence tasks (RAVEN), for both 
groups (young and older), maybe due to our small sample 
size. 
Furthermore, we wanted to compare the effect of 
cognitive training in young and older subjects in CTG and 
PCG, and P300 ERP amplitude during N-Back task 
performance in CTG, for both groups. The results of CTG 
showed that cognitive training improves performance of the 
N-Back task in RT, and that the transfer effects were 
significant for the RAVEN and CORSI tests, but not for 
TOVA, which is in line with the Jaeggi et al. [14] results. 
Although both young and older healthy subjects improved 
their performance after WM training, younger healthy 
subjects showed a larger effect following cognitive training 
compared to older healthy subjects, which is in line with the 
results of Brehmer et al. [20] and Dahlin et al. [34]. We 
observed significant differences in P300 amplitude between 
young and older subjects for N-Back level of the task, target 
stimuli and sessions (first vs last, first vs middle) in 3-Back 
task, indicating that 5 training sessions could be enough to 
improve the trained WM task. In this way, we 
complemented the study of Friedman et al. [33] who used a 
simple oddball paradigm to observe the differences of ERP 
amplitude in young and older adults, showing the number of 
training sessions that could be necessary to improve the N-
Back task.  
 
An issue that deserves consideration is why N-Back 
training in our study did not produce transfer effects in 
CORSI test (spatial memory), while in Dahlin et al. [34] 
study they observed transfer effects to another memory task 
(near-transfer effects). Furthermore, as the EEG results from 
our study suggest a change in the ERPs-P300 during 
cognitive training, our future study will consider not only 
behavioral data (accuracy and RT) but also P300-ERPs to 
change in real time the difficulty level of the task, in order 
to avoid fatigue or boredom for the subject. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
As cognitive training is becoming important during 
one’s life-span, to maintain cognitive plasticity and 
postpone cognitive decline, we decided to study the power 
of this tool in search of the benefits that can be gained by 
young and older adults. We showed that N-Back training 
not only improves WM but also transfers to another 
cognitive function (i.e., attention). The results provide 
evidence that it is indeed possible to improve the trained 
task (working memory), but also transfer to other cognitive 
tasks. Furthermore, our findings are promising to be used 
with a larger cohort of healthy older subjects and patients 
with cognitive decline.
