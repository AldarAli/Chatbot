Abstract—Although
Machine-to-Machine
(M2M)
communication has advantages of high flexibility and the
ability of network communication, once the number of devices
increases, collision occurance rises, and thus causes efficiency
degradation of the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and
consumes more power for data transmission. To resolve the
problems M2M devices confront in a WiFi wireless network,
this paper modified the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with
Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism of IEEE 802.11
to propose a media access mechanism called CSMA/CA-RBT.
CSMA/CA-RBT
is
an
improved
media
access
control
mechanism that is compatible with the traditional CSMA/CA
mechanism. Using CSMA/CA-RBT, the occurrence of collision
can thus be reduced. In addition, to improve the performance
of CSMA/CA, CSMA/CA-RBT can also add the power–saving
improvement mechanism to tackle the power-saving issue. The
performance analysis results showed that, when the number of
mobile nodes increases, the transmission performance and the
energy efficiency can be greatly improved using the proposed
CSMA/CA-RBT scheme.

INTRODUCTION
Machine-to-Machine
(M2M)
communication
is
a
machine-independent
communication
approach
without
needing human intervention during the communication. It is
integrated with sensors, micro and low-priced processing
units, and equipped with wireless communication capability.
Thus, some machines can form Internet of Things (IoT) [1]
using independent communication mechanisms over the
Internet.
Through
the
connection
of
Wireless
Sensor
Networks (WSNs), M2Ms can collect data using the sensors
on the devices and respond to the collected data accordingly
to monitor objects or circumstances [2]. Typical M2M
applications include interconnected devices and backbone
network transmitting two-way data between devices and
applications [3].
Although M2M communication has advantages of high
flexibility and the ability of network communication, once
the number of devices increases, the increased data would
have considerable impact on the network. On the other
hand, the 802.11 random backoff procedure that is used
during the transmission would further cause a delay in data
transmission. Once nodes have a frequent occurrence of
collisions and repeatedly conduct the random backoff
procedure, the increased delay causes efficiency degradation
in the MAC layer. Thus, a new access method that can
reduce the occurrence of the possibility of collision and
increases the performance is urgently required.
To reduce the occurrence of collision and avoid energy
waste, this paper devises a modified media access control
mechanism of IEEE 802.11 protocol to improve the
transmission efficiency. In our proposed method, each
mobile node randomly selects the next time slot t, which is
called Registered Backoff Time (RBT), that it wants to
transmit its next packet and indicates RBT t in the currently
transmitted data packet Pt. When an Access Point (AP)
receives data packet PT, AP extracts and stores RBT t and
the corresponding mobile node’s identification (ID) in its
record. AP checks its RBT record and indicates the next
time slot t and the corresponding mobile node’s ID MT,
which denotes when the channel can be used and which
mobile node can transmit its data packet in the nearest
future, in the acknowledgement (ACK) packet PA for
acknowledging data packet PT.
Since the ACK packet PA is transmitted in a broadcast
way, all mobile nodes in AP’s signal coverage can receive
it. After receiving the ACK packet PA, the mobile node MT
can understand that it can transmit its next data packet t time
slots later and the other mobile nodes can know the channel
will be busy and which mobile node gets the next channel
access privilege. At the same time, those mobile nodes
whose selected time slots for transmitting their data packets
are also t time slots later but are not scheduled as the one
that can have the channel access right, would randomly
select the other time slots for their next data packet’s
transmission. Using the piggyback concept, the collision’s
situation can be improved. Additionally, since all mobile
nodes can know the next time slot, e.g., t time slots later in
the aforementioned example, all mobile nodes can switch to
the sleep mode from the current time until t time slots later.
It can thus reach the goal of saving power.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as
follows. Section II introduces the related work. Section III
presents the analysis of power consumption. Section IV

RELATED WORK
In past years, the research on power-saving was
mainly based on improving the power-saving mode (PSM)
[4]. The common approaches are adding a scheduling
mechanism to PSM, which allows AP to schedule the data
to be transmitted and adjust power-saving states of mobile
nodes (MNs) according to the scheduling. The authors in [5]
proposed an implementation allowing station (STA) to
dynamically adjust active time in which AP would be able
to predict the next optimal beacon time for STA, enabling
STA to be active and conducting transmission after the
beacon time.
IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)
utilize the CSMA/CA mechanism to conduct media access
control, which makes mobile nodes except the sender-
receiver pair consume a lot of energy to receive unnecessary
packets and thus causes energy waste. The authors in [6]
therefore proposed a Bi-Directional Sleep DCF (BDSL-
DCF) to (1) improve the energy efficiency of DCF, (2)
prolong the lifetime of the mobile node in wireless network,
(3)
utilize
bi-directional
communications
to
enhance
throughput and (4) prolong transmission time.
Similarly, for resource competition, the authors in [7]
proposed to improve the selection process of contention
window
(CW)
using
a
method
named
New
Binary
Exponential Backoff (N-BEB), which can achieve fairness
and efficiency and reduce the packet lost rate. To adjust
CW, the work in [8] proposed an algorithm that enables
every mobile node to dynamically adjust the CW size
according to channel congestion and thus can reduce the
occurrence of collision and obtain better performance
accordingly.
III.
ANALYSIS OF POWER CONSUMPTION
During the operation of a mobile node, weather it is at
transmission, reception,
idle mode or sleep
mode,
it
consumes power. Beside, when a collision occurs, it would
cause the network system an additional burden. Hence, to
understand the influence of collision on the overall network
operation, we use the CSMA/CA access to explain how the
design of the MAC protocol influences power consumption.
Referring to Fig. 1, it is assumed that MN1 and MN2
have 2 and 3 packets to be transmitted, respectively, and the
initialized binary exponential backoff (BEB) time are 8 and
12 slots respectively. Since the BEB time of MN1 is shorter,
after waiting for 8 slots, MN1 would acquire the right for
channel access MN would reselect a random time slot from
the contention window after receiving the ACK packet.
Thus, the example depicted in Fig. 1 follows the sequence
of MN2→MN2→MN1→MN2 thereafter to obtain the right 
for channel access. In Fig. 1(b), collision occurs when MN1
is transmitting the 2nd data packet and MN2 is transmitting
the 3rd data packet, which leads to the execution of the
random backoff procedure and thus the transmission time is
re-selected.

avoided in advance, the power consumption is expected to

IV.
THE PROPOSED CSMA/CA-RBT SCHEME
In the proposed CSMA/CA-RBT method, the mobile
node would attach a random number in the packet when the
mobile node transmits data to AP. This random number is
called Registered Backoff Time (RBT). When an AP
receives the data packet, it would add the RBT to AP side’s
RBT
list,
which
is
called
Registered-Time-Slot-List
(RTSL), to conduct the scheduling. When replying the ACK
packet, it would add prescheduling information, e.g., MAC
address of the next transmitter’s node and the estimated
transmission slot time of the follow-up time period, in the
ACK packet. Since the ACK packet is transmitted using
broadcast, all of the mobile nodes that are in the signal
coverage of the AP can receive the ACK packet transmitted
by the AP. This way, all of the covered mobile nodes can
get the prescheduling information for the follow-up time
period of the network channel and thus can adjust their
backoff timers to reduce the occurrence of collision.
In the proposed scheme, when the backoff timer counts
down to 0, the mobile node would select one random
number to be the RBT for its next data transmission and put
the RBT to the data packet. The ACK packet sent from AP
has a similar effect as the CTS packet. Mobile nodes can
obtain information related to RBT from the ACK packet and
acknowledge which mobile node, including AP, would
conduct the transmission after some slot times. Let x be the
slot time after the current time when a mobile node conducts
the next transmission. At this moment, all mobile nodes can
temporarily switch from the idle mode to the sleep mode
during the x slot times.
In contrast, when an AP receives the data packet, it
would take out the RBT i of the mobile node and match it
with the record in RTSL to determine whether the slot
denoted by RBT i is occupied or not. If RTSL[i] = 0, it
represents that slot i is not reserved before and AP can add
RBT i to RTSL by means of setting RTSL[RBT] = 1. After
updating RTSL, AP can understand which slot time is
registered
by
which
mobile
node
according
to
the
scheduling record in RTSL. AP sends the ACK packet
which
contains
the
information
of
the
following
transmission about registered time slot and node ID to the
mobile node. On the contrary, if RTSL[i] = 1, it represents
that slot i has been registered. RTSL remains unchanged,
and thus AP sends ACK packet according to RTSL directly.
The proposed scheme allows AP to coordinate using
RBT messages and thus some collisions can be avoided. As
mentioned in Section III, MN1 and MN2 have two and three
packets to be transmitted, respectively. Fig. 1 depicts the
execution flow using CSMA/CA. Fig. 2
depicts the
execution
flow
using
the
proposed
CSMA/CA-RBT
scheme. In this example, we highlighted the improvement of
the collision’s situation of the proposed CSMA/CA-RBT
only. However, the power saving mechanism in CSMA/CA-
RBT would be discussed in detail in Section V.
Referring to Fig. 2, the backoff time in the beginning is
8 and 12 slots for MN1 and MN2, respectively. Since the
backoff time of MN1 is shorter, MN1 would select a
random number as RBT after waiting for 8 slots and then
send the data packet with the selected RBT, which is 20 in
Fig. 2(a). After MN1 has successfully completed packet
transmission (DATA+RBT) and passes 4 slot times, MN2
would send its first data packet with the selected RBT,
which is 10 in Fig. 2(a). Then, according to the schedule,
MN2 would transmit its data packet after waiting for 10
time slots. MN2 selects RBT=6 when it transmits its 2nd data
packet. After receiving MN2’s 2nd packet, which indicates
its RBT is 6 time slots, AP knows that both MN1 and MN2
79

plan to transmit packets after 6 time slots. In the proposed
CSMA/CA-RBT Scheme, AP adopts the first-come-first-
served principle and thus selects MN1 as the mobile node to
have the next channel access right.
As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), after MN2 has transmitted its
2nd data packet, AP sends ACK to notify MN1 to transmit
its packet after 6 slot times. Since the ACK is transmitted in
a broadcast way, MN2 can also receive the ACK and thus
can find that it would collide with MN1’s data transmission.
Therefore, MN2 would modify its backoff time to avoid
collision after receiving the ACK. In the example depicted
in Fig. 2(a), MN2 modified its RBT to 36. Fig. 2(b) depicts
the execution flow after MN2’s RBT modification.

According to the results of (8) and (9), MN1 and MN2

aforementioned analysis results, we can understand that the
proposed CSMA/CA-RBT has better execution performance
and
better
power-saving
efficiency
than
the
original
standard CSMA/CA.
V.
THE POWER SAVING MECHANISM IN CSMA/CA-RBT
Owing to the AP has notified the next transmission
time slot, the mobile node can enter into sleep mode to save
power consumption before this registered time slot is due.
To increase power-saving in mobile nodes, the proposed
CSMA/CA-RBT
scheme
enables
a
power-saving
mechanism which lets all mobile nodes sleep before the
estimated transmission time. This can assure that there is a
complete sleep time period for mobile node.
The example depicted in Fig. 3, in which mobile
nodes A, B, C and D have requested for prescheduling
toward AP in advance (mobile nodes send RBT to AP), and
in between, A sends data to B. Owing to the infrastructure
network between A and B, A sending data to B is internal
data exchanging, packets are sent to AP (slot 2) from A and
then forwarded to B (un-scheduled) from AP. For mobile
nodes, except for a few registered slots, most slots belong to
idle slots.
Referring to Fig. 4(a), after passing 2 slots, A acquires
the right for channel access and sends its RBT to AP. To
assure the completion of communication between A and AP
and the mobile node has sufficient time to update RBT
information,
AP
would
arrange
to
transmit
A’s
data
transmitted to B based on the next known prescheduled slot,
i.e., the next slot after the slot reserved by mobile node C,
which is the 13th slot in Fig. 4(b). From Fig. 4(b), we can
observe that there are 12 idle slots between slot 0 and slot 13.
Thus, mobile nodes can switch to the sleep mode during this
period to save power. On the other hand, owing to switching
between the idle mode and the sleep mode takes the time of
1 idle slot, although there is 1 idle slot between slot 1 and
slot 3 in Fig. 4(c), mobile nodes would not switch to the
sleep mode in time slot 2 of Fig. 4(c). There are more than
80

one idle slot between slot 3 and slot 7 in Fig. 4(c), mobile
nodes can switch into the sleep mode between slot 3 and slot
7, depending on the implementation’s convenience to save
energy.

after mobile node A transmitting its data packet.
Compared to the idle mode, a mobile node consumes
relatively little power in the sleep mode. Theoretically, if we
can let the mobile node immediately enter into sleep mode
once it is idle, it can be very helpful to save power. Taking
Fig. 4 as an example, when mobile nodes are idle and wait
for transmitting/receiving packets, they can automatically
enter into sleep mode. The power consumption can be
calculated as follows:

According to the calculation result of (10), comparing with

the

Equations (11) and (12) show the total power consumption
of a mobile node in the idle and sleep modes, respectively.
Although the power consumption in the idle mode is not
much, however, 80% energy can be saved when a mobile
node is switched from idle mode to sleep mode based on
(10). Referring to the example depicted in Fig. 4, mobile
nodes A, B, C and D can save considerable power when
there are 15 time slots that allow them to switch from idle
mode to sleep mode.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The
performance
of
the
proposed
CSMA/CA-RBT
scheme was evaluated by performing a series of simulations
on the WiFi simulator using the IEEE 802.11 infrastructure-
based network model, for which Table I summarizes
parameter values used in the simulations.
Fig. 5 depicts the variations of the average network
throughput vs. the number of mobile nodes. Referring to Fig.
5, it is observed that when there are not many nodes within
the network, e.g., there are only 5 to 10 mobile nodes, owing
to CSMA/CA-RBT can reduce the occurrence of collision
and mobile node can complete the data transmission earlier,
CSMA/CA-RBT has higher throughput comparing with the
traditional CSMA/CA. In contrast, when there are a lot of
mobile nodes, e.g., 50 mobile nodes, CSMA/CA-RBT can
enhance
1-(0.0698/1.0570)=33.96%
of
the
throughput
comparing with the traditional CSMA/CA. In view of this, it
is known that CSMA/CA-RBT is beneficial to enhance
network performance in terms of throughput.

The throughput vs. the number of mobile nodes.
Fig. 6 shows the delay time for transmitting a fixed
amount of packets vs. the number of mobile nodes. Referring
to Fig. 6, when compared to CSMA/CA, CSMA/CA-RBT
has less delay time than that of the traditional CSMA/CA
because CSMA/CA-RBT can reduce the occurrence of
collisions and avoiding using larger contention window
when there is random backoff, which is especially true when
the number of mobile nodes is increased. When there are 50
mobile
nodes,
CSMA/CA-RBT
can
reduce
1-
(0.0199/0.0268)=25.75% of the delay time. The simulation
results depicted in Fig. 6 show that CSMA/CA-RBT always
has better performance in terms of delay time when the
number of mobile nodes is increased.

Fig. 7 depicts the power consumption of CSMA/CA-
RBT and CSMA/CA vs. the number of mobile nodes. To
analyze the result clearly, we classify the CSMA/CA-RBT
into two types: the one that lets mobile nodes switch from
idle mode into sleep mode is called CSMA/CA-RBT
(PSM); the other one that does not let mobile nodes switch
from idle mode into sleep mode, e.g., the example depicted
Fig. 2, is called CSMA/CA-RBT (idle).
Figure 7.
The power consumption vs. the number of mobile nodes.
The simulation results depicted in Fig. 7 show that,
with
the
increased
number
of
mobile
nodes,
the
transmission efficiency degrades because the competition
for the right of channel access gets worse, which also causes
the power consumption to increase. The power consumption
of using CSMA/CA (PSM) is lower than that of CSMA/CA.
Since (1) both of the CSMA/CA-RBT types can reduce the
power consumption of retransmission from the collision and
(2) CSMA/CA-RBT (PSM) allows mobile nodes to switch
the operation mode from idle mode to sleep mode,
CSMA/CA-RBT (PSM) can more effectively reduce power
consumption than CSMA/CA-RBT (idle).
It can be seen from the simulation results that
CSMA/CA-RBT can effectively reduce the occurrence of
collisions and thus can enhance throughput, alleviate the
delay, and avoid unnecessary power consumption. The
results also show that the more mobile the nodes are, the
better performance CSMA/CA-RBT can achieve.
VII.
CONCLUSION
The proposed CSMA/CA-RBT simply requires to modify
the media access mechanism of the MAC layer, and
meanwhile is compatible with the downward legacy IEEE
802.11 protocols. In comparison to the original IEEE 802.11
MAC mechanism, the proposed CSMA/CA-RBT scheme
can reduce collision and delay, enhancing the performance of
M2M communication over wireless network. The simulation
results showed that when the number of mobile nodes
increases, the proposed CSMA/CA-RBT scheme can not
only significantly improve the system performance, but also
save considerable power for the overall network.
