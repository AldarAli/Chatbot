Abstract—Sensor networks as a special subtype of wireless 
networks consist of a set of wirelessly connected sensor nodes. 
As sensor nodes have their own power sources, the network 
must be energy efficient, i.e., it is necessary to achieve minimal 
energy consumption. Therefore, energy efficiency of wireless 
sensor networks used for monitoring of environmental 
parameters is extremely important in remote networking 
scenarios. In this paper, an analysis of the energy consumption 
of sensor nodes in Long Range (LoRa) based wireless sensor 
networks, which are used in agriculture to observe 
environmental 
parameters, 
is 
performed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Sensor networks as a special subtype of wireless 
networks consist of a set of wirelessly connected sensor 
nodes. The connected sensor nodes form networks used for 
gathering and exchanging information, and for forwarding 
data via gateways to public or private servers [1]. Data is 
then collected on storage servers for easier access and data 
processing [2].  
Considering the fact that the sensor nodes can be 
equipped with different types of sensors, the field of 
application of wireless sensor networks is very wide. One of 
many possible areas of application of wireless sensor 
networks under Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm includes 
their 
application 
in 
agriculture 
and 
monitoring 
of 
environmental parameters [3-8]. In this case, the test 
environment consists of agricultural crops for which 
environmental and other parameters important for yield 
prediction are observed under different conditions. Wireless 
systems based on usage of sensor nodes make agricultural 
processes more intelligent, since they become more precise, 
data-oriented and highly automated [9]. 
The source of energy required for the operation of the 
sensor node is mainly a battery, which is sometimes 
connected to an additional system for its charging, for 
example with a solar collector. Replacing the battery is often 
impossible or impractical.  
Therefore, the power supply capacity of the battery of the 
sensor node is one of the most severely limited resources in 
the wireless sensor network. Moreover, for implementation 
of the wireless sensor network, it is important to take into 
account the optimization of energy consumption and to 
achieve maximum possible energy savings [10].  
Therefore, in this paper, an analysis of configurations of 
wireless sensor networks is carried out with regard to 
optimization of energy consumption. Optimization is 
analyzed in terms of selection of adequate topologies, node 
layouts, data collection and routing processes, as well as 
settings of network radio parameters. In Section II, selection 
of network technology used in further analysis is explained. 
In Section III, a comparative overview of energy 
consumption for different topologies of wireless sensor 
networks is presented. In Section IV, an analysis of adequate 
methods for data collection is performed. In Section V, 
additional analysis of configurations of radio parameters is 
conducted to select solutions that have appropriate range and 
energy efficiency. 
II. 
SELECTION OF NETWORK TECHNOLOGY 
Sensor nodes are characterized by small dimensions, low 
energy consumption, the ability to collect data via 
appropriate sensors, the ability to process data, and to 
support wireless communication within appropriate range. 
This concept enables the collection of data very close to the 
observed area, local aggregation of data and easy transfer of 
data to remote central locations intended for data collection 
and processing. Wireless sensor networks may contain a 
number of nodes located at relatively short distances from 
each other. Communication between nodes, as well as 
communication of nodes with the gateway can take place 
directly or through multiple nodes, within the so-called 
multi-hop 
topology, 
topology 
which 
extends 
the 
communication range [11]. 
Analyses of various aspects of wireless sensor networks 
implemented in rural environment are conducted hereafter to 
optimize operating parameters from the communications 
point of view. Optimization of wireless communication 
parameters is carried out with an aim of achieving fast and 
reliable communication with minimal energy consumption. 
Optimization is important for processes of directing the 
collected sensor data to a remote distant destination.

For use in agriculture and monitoring of environmental 
parameters, sensor networks are placed in remote locations, 
i.e., test fields. Therefore, it is necessary to use networking 
technologies that can achieve connectivity over long 
distances up to several tens of kilometers. For this reason, the 
application of short-range communication technologies (e.g., 
WiFi and ZigBee) is not suitable due to installation barriers 
of additional gateways, lack of suitable locations or 
inadequate electricity connectivity [12]. Although the 
deployment of communication via mobile networks meets 
the requirements on range and reliability, it is energy 
demanding and incurs additional costs in terms of a 
permanent subscriptions to the service provider. Hence, it is 
also not an optimal solution [13]. In addition to long range, 
the next important criterion in the selection of appropriate 
technologies is low energy consumption, so that the battery-
powered nodes achieve a sufficiently long autonomy and 
multi-year life expectancy. Therefore, technologies from the 
group of Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) 
technologies are suitable for application in precision 
agriculture scenarios [14]. LPWAN is the name for high-
range, low-power wireless technologies. The specifics of 
LPWAN technologies are low power consumption and long 
communication range for sending information over greater 
distances. These features make LPWAN technologies very 
practical for open area IoT implementations. There are many 
LPWAN technologies and new ones are constantly emerging 
and improving, but currently LoRa, Sigfox and Narrowband 
IoT (NB-IoT) are leaders in this field [15,16]. The advantage 
of application of these technologies in networking relates to 
the fact that the end devices working with these technologies 
are designed to consume energy efficiently and minimally 
[17]. Low power and narrow bandwidth allow very low 
power consumption when sending messages [18]. Due to the 
simplicity of LoRa deployment in the fields, this paper 
analyzes the application of LoRa in agriculture for 
monitoring environmental parameters and optimization of its 
energy consumption in related scenarios. Considering the 
range of communication, LoRa has sufficient range required 
for its application in rural areas [9]. 
III. 
SELECTION OF NETWORK TOPOLOGIES 
Through simulation procedures, networking scenarios 
using LoRa technology are analyzed. In these scenarios, 
sensor nodes communicate via a gateway with the rest of the 
network. The CupCarbon IoT simulator [19] is used for 
simulation and analysis of energy consumption during 
communication processes. For comparing topologies and 
selecting appropriate network topologies, a star topology is 
suitable for many and diverse IoT applications. However, in 
a number of scenarios, a more flexible network topology 
like decentralized multi-hop solution is needed [11]. 
Therefore, in order to compare the network topologies from 
the aspect of energy consumption, the star topology, i.e., 
one-hop topology, and topology in which linear structures 
are formed in clusters, i.e., multi-hop linear topologies, are 
selected, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The terminal devices 
in the access network are sensor nodes. 
Figure 1.  Star topology (one-hop). 
Figure 2.  Line topology within individual clusters (multi-hop). 
As presented in Figures 1 and 2, sensors measure data 
sent to the rest of the network via a gateway. Terminal 
devices, i.e. sensor nodes, rely on the gateway to transmit 
information from the access network to the network server. 
A. Star topology 
To start the analysis of energy consumption in different 
access network topologies, the star topology, topology in 
which each sensor node sends data directly to the gateway is 
chosen. The star topology is convenient for its ease of 
deployment.  
Figure 3 shows the access part of the network created in 
the CupCarbon IoT simulator which includes the sensor 
nodes, marked as s2 to s5, connected to the gateway. Figure 
3 also shows the radii of area coverage with signal for 
individual nodes, which depend on the area range each node 
needs to cover with its signal. Thus, for example, node s4 
needs a smaller signal coverage radius for covering the area 
up to the gateway, while node s2 needs a larger signal 
coverage radius so that the gateway can be reached, as 
presented in Figure 3. The ranges of area coverage with 
signal can be defined through an atpl parameter, which 
defines the percentage of signal coverage for each node in 
relation to the maximum possible coverage area, as defined 
in Table I for nodes s4 and s5. In the case when the specified 
parameter is not defined for the node, it is considered that the 
node covers the maximum possible area it can cover with its 
signal. As presented in Table I, the gateway waits for the 
data to be sent from the sensor nodes according to the 
randomly selected (randb) moment for data sending that has 
a certain time delay.

Figure 3.  Representation of communication between nodes in scenario 
with star topology.  
Figure 3 shows the star topology and communication 
among nodes in the access network. The illustration shows 
that the sensor nodes (s2, s3, s4 and s5) send data directly to 
the gateway. This is defined through a send parameter that 
defines which node sends data to which one. Thus, for 
example, the label send 1 1 in Table I defines that nodes s2, 
s3, s4 and s5 send one data packet to node 1, i.e., the 
gateway. The randb parameter is used to send data with a 
random delay variable x. In order to compare the topologies 
that can be used in communication between sensor nodes and 
the gateway, power consumption in the example of a star 
network topology is presented in Fig 4. According to the 
level of energy consumption shown in Figure 4, it can be 
seen that the sensor nodes closer to the gateway, i.e., s4 and 
s5, consume less energy than the more distant nodes, i.e., s2 
and s3. Further comparison of the results obtained should be 
possible when the results for different topologies are taken 
into account within a similar time period as indicated on the 
abscissa.

gateway 
B. Multi-hop linear topology 
Next, the topologies in which linear structures are formed 
in individual clusters, i.e., multi-hop linear topologies, are 
analyzed. Unlike in mesh, in these topologies network data 
collision issues could be mitigated so they are selected for 
the analysis of reliable network data transmission. 
1) 
Line topology within clusters with CH nodes closest 
to the gateway 
In the combination of line network topologies presented 
in Figure 5, some sensor nodes within individual clusters can 
communicate with each other, e.g., s2 and s4, as well as s3 
and s5. The so-called Claster Head (CH) nodes, nodes s4 
and s5, communicate directly with the gateway. They rely on 
the gateway to transmit information to the network server, as 
shown in Figure 5. The other nodes, s2 and s3, forward data 
in the direction of CH nodes. Devices are synchronized and 
wake up at specific moments in time to receive data packets 
from their neighbors, which they can combine with their own 
data packets and send further along the line. This scenario is 
created considering the conclusion given for the star 
topology that the distance of the nodes affects the energy 
consumption. Therefore, for the CH node within each 
cluster, the node closest to the gateway within the cluster is 
selected and its choice is fixed throughout the simulation 
process of network data transmission.  
Figure 5 illustrates the determined signal coverage radii 
for individual nodes. They depend on the range each sensor 
node needs to have to cover the area with its signal. In this 
scenario, it is assumed that, in order to cover the area up to 
the gateway, node s4 needs the same signal coverage radius 
as node s2 in order to reach node s4. The reason is a 
comparison of the impact of different frequencies of data 
transmission of nodes on energy consumption. From Figure 
5 it can be seen that sensor nodes s2 and s3 send data to 
nodes s4 and s5. The nodes s4 and s5 then send their data, as 
well as data received from nodes s2 and s3, directly to the 
gateway. The two clusters with line communication within 
nodes are created, one with s2 and s4, and one with s3 and 
s5, in which the CH nodes are nodes s4 and s5. According to 
the configuration of the parameters of nodes, it can be seen 
that the specified ranges of signal coverage are also defined 
through the atpl parameter.

For each node, the percentage of coverage area in 
relation to the maximum possible coverage area of the node 
is defined as presented in Table II for nodes s2, s3, s4 and 
s5. From Table II, it can be seen that nodes s4 and s5 need 
the same signal coverage radius for covering area up to the 
gateway, as radius of node s2 to reach node s4, as well as 
radius of node s3 to reach node s5. According to the level of 
energy consumption shown in Figure 6, it is evident that 
node s2 sends data more often than node s3, so its energy 
consumption is higher. The CH nodes, i.e., nodes s4 and s5, 
although the closest to the gateway, consume more energy 
than the more distant nodes, i.e., nodes s2 and s3. The 
reason for this is the fact that CH nodes receive data from 
nodes s2 and s3, and send them to the gateway along with 
their own data. The gateway waits for the data sent from the 
CH nodes according to the randomly selected moment for 
sending with a certain time delay. In this scenario, the total 
energy consumption is higher than in the star topology. 
2) 
Line topology within clusters with CH nodes 
furthest from the gateway 
 To avoid fast energy depletion of CH nodes selected in a 
fixed manner, this scenario gives the analysis of energy 
consumption of randomly selecting CH nodes, and not fixed 
ones, as in the previous example. In the combination of line 
network topologies within individual clusters shown in 
Figure 7, sensor nodes can communicate with each other, 
e.g., s2 and s4, as well as s3 and s5. For CH nodes, the data 
transmission process relies on the gateway to transmit 
information to the network server. In this example, the CH 
nodes are selected at random.  
Figure 6.  Energy consumption of LoRa technology in scenario with line 
topology within clusters and with CH nodes closest to the gateway. 
Figure 7.  Representation of communication between nodes in scenario 
with line topology within clusters and with CH nodes furthest from the 
gateway. 
For the CH node within each cluster at one point, as well 
as the nearest, the nodes furthest from the gateway can be 
selected, i.e., nodes s2 and s3. In Figure 7, the signal 
coverage radii for individual nodes are shown, depending on 
the area ranges that the nodes need to cover with their signal. 
Thus, for example, node s4 needs a smaller signal coverage 
radius covering the area up to node s2, compared to the 
necessary radius of node s2 for reaching the gateway. The 
same is true for the radii of nodes s3 and s5.  
According to the level of energy consumption shown in 
Figure 8, it can be seen that the sensor CH nodes, i.e., nodes 
s2 and s3, furthest from the gateway, consume more energy 
than nodes s4 and s5. At one point, nodes s4 and s5 send 
their data to the CH nodes s2 and s3, which then send these 
data to the gateway in addition to their own data.  
For a comparison with the energy consumption in the 
example of a line topology within a cluster with CH nodes 
closest to the gateway, a much higher energy consumption of 
CH nodes can be noted in this scenario. Moreover, the 
comparison of the results from Figures 4, 6, and 8 shows that 
in a star topology, unlike multi-hop topologies, the optimal 
scaling strategy of LoRa radio parameters can be achieved to 
obtain the long range communication while enabling the 
lowest energy consumption.  
As defined in Table III for nodes s4 and s5, the specified 
ranges of signal coverage radii are also defined through the 
atpl parameter. There is also the case when the specified atpl 
parameter is not defined for the node. In this case, it is 
considered that the node covers the maximum possible area 
that it can with its signal. This is the case for nodes s2 and 
s3. This allows for random selection of CH nodes as each 
node, from s2 to s5, is able to cover the area to the gateway 
with its signal.  
The random choice of CH nodes was selected in this 
scenario to analyze the possibility of reducing the energy 
depletion of certain CH nodes selected in a fixed manner, as 
it was the case in the previous scenario with the fastest 
energy depletion of CH nodes selected in a fixed manner, 
i.e., the ones closest to the gateway. However, the total 
amount of energy consumed within the observed time period 
in this scenario is the highest.

From the comparison of the results in Figures 4, 6, and 8 
it can be concluded that the star network topology can be 
considered as the best option with regard to cumulative 
energy consumption. 
IV. 
SELECTION OF ADEQUATE VOLUME OF NETWORK 
TRAFFIC 
The following scenarios are created with the aim of 
analyzing the impact of the amount of transmitted network 
traffic within the network on the energy consumption in the 
network. These scenarios aim to reduce energy consumption 
with adequate traffic volume, and to improve the range. The 
energy consumption control is considered and the rate 
adaptation for one-hop scenarios presented in Figure 9 is 
analyzed. For this purpose, the network topology shown in 
Figure 9 was created, which consists of sensor nodes, 
marked s2 to s7, and a remote gateway. Star topology is used 
for communication between nodes.  
Figure 9.  Communication between nodes for one-hop scenarios. 
In previous examples, the star topology was defined as 
more appropriate in terms of total energy consumption 
compared to the line structure within clusters. The radii of 
area coverage with signal for individual nodes are shown in 
Figure 9, so the node closest to the gateway has the smallest 
radius, i.e., node s3, while the nodes furthest from the 
gateway, i.e., nodes s5 and s7, have the largest radii. 
A. Sending an equal amount of traffic from nodes equally 
distant from the gateway 
As shown in Table IV, in this scenario, the gateway waits 
for data to be sent from the sensor nodes s2 to s7 and then 
reads the sent data x and proceeds with data forwarding. 
The largest radius for data transmission is used by nodes 
s5 and s7, which can be seen according to the omitted 
parameter atpl in Table IV. This implies usage of the entire 
available coverage radii of the nodes s5 and s7. This 
parameter is specified for nodes s2, s3, s4 and s6. It can be 
seen that node s3 uses the smallest radius (50% of the total 
largest possible radius). Data is sent continuously (loop), but 
a delay is made between sending individual data. This 
scenario corresponds to predefined data transmission 
moments in which all nodes send data at the same time 
intervals. This is a common case in rural scenarios for 
sending data collected from the field.  
Figure 10 shows the energy consumption when applying 
LoRa technology in a star network topology with the same 
amount of data sent from nodes equally distant from the 
gateway. Therefore, the same amount of data is sent from 
nodes s2 and s4, and the same amount of data from nodes s5 
and s7, so there are overlaps on the graph in energy 
consumption for these nodes. The node closest to the 
gateway, node s3 consumes the least energy for sending, 
while the most energy is consumed by the farthest nodes, 
nodes s5 and s7, whose energy will be depleted the fastest.

data sent from nodes equally distant from the gateway.

Figure 11.  Energy consumption in a star topology with different amounts 
of data sent from nodes equally distant from the gateway. 
It can be concluded that node placement in star topology 
presents an important determinant of sensor node life time. 
However, although the nodes should be as close as possible 
to the gateway to reduce energy consumption, at the same 
time, adequate coverage of area with the signal must be 
achieved. With regard to the energy depletion of individual 
nodes, the star topology is more suitable for application in 
sensor networks than a cluster topology 
In cluster topology, the energy of CH nodes is depleted 
the fastest. CH nodes are difficult to replace, which causes 
the loss of functionality of the entire cluster, while in a star 
topology, the depletion of energy of an individual node does 
not cause such a loss in data delivery from the area which it 
covers with its signal. 
B. Sending different amounts of traffic from nodes equally 
distant from the gateway 
The parameters listed in Table V are similar to the data 
from the previous scenario, except that data from some 
nodes is sent more frequently. Despite the same distance of 
nodes s2 and s4 from gateway, more data is sent from node 
s2 to the gateway than from node s4. Moreover, from node 
s5 data is sent to the gateway more often than from node s7, 
although both nodes are equally distant from the gateway.  
Figure 11 shows the energy consumption when applying 
LoRa technology in a star network topology with different 
amounts of data sent from nodes equidistant from the 
gateway. Therefore, different amount of data is sent from 
nodes s2 and s4, and different amount of data from nodes s5 
and s7, so there are no overlaps on the graph in energy 
consumption for these nodes. The node closest to the 
gateway, node s3 consumes the least energy required for 
sending. The most energy is consumed by the farthest node 
s5. Moreover, it sends more data compared to node s7, which 
is at the same distance from the gateway as node s5.

Figure 12.  Energy consumption of LoRa technology in a star topology with 
the less frequent sending of data from sensor nodes to the gateway. 
The node s5 consumes more energy than node s7. From 
the results, it can be concluded that in scenarios where 
sending a larger amount of data is not necessary, as in the 
case of monitoring the state of yield, energy savings should 
be achieved by sending an adequately determined smaller 
volume of data from sensors. 
C. Less frequent data transmission 
The parameters listed in Table VI are similar to the data 
from the previous scenario, except that data from nodes is 
sent less frequently, which is seen by a higher value of the 
delay parameter that defines the time delay between sending 
individual data. In this scenario, data is sent twice as rarely 
compared to the previous scenario. 
Figure 12 shows the energy consumption using LoRa 
network access and star network topology. In this scenario, 
less frequent sending of data from sensor nodes to gateway 
is analyzed and compared with the scenario presented in 
Figure 11. From the comparison of the presented results, 
significantly less energy consumption can be noted within 
the same time interval when sending data with higher delay, 
i.e., less frequently. LoRa technology has adequate features 
for usage in wireless sensor networks if long-range 
communication with minimal power consumption should be 
achieved. LoRa supports data transmission with lower 
requirements for high transfer speeds and transfer of large 
amounts of data. Thus, as can be concluded from the 
presented results, the application of LoRa technology is an 
adequate solution in IoT scenarios where fast transmission 
of large amounts of data is not required, as in precision 
agriculture, where additional energy savings can be 
achieved by sending smaller amounts of data over longer 
periods of time between transmissions.

D. Effect of SF and CR parameters on Consumed Energy 
The LoRa access based wireless sensor network 
implemented in the field serves to connect sensor nodes 
located in different remote locations to centrally located 
storage and advanced data processing servers. The 
communication should be achieved in an energy efficient 
way. It can be highlighted that the range of communication 
in the fields and open spaces presents one of the most 
important parameters because it is necessary to ensure the 
energy efficient transmission of data over relatively long 
distances. In that case, the high data transfer rate is not so 
significant. The parameters 
described 
hereafter, the 
spreading factor and the coding rate, affect transmission 
range and energy efficiency. 
The Spreading Factor (SF) presents the number of chips 
per symbol. Its value is an integer number between 6 and 12. 
The greater the SF value, the more capability the receiver has 
to move away the noise from the signal. Thus, the greater the 
SF value, the more time is taken to send a packet, but a 
higher range will also be achieved because the sensitivity of 
the receiver is better. Thus, for example, if the expansion 
factor is minimal, i.e., SF = 6, a higher speed can be 
achieved, but with a reduction in the possible range.  
The expression for Coding Rate (CR) is CR =4/(4+n), 
where n is a value from 1 to 4. It denotes that each four 
useful bits are encoded by 5, 6, 7 or 8 transmission bits. The 
smaller the coding rate is, the higher the time on air is to 
transmit data. Prolonged data transfer time will also affect 
battery consumption. 
The analysis of the effect of different values of SF and 
CR LoRa radio parameters on consumed energy and range is 
performed hereafter.

Figure 13.  Energy consumption of LoRa technology in a star topology with 
SF=7, and CR=4/8. 
 As already stated, when the SF value is high, the time 
for data transmission increases which means that the sensor 
node consumes more power to transmit data. As presented in 
Figure 14, the SF expansion factor is set to a maximum value 
of 12, unlike in the case shown in Figure 13 where the SF is 
set to a value of 7. The reason for setting a high SF value is 
to maximize the transmission range as one of the most 
important factors in the field deployments.  
Furthermore, when the coding rate increases, the data 
transmission time and the consumed energy decrease. 
Therefore, in the case when a long range needs to be 
ensured, energy consumption can be regulated by the CR 
factor, as presented in Figures 13 and 14. The energy 
consumption shown in Figure 14 would have been higher if 
the same CR factor had been used as in the example shown 
in Figure 13. By increasing the CR value from 4/8 to 4/5, 
energy consumption can be reduced while maintaining the 
maximal range enabled by the high SF parameter value. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
LoRa technology can be applied in agriculture to 
monitor 
environmental 
parameters. 
It 
is 
used 
for 
communication among remote sensor nodes located in test 
fields in order to achieve energy efficient communication. 
The LoRa system aims at pushing optimization of energy 
consumption further while maintaining a long range, hence 
the scenarios for implementation of LoRa solutions in 
precision agriculture have been analyzed in this paper. LoRa 
sensor 
network 
implementation 
for 
monitoring 
of 
environmental parameters in agriculture is analyzed.  
The specifics of LoRa technology are low power 
consumption and long communication range used in 
sending information over large distances.

The biggest drawback is the low speed of data 
transmission and the limited amount of data that can be sent. 
For LoRa based environmental monitoring, high throughput 
and high transfer rate are not of great importance since, 
generally, small amounts of data is transmitted. Basically, 
mainly numerical values representing readings of different 
types of sensors that monitor plant parameters and their 
close environment are sent. Therefore, it is important to 
achieve long-range communication with minimal energy 
consumption, with lower requirements for the amount and 
frequency of data transfer.  
In this paper, LoRa star, i.e., one-hop, and multi-hop 
linear topologies have been compared. Considering 
cumulative energy consumption of sensor nodes in the 
network, the star topology is identified as the one which 
could better fit lower energy consumption in the presented 
scenarios. Moreover, the presented simulation results show 
that, for a star topology, optimal scaling strategy of LoRa 
radio parameters necessary for environmental monitoring 
can be achieved to obtain the long range while enabling low 
energy consumption. The presented results show that 
optimizing LoRa parameters, such as SF and CR, with 
regard to the required long range communication is a key 
element to reduce the consumed energy by the sensor nodes. 
Since the SF factor must have the highest possible value to 
achieve a greater range of communication necessary for 
precision agriculture, the presented results show that in that 
case the CR should be as high as possible to reduce total 
energy consumption. The presented findings of the effect of 
the studied network elements on the energy consumption 
collected through conducted simulations are important for 
further research activities in the field of LoRa based 
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture in rural 
areas.  
For a multi-hop linear topologies, energy consumption 
can also be optimized by applying different radio 
configurations for different network layouts. In these 
topologies, the density of nodes plays a determinant role in 
coverage and number of hops. Therefore, future work will 
include analysis of optimization of energy consumption in 
multi-hop 
networks 
by 
exploiting 
various 
radio 
configurations and the network topologies (e.g., the number 
of hops, the network density, the coverage), and a strategy 
to take advantage of combination of both star and multi-hop 
topologies will be proposed.
