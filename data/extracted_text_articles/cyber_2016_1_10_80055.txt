Abstract—For any organization to maintain a strong 
cyber security posture, it is important to test readiness 
and capabilities of cyber security teams and the tools that 
they use. In order to design and conduct experiments to 
assess performance of defensive cyber security teams and 
tools, it is crucial to either ensure the test range accurately 
represents the real environment in which the defensive 
teams or tools normally would operate or to ensure that 
testing is conducted across a suite of test ranges that 
provides comprehensive coverage of the potential real-life 
network environments.  In this paper, we present a novel 
network complexity scoring framework that is designed 
to capture the set of the network attributes that have the 
principal impact on the performance of defenders and 
defensive tools and to differentiate networks according to 
defensive difficulty.

 INTRODUCTION 
No longer a newly emerging issue, cyber security is a 
continuing and rapidly growing challenge, facing all 
organizations, whether small, large, public, or private.  Thus, 
added to conventional risk management, there is an 
imperative to manage cyber risk by a combination of building 
and maintaining a strong cyber security readiness posture, as 
well as other approaches, such as cyber insurance.   Cyber 
security readiness depends on knowledge skills, regular 
training of cyber security defenders, in addition to the 
organization’s information technology architecture, cyber 
security policies, enforcement of these policies, defensive 
technologies, and many other contributing elements of cyber 
readiness.  To train cyber security staff and develop defensive 
skills, many organizations have initiated regular red-blue 
challenges, with real or automated “red” cyber adversaries 
attacking a virtual organization that “blue” cyber defenders 
are tasked to defend, on cyber ranges that are intended to 
emulate the organization’s real networks.  In addition, cyber 
defensive technology companies validate and demonstrate 
their tools, similarly, on cyber ranges.  In either of these 
emerging applications, it is critical to develop a notion of the 
complexity of the network on which the red-blue gaming or 
performance testing is conducted in order to understand cyber 
defensive performance.   
Many notions of complexity have been explored 
heretofore and Wikipedia, [11], has a nice overview of 
several of these, but an immediate observation from 
examining the Wikipedia page is that there is great variation 
in the definition across applications.  Most specific previous 
descriptions of complexity and research in modeling network 
complexity, such as the research presented in [2][3][7], was 
primarily focused in other application areas either non-
specific to or other than cyber security, so that work could not 
be directly leveraged for our purposes.  In addition, a number 
of the earlier efforts are primarily qualitative in nature, such 
as [1], and therefore did not align with our objectives for this 
research.  Some previous efforts that were closer to the 
computer network application area, like [4], either were 
focused on a different objectives or overly simplified the 
problem, employing tabular approaches to compute network 
complexity scores that were too limited to capture subtleties 
of connectivity between nodes and only allowed a linear type 
of model, so these methods were insufficient for our 
purposes.  Other methods focused only on a narrow sub-set 
of aspects of complexity that impact defensive difficulty, 
ignoring many other important factors, so, again, the 
limitations of other approaches forced us to explore a new 
technique to model network complexity.   However, despite 
the various shortcoming enumerated above, many of these 
antecedent approaches have influenced our efforts.    
This paper introduces a hybrid complexity modeling 
approach that treats the network in a multimodal fashion, 
encapsulating certain parameter like numbers or operating 
systems or number of device types hyper edges of a 
hypergraph, abstracting them as attributes of the associated 
subnets or the network itself, but maintaining flexibility to 
model more complicated network properties.  Many global 
network and subnet-specific single-parameter attributes are 
captured with a tabular method.  Concepts of complexity that 
are distributed in nature, related to connectivity, or describe 
the balance of a specific property across the network are

analyzed using information theoretic and related approaches 
that better address those concepts.    For example, certain 
aspects of subnet and router topology are better described 
with information theoretic model and corresponding 
complexity analysis.   
To demonstrate the efficacy and overall utility of our 
complexity model, we developed numerous networks, some 
devised on paper and other actual cyber range networks, each 
emphasizing different network attributes.  By analyzing this 
collection of varied networks, we were able to explore the 
model behaviors as we vary scoring parameters and confirm 
that the model parameters and network properties interact in 
the way that the algorithms were designed.  As one of the 
scored networks, we also examine a virtual, large financial 
network used for cyber range training of cyber security 
defenders. For the large financial network case, we developed 
parsing routines to collect network attribute values from 
configuration files for the cyber range, demonstrating the 
potential for automating the complexity computations.  This 
exercise directly supports a future in which the input 
accumulation, analysis, and complexity scoring can be 
accomplished by automated tools.   
The remainder of this manuscript describes the proposed 
network complexity model in greater detail and is organized 
as follows.  Section II describes the technical details of our 
model and how it describes the complexity of a network that 
pertains to cyber security defensive difficulty. Section III 
describes the performance and provides results of applying 
our network complexity model to multiple networks that 
possess sufficient variety of the values of the attributes that 
we deemed crucial to network complexity. Section V offers 
our conclusions. Finally, the acknowledgment and reference 
sections complete the manuscript. 
II. 
TECHNICAL DETAILS 
We begin this section by describing the fundamental 
design of the network complexity model and the notations that 
we will be using throughout the manuscript. The primary 
purpose of the network complexity model is to distinguish 
between different networks in a manner that agrees with 
intuitive notions of cyber defensive difficulty.  As mentioned 
previously, we have adopted a hybrid approach that includes 
both tabular and information theoretic components to 
incorporate contributions from both global single-value 
attributes and distributed attributes, such as connectivity.  
Thus, the model is designed with the flexibility to 
accommodate both linear, weighted combinations of attributes 
and as well as more complicated functions to describe 
attribute contributions.   
Attributes were selected based on several primary 
premises. We first considered attributes that describe the scale 
of the network, including numbers of devices and numbers of 
accounts.   Then, we incorporated attributes that capture 
complexity in the structure or topology of the network, 
including organization of subnetworks, router connectivity, 
multiple security zones, and other similar concepts.  Finally, 
we included attributes that directly impact the level of 
defensive effort or increase the attack surface.   
Table 1, below, enumerates the attributes that comprise 
our network complexity model.  It contains a list of network 
complexity attributes that contribute to the network 
complexity algorithm and a rating for the differentiation 
enabled by that attribute.  In addition, table 1 provides a 
differentiation rating for that attribute’s relative contribution 
to the network complexity algorithm.

The differentiation ratings have 2 values, 1 or 2, and indicate 
the relative differentiation provided by that attribute.   Thus, 
attributes with differentiation rating level 1 contribute to the 
complexity score in a way that distinguishes between 
network to a greater degree than level 2 attributes.  There are 
numerous other potential attributes that were deemed of less 
significance and would provide level 3 or lower of 
differentiation, and therefore not critical to include in this 
stage of the network complexity algorithm design.  
There is no standard accepted definition of cyber 
defensive network complexity, so our fundamental goal was 
simply to design an algorithm that best suits our intended 
applications, in this case the evaluation of cyber defensive 
performance of cyber security teams, operators, or tools 
operating on a network, measured against the complexity of 
the network.  As such, attribute contribution to network cyber 
complexity was designed to match notions of cyber defensive 
impact.   To accomplish this, multiple iterations of functions 
were explored to capture the contribution of each attribute. 
Primarily, three types of functions were utilized to represent 
complexity attribute contributions.  For some attributes, a 
linear, tabular approach best was able to achieve the desired 
contribution.  In other cases, non-linear functions featuring 
the product of 2 attributes was most suited to capture the 
complexity.  For yet other attributes, an information theoretic 
approach is used to map a custom probability function analog 
to information content, which is used to represent 
complexity.  In most cases, a log scale, either base 2 or 10, is 
used to transform raw attribute quantities of very different 
orders of magnitude to similar magnitude ranges and yet 
retain the desired differentiation.

One of our sub-goals is to assess the structural or 
topological complexity of a modern day computer network as 
an element of our overall complexity model.  The density of 
edges or connectivity are concepts that come to mind.  They 
are related to measures of the importance or centrality of the 
nodes.  Centrality measures are commonly used for this 
purpose, as described in [9] and [5].  Degree centrality, 
Bonacich 
centrality, 
closeness 
or 
path 
centrality, 
betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality are well 
known examples.  The degree of nodes in a network is useful 
to describe connectivity but that may not correspond to 
defensive complexity.  Towards that end, we developed 
several new concepts for complexity, including hop 
complexity, subnet complexity, and others.   
To measure hop complexity, we adapted an approach 
utilized in [8].  First, we specify that the hop count 
corresponds to the number of hops for traffic to traverse the 
shortest path of the network between a particular vertex and 
each other vertex in the network.  In this complexity sub-
model, the aforementioned functional is defined as: 
 
 
(1) 
 
The router, ri , is one of Nr routers in the network.  The 
parameter beta, ,is selected empirically to help differentiate 
between multiple networks based on hop complexity.  The 
functions Sm(ri), in the exponent, enumerate the number of 
routers that can be reached within m hops of router ri and 
scale each such hop value tally by a corresponding combining 
coefficient, cm. Utilizing the gf function we can construct a 
related function p for router ri as follows:  
 
 
 
(2) 
Thus, for beta greater than one, the value will be greater 
for a router which has more routers that can be reached within 
a certain hop count, all else remaining the same, and we will 
use that function p to compute information content [10] of the 
network, based on the hop complexity, as follows:  
 
(3) 
We observe that the protocol complexity is a 
complementary attribute to hop complexity and measures the 
number of types of traffic traversing the network, so we 
combine these two attributes in one measure by forming the 
product.  Our intuition suggests that this contribution element 
is potentially an analog for flow complexity.    
The subnet complexity is computed in a similar manner 
except that the probability function is defined as a simpler 
and more intuitive ratio of the number of nodes in the subnet 
divided by the total number of nodes in the network.   
  
 
(4) 
The information content or associated complexity 
computation is the identical formula as previously used to 
compute the router connectivity.   
 
(5)  
Other attributes contribute to our complexity model 
through straightforward, tabular functions.  For example, this 
approach is used to capture the complexity associated with 
the diversity of technology deployed on the network.  The 
distribution of operating systems and device types across the 
subnets are scaled and summed.  A slightly more complicated 
contribution results from pairs of attributes, such as 
administrative domains and user accounts, that contribute as 
a scaled product of the direct values.     
Employing the approaches described above, to capture 
complexity contributions from all the attributes enumerated 
in table 1, we have developed a network complexity model 
that provides strong differentiation between networks to 
enhance scoring of cyber range defensive and offensive 
testing and war-gaming.  In the next section, we will discuss 
the results of applying the model to a variety of networks of 
different size, structure, and technological diversity.   
III. 
RESULTS 
To explore the ability of the model to distinguish key 
differences in network structure or other attributes that 
impact network complexity, we developed more than 10 
networks that we modeled and analyzed.   The largest 
network, named the large financial network (LFN) has the 
largest size, most intricate structure, and generally the high 
degree of all contributing complexity factors.  Following that 
are three similar networks with 8 routers but differing 
distributions of machines across subnets and router nodes.  
Clearly demonstrated throughout the results in this section, 
the scoring model was designed such that evenly distributed 
networks contribute the most defensive complexity, whereas 
the networks with the greatest degree of clustering of 
machines within fewer subnets pose slightly less defensive 
complexity.  Finally, there are multiple 5 node and 4 node 
networks arranged with three different connection graphs: all 
the routers in a line, all the routers connected in a ring, and 
full connectivity between all the routers.  These example 
networks demonstrate that the networks which require the 
greatest number of hops for traffic to traverse the network 
tend to incur a higher score in our cyber defensive complexity 
model, which matches the design objectives.  
In this section, we explore the attribute contributions to 
the overall cyber network complexity score for each of the 
test networks.  Figure 1 illustrates the hop complexity sub-
score generated by our model, measured for each of the test 
networks.

Figure 1: This scatter graph plots the complexity scores, assigned to 
the selected networks based on the network topology, as measured 
by hop counts for the various routers, versus the parameter beta.  
Note that the value 1.2 provides the greatest differentiability.  
Since the hop complexity, shown in figure 1, captures 
topological and structural complexity of the network, 
captured through a measure of router interconnectivity, we 
decided to combine hope complexity with the complexity 
resulting from the number of protocols that must be supported 
on that very network with the described topology.  Thus, 
figure 2 illustrates the product of hop complexity with 
protocol complexity 
 
Figure 2:  This scatter graph plots the complexity derived from the 
hop complexity and the protocol traffic traversing the network.  It is 
plotted versus the parameter beta. Note that a beta value of 
approximately 1.2 provides the maximum differentiability.  
As described in the technical details section, the router 
hop and network protocol derived complexity measures scale 
with the degree of asymmetry in the distribution of hop 
complexity across the network routers as well as directly with 
the number of protocols traversing the network.  This 
relationship is dependent on the parameter beta and as we can 
see the value 1.2 seems to maximize the differentiability of 
this complexity measure.   
In figures 3 and 4, we can see the influence of the 
distribution of device types and operating systems in the 
network.  These complexity measures are directly linked to 
numbers of device types and operating systems, as well as  
the subnet distribution complexity for these quantities.

complexity impact overall complexity scores for each of the 
different networks.

deployed on the various subnetworks of the network.

complexity model is illustrated in figure 6. Notice how the

subnet complexity scores scale with the distribution of 
subnets and machines across the various test networks.   
 
 
Figure 5:  This bar chart shows the complexity derived from 
firewalls and external interfaces of the overall network.   
For example, we see that FPJ 8N NW2 incurs the highest 
complexity score since it has the most nodes by a significant 
factor, and those nodes are distributed fairly evenly.  Then, 
FPJ 8N NW1 has the second highest complexity sub-score 
because it has significantly fewer nodes, but those nodes are 
arranged evenly.  Finally, FPJ 8N NW has the lowest sub-
score, because, although it contains the same number of  
 
 
Figure 6: This plot shows scores generated by the subnet functional 
designed to measure complexity due to topology and machine 
distribution, based on an information theoretic approach.  
nodes as NW1, those nodes are distributed asymmetrically 
across the subnets of the network, reducing the complexity 
slightly relative to NW1.   
 
Figure 7: This scatter plot captures the total complexity of the 
network, summing each of the contributing elements, including 
hops, protocols, device types, operating systems, administrative 
domains, 
user 
accounts, 
administrative 
domains, 
subnet 
distribution, and numbers of machines. 
Finally, in figure 7, we see a scatter plot showing the overall 
cyber defensive complexity score computed by superposition 
of all the complexity model attribute sub-scores.  Since the 
overall scoring model retains the parameter beta, utilized in 
the hop and protocol complexity sub-model, the overall score 
is also a function of beta.  However, as discussed earlier, a 
value of approximately 
1.2 produced the greatest 
differentiation between the various test networks.   Thus, the 
overall complexity score would be approximately 6.11 for the 
LFN network, 5.45 for the FPJ 8N NW2 network, 5.24 for 
the FPJ 8N NW1 network, 5.19 for the FPJ 8N NW network, 
4.85 for the 5 node line network, 4.81 for the 5 node ring 
network, 4.81 for the 5 node fully connected network, and 
4.68 for the 4 node networks.    
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this research, we have explored the efficacy of using a 
hybrid approach involving network theory, information 
theory, and tabular functions to model the cyber defensive 
complexity of various test networks.   The results presented in 
this paper demonstrate that our model is able to differentiate 
between a selection of networks with varying attributes.   
Future work will involve incorporation of new attributes, such 
as supported applications, inclusion of cloud services, and 
other features that will enhance the model.
