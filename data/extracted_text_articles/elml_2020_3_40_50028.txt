Abstract- Sometimes, it is interesting to approach an academic
laboratory class from a different perspective. This paper takes
on the experience of a group of mechatronic engineering
students taking an academic course on laboratory of integral
electronics. The students were asked to design a system capable
of measuring three vital signs of a patient. To achieve this, they
use the knowledge acquired in their career up to that moment
to manage other knowledge that was required. In order to
carry out the project, a project-based learning methodology
was followed. This experience allowed the students involved to
solve a real problem with a product that responded to the
specifications of cost, portability and information available
from a mobile device, as well as meeting the requirements to
revalidate their laboratory subject matter.
Keywords - project-based learning; vital signs; sensors;
mobile applications.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The realization of projects that introduce students to the
solution of real-life problems that are related to a particular
subject constitutes a commonly employed method within
engineering. Often referred to as the Project Based Learning
(PBL) technique, it was defined as a formal method by the
end of the XIX century by William Heard Kilpatrick [1]. It
was renewed during the decade from 1960s as it became
popular again, and continued to be used up to current days.
In [2], PBL is defined as a methodology that enables
students to obtain the required knowledge and key skills
from the XXI century, through the development of projects
that address and solve real life problematics. Some of the
core features are:
1)
The
students
are
capable
of
becoming
the
protagonists of their own learning as they develop their
autonomy and responsibility, since they are in charge of
planning, organizing the work, and elaborating the product
that attempts to overcome the established problematic.
2)
The teachers change their main role to a support
and guidance role.
3)
It enables users to obtain relevant and discipline-
related skills, some of which are: teamwork, problem
solving, responsibility, spoken and written communication,
analysis
and
synthesis
of
gathered
data,
experiment
development, socializing with external environments to
college, among others [3].
Despite this method being defended by multiple authors,
researchers
and
teachers,
it
is
relevant
to
take
into
consideration some unfavorable elements that come with it.
For instance we can mention the implementation costs, the
location
where
the
project
will
be
developed,
the
communication towards the final users who will be using
the product, and finally, the time accessibility regarding the
involved students due to the project being developed in
parallel with the rest of the college classes. In order to
implement this didactic technique, a ten-step methodology
(see Table I), was followed.

order
to
collectively answer the starting question.
10
Appraisal and self-appraisal. The teacher must evaluate
the work in compliance with a defined rubric and propose
a self-appraisal activity to the students.
Under the previously described context, this work has as
its purpose to show an experience applying PBL. The work
has been performed during the period between August and
December 2019 for the laboratory of integral electronics
class,
in
the
seventh
semester
of
the
mechatronic
engineering career, Tec de Monterrey, campus Laguna,
Mexico. As the class name implies, the course proposes the
realization of 8 to 10 laboratory practices in which the
students get to apply the acquired knowledge from two
subjects from previous semesters: electronics and applied
electronics.
The
student’s
work
culminates
with
an
integrating project. For a few years, this project has been
oriented towards the design and construction of a domotic
house, where a series of electronic devices and sensors
guarantee three basic elements: comfort, security and the
saving of non-renewable resources.

In this course, we came with the idea of changing the
project’s subject to a new one: the construction of a device
that allows the measurement of three vital signs from a
person. The idea had as its background other similar works
developed by this paper’s author with students from eighth
and ninth semester from the mechatronic engineering career.
Some questions arose from this idea: Can a mechatronic
engineering student from seventh semester accomplish this
task? What knowledge the student does not master, but
needs to apply on the design, nonetheless? Is one semester
enough time for its execution? The idea was proposed at the
beginning of the course to a group of 14 students, from
which, 5 students felt motivated and committed to its
construction. The goals of the work were defined as shown
in Table II.
TABLE II. GENERAL AND SPECIFIC GOALS OF THE WORK
Main
goal
To apply the PBL approach in order to solve a real-life
problem, within a class from seventh semester of
mechatronic engineering.
Specific
goals
1. To design, mount and test a mechatronic device that
allows a real time measurement of temperature, blood’s
oxygen and an electrocardiographic signal from a
patient while it is displayed on a mobile device.
2. To encourage the obtainment of new knowledge not
seen in class.
3. To promote teamwork among the students.
4. Spoken and written presentation of a functional
designed prototype.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes
the approach taken to address the proposed project. Section
3 covers the results achieved until the writing of this paper,
which are not definitive as it is a work-in-progress. Finally,
in Section 4, conclusions are discussed.

METHODOLOGY
As it can be appreciated, part of the student’s group
followed the traditional final project while a group of five
students chose to participate in this new experience. With
the latter ones, a group was formed whose students were
exempt from making the regular laboratory practices, so
they could dedicate their whole time and attention to the
solution
of
the
established
challenge.
Taking
into
consideration the methodology to apply PBL, the following
stages were presented:
1)
Starting
question:
Is
it
possible
to
design
a
mechatronic device capable of measuring three vital signs
from a person, with the device being portable, low cost, and
accessible from a mobile device?
2) Selection of a team leader.
3) Design of the rubrics to evaluate the project and the
definition of the required skills:
a) Discipline: To design, build, and test prototypes of
innovative mechatronic devices.

6) This point summarizes the stages 6 and 7 of the PBL
methodology, applying the general steps of the Ulrich-
Eppinger mechatronic product design methodology [4].
7) At the moment of writing of this paper, phases 8, 9
and 10, from the PBL methodology, were in process.
III. PARTIAL RESULTS
To present the results obtained so far, we refer to stages 3
and 5 of the PBL methodology. In stage 3, it was very
important
to
verify
the
acquisition
of
the
defined
disciplinary and transversal competences. Stage 5 allowed
to determine what was the new knowledge that students had
to manage independently.
The disciplinary competence proposed the construction,
assembly and testing of a prototype enabling to measure
three vital human signs: temperature, oxygen concentration
in blood and an electrocardiographic signal.
The block diagram in Figure 1 presents the process of the
prototype.

Next,
a
brief
explanation
is
given
about
the
implementation and obtained results, with the help of the
block diagram, and gained knowledge.
A. Temperature Measurement
The temperature module of the system consists of the
MLX90614 sensor [5], which is an infrared thermometer
suitable for measuring temperatures in the necessary range
between 20°C and 50 °C, with digital outputs of 17 bits. The
sensor provides an output using the I2C protocol for
maximum resolution (0.02°C). The sensor has a default
range of temperatures between -40 °C and +85 °C. The
given temperature value is the average temperature of the
object detected by the sensing field from the device. The
accuracy of the sensor is of 0.5 °C at room temperature at
25 °C. This sensor is compatible with the analog pins of
Arduino.
The temperature data obtained through the device was
compared against measurements made with a thermometer,
as shown in Table IV. Observe that the collected data in
both cases is very similar.

B. Measurement of Oxygen Concentration in Blood
The oxygen sensor was designed from scratch. The SpO2
sensor (oxygen concentration in blood) [6] is based on the
principle of pulse oximetry. It generates two beams of light,
one of them in the red light spectrum (wavelength: 600nm-
750nm) and the other in the infrared spectrum (wavelength:
850nm - 1000nm) and measures the amount of light that is
transmitted through the index ﬁnger and reaches the 
photodetector, in this case a photodiode connected to a
current/voltage
converter
made
out
of
operational
ampliﬁers. 
The oximeter is composed of three main parts: the
optical sensor, the conditioning circuit, and the processing
board. Table V shows the readings obtained by the
DelphiCare’s
oxygen
sensor,
compared
against
a
commercial sensor.

C. Electrocardiograph
There is a large number of circuits that measure the
electrocardiographic signal.
One of the goals of the
DelphiCare was to obtain a system that was low cost and
had a large portability in comparison with similar systems.
Finally, a circuit that obtains a signal from the heart was
chosen and built. As it is shown in the block diagram in
Figure 1, the signal is obtained through a series of electrodes
connected to the chest of the user. After collecting the said
signal, it is then subjected to several amplifications and
filters, so it becomes easier to be identified and to work with
before reaching the analog port of the Arduino board and
finally being transferred to the mobile app. The resultant
signal is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Resultant electrocardiographic signal.
D. Processing Board, BT Module and Mobile Application
The goal of the mobile application is to offer the user an
intuitive and reliable way to communicate with the different
sensors.
The
application
is
planned
to
perform
a
synchronization process with a server in order to store the
incoming information in a database; the server shall display
that data on a Web platform for physicians to analyze. In
other words, the objective of the mobile application is to
serve as a bridge between the user, the sensor and the server.
The application shows a main menu where the user is
prompted to choose a sensor to start a reading (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Mobile application menu and discovered bluetooth devices.
Before any reading is performed, the user must connect
the mobile device to the DelphiCare device by means of an
RFCOMM
channel
established
via
bluetooth.
The
application is capable of starting the connection from
within, so the user does not need to minimize the
application nor use the phone’s built-in configuration app in
order to start trading data with the sensor.
The user is able to select a device to establish a
connection with, and once done, the buttons to start the
measurements with any of the three integrated sensors on
the DelphiCare are enabled.
As expected, there are three main use cases: measure
heart
rate,
measure
blood
oxygen
concentration,
and
measure body temperature. In the first case, the user will be
asked to put the electrodes on their chest and press the
confirmation button in order to start the reading process.
Once the measuring is finished, the user will be shown a
graph with the acquired data plotted in order to achieve a
proper visualization. In the second and third case, where the
user
can
measure
their
oxygen
saturation
and
body
temperature, the user will be asked to insert their index
finger into the corresponding finger grip and wait a couple
of seconds before showcasing the results.
Currently, the application is designed to work on
Android devices only, as it is still being used as a proof of
concept. The Java programming language was selected as
the technology for development because it is highly flexible
and, contrary to the most recent Android development
language released, Kotlin, Java has a huge legacy, and,
therefore,
the
learning
curve
is
very
straightforward.
Moreover, there is an enormous amount of online resources
available for research.
E. New Knowledge Management Required
As expected, this project required to manage the
following information:
1)
Arduino UNO board. This board was studied and
used in order to take advantage of its analog ports, voltage
source of 3.3V, the MLX 90614 library (used for infrared
thermometers),
functions
for
reading
analog
inputs,
outputting and signal filtering.
2)
Oxygen
concentration
in
blood:
the
use
of
optoelectronic techniques (visible and infrared light), pulse
oximetry, light absorption principle (Beer-Lambert law).
3) Electrocardiographic signal: use of high gain sensors
aimed to sense biomedic signals.
4) Wireless communication through a Bluetooth module.
5) Mobile app design using Android Studio and the Java
Programming Language.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we reported on the student’s progress
throughout their experience in designing a system capable
of measuring three vital signs of a patient. This project has
shown
how
the
students
had
experimented
and
accomplished the established goals using the Project Based
Learning method. As for the project itself, it is highly
interesting to observe how current technology can be
integrated into past technology in order to renew it and scale
it towards more complex systems. The usage of mobile
phones for daily and recurrent services has successfully
proven to be easier and cheaper, in this case, there was no
difference. This powerful tool will certainly allow for future
escalation and spreading of the DelphiCare system.
As noted before, this work was submitted to be
considered before completing all the phases from the PBL
methodology. However, it is worth mentioning some results
and information gained through the process:
1-
A
prototype
from
a
mechatronic
device
was
implemented, allowing the measurement of three vital signs
of a human being, applying the PBL approach. The device is
simple, portable and low cost (lower than 3000 MXN
pesos).
2- Through the course of the semester, the students showed
progress,
which
was
proved
by
oral
and
written
presentations, partial and final tests, which were received
and evaluated with their corresponding rubric form.
3- In order to reach a solution, the students had to apply the
gained knowledge.
4- The project covered 80% of the program from the class,
from a different didactic approach.
