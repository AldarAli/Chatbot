Abstract— In several side-on configurations, the monitoring of 
blast wave requires sensor with very low response time (< 1 µs). 
The sensing area of commercial sensors are too high to fulfill 
this specification. New transducers are focused on miniature 
membrane (diameter < 100 µm), but with optical transduction 
which suffers from low integration capabilities for multiple 
transducers. In this communication, a miniature piezoresistive 
pressure transducer based on silicon membrane and silicon 
gauges is designed and fabricated. Shock tube characterizations 
of the sensor have shown promising dynamic behavior, with a 
rise time of 30 ns and a response time lower than 1 µs thanks to 
the membrane fundamental resonant frequency of 20 MHz. 
Undesirable mechanical effects leading to the response drift 
after 1 µs are discussed and interpreted as the result of the 
holder deformation.

 INTRODUCTION  
Blast waves monitoring is required for many civilian and 
military 
applications, 
and 
especially 
for 
explosives 
characterization. In this case, and for supersonic shock wave, 
the side-on over-pressure (i.e., when the transducer surface is 
parallel to the flow velocity) reaches quasi-instantaneously  
(< 10 ns) a maximum Pmax (from several bar to several ten of 
bar) and then decreases rapidly (from several ten of 
microseconds to several hundred of microseconds). 
In order to analyze the effect of supersonic shock wave on 
systems, the accurate estimation of Pmax is mandatory [1]. For 
several setup configurations (mass of explosive, distance 
between source and sensor), the over-pressure decrease phase 
is lower than 100 µs. In these cases, sensors with response 
time lower than 1 µs are required. 
The pressure sensors commercially available and suitable 
for pyrotechnic applications, use mainly piezoelectric 
transducers with ceramic thick disk [2][3] or polymer thin film 
[4]. The typical response time of such sensors is about several 
microseconds for side-on configuration. High response times 
is mainly due to the large diameter (> 900µm), of used 
piezoelectric layers, in order to produce enough electrical 
charges. 
In order to reduce the response time, micro-membranes 
with a diameter lower than 100 µm and based on optical 
transduction have been reported in [5]-[8]. These sensors have 
good dynamic performances with frequency bandwidth often 
higher than 10 MHz. But the optical transduction requires 
complex technological steps and does not facilitate the high 
integration of multiple sensors. 
Recently, we proposed a transducer using a miniature 
monocrystalline silicon membrane and silicon piezoresistive 
gauges [9]-[10]. The objective was to combine the advantage 
of miniature membrane (sensing diameter < 100 µm) and the 
high integration of electronic transduction. In this paper, we 
report the design, fabrication and characterization of this 
transducer, and we explore the unexpected and undesirable 
mechanical response observed beyond 1 µs.  
The paper is organized as follows. The design of the 
transducer is presented in Section 2. The Section 3 is 
dedicated to the fabrication of the transducer. The simulated 
(COMSOL) static pressure response of the transducer is given 
in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 describes the dynamic pressure 
response of the sensor using a shock tube. 
II. 
TRANSDUCER DESIGN 
The topology of the transducer is displayed in Figure 1 and 
Figure 2.  
A N-type monocrystalline 5 µm thick silicon membrane is 
used for the mechanical transducer. This membrane is 
obtained by releasing the top layer of a Silicon-On-Insulator 
(SOI) substrate. Its shape is rectangular with targeted width 
WM = 30 µm and length LM = 90 µm.  
The 
electrical 
transducer 
is 
provided 
by 
P-type 
monocrystalline silicon gauges, which are inserted at the 
center of the N-type silicon membrane and are distributed 
using the Wheatstone bridge configuration. The inter-isolation 
of the gauges is obtained from the reverse polarization of the 
P/N junction. The targeted gauges width is WJ = 1 µm and 
length LJ = 5 µm. 
The pressure is applied on the top side of the membrane and a 
reference cavity with vacuum is located at the bottom side of 
the membrane.

TRANSDUCER FABRICATION 
This section describes, first of all, the different 
technological steps required for the fabrication of the 
transducer. Electrical characterization of the gauges is then 
discussed. The last part is dedicated to the measurement of 
the membrane dimensions. 
A. Technological fabrication steps 
The transducer fabrication uses SOI wafers, whose 
characteristics are given in Table 1. The transducer on its 
metallic holder is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 2. Top view of the mask used for the technological process 
 
The technological process starts with the growing of a  
40 nm thick thermal silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer. Boron and 
phosphorus implantations are then performed respectively for 
the low resistivity interconnections between gauges and 
metallic lines and for the electrical contact on SiN-top. Both 
implantations 
are 
done 
with 
the 
same 
parameters  
(Energy = 50 keV, Dose = 1016 at/cm2). The activation 
annealing of dopants is then performed during one hour at 
1000 °C. 
The next step is dedicated to the gauge’s fabrication with 
boron implantation (Energy = 20 keV, Dose = 5*1014 at/cm2). 
The activation annealing of dopants is performed with rapid 
thermal annealing during one minute at 1000 °C, in order to 
hold the dopant close to the membrane surface where the 
stress is maximal and then to maximize the transducer 
sensitivity. The surface concentration is of 3.5 1019 at/cm3, 
which consists of a good trade-off between gauge sensitivities 
to strain and temperature. The junction depth is of 0.3 µm.

(c) View of TO3 metallic holder. 
 
Next, the deposition of a 350 nm thick SiO2 layer is 
performed at 300°C by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor 
Deposition to provide enough electrical isolation between 
gauges and future metallic interconnections. After contact 
opening by liquid etching of the SiO2 layer, a 500 nm thick 
aluminum layer is deposited by thermal evaporation for 
metallic interconnections. The silicon membrane is then 
released by using a Deep Reactive Ionic Etching (DRIE) of 
Si-bulk from back-side, up to the buried-SiO2 etch-stop layer.  
After the anodic bonding of the glass substrate on the 
silicon back side, the wafer is cut and the die is glued on a 
metallic holder. Wire bonding is finally performed between 
transducer pads and holder pin. 
B. Electrical characteristics of the fabricated gauges 
The transducer resistance RTransd (between Vout1 and 
Vout2), 
measured 
before 
the 
wafer 
dicing, 
is 
of  
(2990 ± 100) Ω. This measurement result is slightly lower 
than the simulated one (3650 Ω) obtained from COMSOL 
software, using mask dimension opening of WJ = 1 µm and  
LJ = 5 µm. With these dimensions, the gauge resistance RJ is 
of 1380 Ω. The difference with the transducer resistance 
RTransd is due to the access resistance (mainly the P+ 
interconnection 
between 
the 
gauges 
and 
the 
P++ 
interconnection). 
As shown on Figure 4, the final dimensions of the 
fabricated gauge are impacted by the photoresist lateral 
under-etching dsur = (110 ± 40) nm (Figure 4-a) and also by 
the boron diffusion dlat (about 130 nm) during annealing, 
corresponding to a boron doping level of 1*1019 at/cm3 
(Figure 4-b). The final gauge width WJf and length LJf are 
respectively of 1.5 µm and 4.5 µm (equations (1) and (2)).  
 
WJf = WJ + 2*dsur + 2*dlat  
(1) 
LJf = LJ - 2*dsur - 2*dlat 
(2) 
 
Using the dimensions WJf and LJf (instead of the dimension of 
the mask opening WJ and LJ), a very good agreement is 
obtained between the simulated transducer resistance RTransd 
(3110 
Ω) 
and 
the 
measured 
resistance  
(2990 Ω ± 100 Ω).

increase due to the (a) Photoresist etching and (b) Boron diffusion. 
C. Membrane dimensions 
As shown in Figure 5, the membrane width is higher than 
the mask opening. This originates in the lateral under-etching 
of the 40 µm thick photoresist, the non-ideal vertical DRIE 
etching of silicon and finally the lateral under-etching of 
silicon related to the accumulation of chemical species, when 
the buried SiO2 layer is reached.

The dimensions of the fabricated membranes are measured 
on several samples using Focus Ion Beam (FIB) etching, for 
cross section realization, and Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(SEM), for dimensional measurements (Figure 6). The results 
obtained are given in Table 2.

The Si-top and buried SiO2 measured layers thicknesses

supplier (Table 1). The average membrane width is of  
41 µm, that is, 37 % larger than the mask width, with a 
scattering of ± 3.6 %. 
IV. 
SIMULATED RESPONSE OF THE TRANSDUCER TO 
STATIC PRESSURE 
COMSOL simulations were performed to predict the 
static transducer performances. The full design was 
considered (Figure 1 and Figure 2) with two membrane 
dimensions corresponding to the lowest and the highest 
mechanical stiffness given by the measured membrane 
dimensions (see Table 2). The static pressure sensitivity and 
the fundamental mechanical resonant frequency are reported 
in Table 3.

transducer sensitivity is then of ± 20.5 %. 
The simulated fundamental mechanical resonant frequency

the

to

V. 
SHOCK TUBE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE 
FABRICATED SENSOR 
This section describes, first of all, the setup used for the 
dynamic pressure characterization of the fabricated sensor. 
Then the sensor response, to a pressure step, is given. The last 
part analyses the sensor drift; that appears after 1 µs. 
A. Setup description 
The setup used for the dynamic pressure characterization 
of the sensor is illustrated on Figure 7. 
A 2.7 m length and 11 cm inner-diameter metrological shock 
tube allows generating a pressure step with a rise time lower 
than 10 ns. The driver section is filled with nitrogen gas, 
while the driven section is at atmospheric pressure. The 
diaphragm, which separates the two sections, is a standard 
nickel rupture disc that opens fully and responds within 
milliseconds to the applied overpressure. Its rupture creates a 
shock wave that propagates along the tube until reflections by 
the metallic end-wall of the tube, where the pressure is 
measured both by our transducer and by using a commercial 
reference sensor (PCB Piezotronics 134A24) for comparison 
purpose.

Figure 7. Experimental setup for dynamic pressure characterization 
 
The transducer output is connected to a conditioning 
circuit through a length (10 cm) of shielded wires. The static 
gain of this circuit is of 0.9, with a cut-of frequency of  
35 MHz. The sampling frequency of the data acquisition 
system is of 100 MHz. 
B. Measured sensor response to a pressure step 
The measured sensor response (at the output of the 
conditioning circuit) to a 10 bar pressure step is shown in 
Figure 8. 
A typical damped oscillation is obtained in the first micro-
second due to the excitation of the fundamental mechanical 
resonant mode of the membrane. From this measurement 
result, we can derive the main transducer characteristics: the 
rise time of 30 ns, the response time lower than 1 µs and the 
steady-state pressure sensitivity around 200 µV/V/bar 
(assuming a gain of 0.9 from the conditioning circuit). This 
sensitivity is then in good agreement with the simulated 
value. 
The fundamental resonant frequency of 20.4 MHz is also in 
good agreement with the simulated value, as shown in  
Figure 9, which displays the spectral analysis of the measured 
sensor response. But beyond 1 µs, we observe that an 
unexpected drift appears. The next section is devoted to the 
interpretation of this drift.

Configuration C2: Without membrane - Without Cover 
Configuration C3: With membrane - With Cover 
Configuration C4: With membrane - Without Cover 
 
In configuration C1, the Si-Bulk is not removed below the 
gauges and a metallic cover is used to avoid direct shock wave 
effect (blue color). In this configuration, only indirect strain is 
applied on the gauges, without the membrane amplification. 
A slow variation of the sensor response is observed, with an 
amplitude of ± 5mV. 
The same transducer is used in the configuration C2, but 
without the metallic cover (orange color). Compared with 
configuration C1, the sensor response is not significantly 
modified, but a higher amplitude (± 10mV) is observed due to 
the direct impact of the shock wave under the gauge and/or 
the mechanical stiffening of the metallic holder by the metallic 
cover. 
In the configuration C3, the response of a transducer with 
a membrane and a metallic cover is measured (red color). The 
large undesirable effect observed in the response (around 3 
times of one recorded in the configuration C1) can be 
explained by the mechanical deformations of the metallic 
holder, which are transmitted to the membrane and then 
amplified. 
Finally, the same transducer used in the configuration C3 
is measured in configuration C4, but without the metallic 
cover (black color). As expected, the membrane response is 
apparent in the first micro-seconds, and consequently, the 
drift occurs. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
The characterization of supersonic shock wave produced 
by explosives requires sensor with response time lower than 
1 µs in order to quantify accurately the maximum 
overpressure in several side-on configurations. With sensing 
diameter greater than 900 µm, the commercial sensors are not 
able to fulfill this specification. Researches are focused on 
miniature membranes (diameter < 100 µm), but they very 
often applied an optical transduction, which requires complex 
technological steps and are not compatible with the 
integration of several transducers on the same chip. 
We proposed here a pressure transducer using a miniature 
silicon membrane and piezoresistive gauges in order to 
combine the advantage of miniature sensing area and 
microelectronic integration. A miniature piezoresistive 
pressure sensor was designed, fabricated and characterized 
within a shock tube. The proposed sensor has a very low rise 
time (about 30 ns) and a short response time (about 1 µs), 
thanks to the high fundamental mechanical resonant mode of 
the membrane (close to 20 MHz). Mechanical parasitic 
effects, that leads to large drift after few microseconds, were 
explored and identified. This effect was interpreted as the 
result of the metallic holder deformation due to the shock 
wave. New packaging with higher mechanical stiffness will 
be designed in order to reduce these undesirable effects in the 
pressure response of the transducer.
