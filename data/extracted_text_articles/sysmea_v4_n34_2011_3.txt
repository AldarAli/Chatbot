Abstract—This paper discusses the reconstruction quality of
spatio-temporal congested freeway trafﬁc patterns depending
on the information provided by different equipment rates of
probe vehicles. In this research Kerner’s three-phase trafﬁc
theory is applied, which distinguishes two different phases in
congested trafﬁc: synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jam.
In the presented approach spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc
patterns are reconstructed from intelligent probe vehicle in-
formation generated by an on-board trafﬁc state detection,
identifying trafﬁc states along a vehicle’s trajectory at any time.
With a data fusion algorithm combining the data of several
probe vehicles, a detailed picture of spatio-temporal congested
trafﬁc patterns is revealed. Comparing Ground-Truth with
the reconstructed trafﬁc pattern shows that a reconstruction
quality comparable to that of established trafﬁc ﬂow models is
achievable with probe vehicle equipment rates of about 0.5 %.
At higher equipment rates of about 1-1.5 % the achievable
quality already exceeds the quality established trafﬁc ﬂow
models are able to offer based on a dense detector network
with average detector distances of 1-2 km.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, congested trafﬁc on highways is still a major
problem with severe implications for personal life and the
economy. In recent years, congested trafﬁc data was mostly
gathered with stationary loop detectors. It is expensive to
equip a road network with detectors of high quality and
small detector distance. Recent progress in mobile communi-
cation technology, like WLAN and 3G/UMTS, allows trafﬁc
data to be gathered by probe vehicles. In this research the
question is answered how many probe vehicles are needed
to deliver a quality of trafﬁc data comparable to a dense
high quality detector network.
In order to assess the quality of reconstructed trafﬁc
patterns, three different quality indices are introduced and
assessed. In [16] some basic results have been already
presented for the quality index for travel time and the
quality index for regions of synchronized ﬂow and wide
moving jams. The quality index for fronts of synchronized
ﬂow and wide moving jams has been brieﬂy introduced
but not evaluated. The other two quality indices have been
evaluated based on a congested trafﬁc situation representing
a general pattern (GP) according to Kerner’s Three Phase
Trafﬁc Theory. General patterns occur when there is just
a single effective bottleneck. Hence the emerging spatio-
temporal patterns are fairly simple.
In this research based on [16] a more detailed assessment
of the reconstruction quality is conducted based on an
extended trafﬁc situation. The examined situation represents
an expanded pattern (EP) according to Kerner’s Three Phase
Trafﬁc Theory. In this situation trafﬁc patterns emerging at
several adjacent effective bottlenecks are overlapping. Hence
the resulting combined spatio-temporal trafﬁc patterns show
a very complex structure and dynamics. In addition, for
the ﬁrst time, a thorough assessment of the quality index
for fronts of synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jams is
presented. This allows a detailed discussion of the achievable
quality of probe vehicle based models in comparison to
stationary loop detector based systems. This research takes
all quality aspects of spatio-temporal congested freeway
patterns, covered by the three three presented quality indices,
into consideration.
OUTLINE
The paper starts with a brief introduction to Kerner’s
Three Phase Trafﬁc Theory. Basic elements as well spatio-
temporal trafﬁc patterns are explained. The trafﬁc models
ASDA (Automatische Staudynamikanalyse; automatic con-
gestion analysis) and FOTO (Forecasting of Trafﬁc Objects)
based on this theory are described. They reconstruct con-
gested trafﬁc patterns from data measured by stationary loop
detectors.
After that the impact of spatio-temporal trafﬁc pattern on
vehicles moving through these patterns is discussed.
New methods, which allow the reconstruction of spatio-
temporal trafﬁc patterns from data measured by probe ve-
hicles, are brieﬂy introduced. This approach allows a high
quality reconstruction of trafﬁc patterns in the whole trafﬁc
network without having to rely on stationary loop detectors.

Then three quality indices are introduced and discussed
in detail. This includes quality indices for (i) travel time,
(ii) fronts of synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jams as
well as (iii) regions of synchronized ﬂow and wide moving
jams. These quality indices allow the assessment of the
reconstruction quality on spatio-temporal trafﬁc patterns.
An approach to the simulation of a realistic test dataset is
presented.
Based on this dataset and the presented quality indices,
the reconstruction quality of the new methods is compared
to the reconstruction quality of the trafﬁc models ASDA and
FOTO.
II. KERNER’S THREE PHASE TRAFFIC THEORY
Based on extensive trafﬁc data analyses of available
stationary detector measurements spanning several years
Kerner discovered that in addition to free ﬂow (F) two
different trafﬁc phases must be differentiated in congested
freeway trafﬁc: synchronized ﬂow (S) and wide moving jam
(J) ([5], [8]).
A. Elements of Three Phase Trafﬁc Theory
Empirical macroscopic spatio-temporal objective criteria
for trafﬁc phases as elements of Kerner’s three-phase trafﬁc
theory ([5], [8]) are as follows:
1) A wide moving jam is a moving jam that maintains
the mean velocity of the downstream jam front, even
when the jam propagates through any other trafﬁc state
or freeway bottleneck.
2) In contrast, the downstream front of the synchronized
ﬂow phase is often ﬁxed at a freeway bottleneck
and does not show the characteristic features of wide
moving jams.
Figure 1.
Explanation of trafﬁc phase deﬁnitions from empirical data:
Spatio-temporal overview of speed (left) and ﬂow rate of trafﬁc (right) on
a selected freeway section
However, neither the observation of speed synchronization
in congested trafﬁc nor other relationships and features
of congested trafﬁc measured at speciﬁc freeway locations
(e.g., in the ﬂow-density plane) are a criterion for the
phase differentiation. The clear differentiation between the
synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jam phases can be made
on the above objective criteria 1) and 2) only.
Figure 1 illustrates a vehicle speed and ﬂow proﬁle over
time and space based upon real measured trafﬁc data. A
wide moving jam propagates upstream as a low speed valley
through the freeway stretch. In contrast, a second speed
valley is ﬁxed at the bottleneck location: this congested
trafﬁc phase belongs to the synchronized ﬂow phase.
B. Spatio-Temporal Congested Trafﬁc Patterns
The distribution of trafﬁc phases over time and space on
a road represents a spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc pattern.
Kerner’s three-phase trafﬁc theory is able to explain all
empirically measured trafﬁc patterns on various roads in
many different countries ([19], [20]).
C. Models ASDA and FOTO
For recognition, tracking and prediction of the spatio-
temporal congested trafﬁc patterns, based on stationary loop
detectors, the models ASDA and FOTO ([5], [8]) have been
proposed by Kerner based on the key elements of the theory.
Nowadays, the models ASDA and FOTO are deployed in the
federal state of Hessen and in the free state of Bavaria where
they perform online processing of data [9]. In addition they
have been successfully used in a laboratory environment on
the M42 near Birmingham, UK and the I-405 in California,
USA (Figure 2). In recent years other models, which are
similar to the models ASDA and FOTO, have also been
published [22].
III. IMPACTS FOR VEHICLES AND VEHICULAR
ASSISTANCE APPLICATION
Vehicles driving through a spatio-temporal congested traf-
ﬁc pattern experience a number of trafﬁc state changes. A
trafﬁc state change represents a unique and exact position
in time and space where the trafﬁc phase changes, e.g.,
from free ﬂow to wide moving jam. It is experienced at any
position, where a vehicle hits the upstream or downstream
front of a region of a trafﬁc phase. In contrast a trafﬁc
phase transition represents the start point or the end point,
respectively, of a trafﬁc phase and occurs only twice for each
region of a trafﬁc phase (see Figure 3).
Trafﬁc state changes between the different trafﬁc phases
have impacts of different strength on the vehicle and vehicu-
lar assistance applications [2]. Two of the most distinguish-
ing parameters of different trafﬁc phases from a vehicle’s
perspective are the vehicle speed v and the vehicle density
ρ. Both parameters inﬂuence the ability of the vehicles to
choose their driving speed as well as the possibility for them
to overtake other vehicles and to freely choose their driving
lane. Different trafﬁc state changes have a different effect on
the value of these parameters. Table I and Table II show the
expected changes for the possible speed v and the vehicle
density ρ, respectively.

Vehicular assistance applications, like adaptive cruise
control or hybrid engine control depend on and beneﬁt
from the knowledge of the current and in some cases
future values of these parameters ([7], [11]). Each trafﬁc
state change represents a control and parameter adaption
point for these applications. The better the reconstruction of
the spatio-temporal structure of congested trafﬁc patterns,
the better the knowledge about current and future spatio-
temporal positions of trafﬁc state changes and hence the
higher the potential of improving the open- and closed-
loop control of vehicular assistance applications. Having a
high quality knowledge about current and future trafﬁc state
changes opens the door for a complete new class of vehicular
assistance applications:
• Safety related systems: Vehicular assistance applica-
tions, which improve vehicle safety by being aware of
sudden speed breakdowns on the path of a vehicle, for
example caused by trafﬁc state changes from phase F
to phase J.
• Energy efﬁcient systems: Vehicular assistance applica-
tions, which improve the energy efﬁciency of vehicles
by reducing fuel consumption by being aware of current
and future trafﬁc states.
In addition a high quality reconstruction of spatio-
temporal trafﬁc patterns allows the application of existing
vehicular assistance applications in better quality. For ex-
ample a better knowledge of the travel time loss caused
by spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc patterns improves the
quality of existing dynamic route guidance systems.
IV. RECONSTRUCTION OF SPATIO-TEMPORAL
CONGESTED TRAFFIC PATTERNS
A. Trafﬁc State Detection in Autonomous Vehicle
Instead of stationary loop detectors, probe vehicle data
is used for the detection and reconstruction of spatio-
temporal congested trafﬁc patterns. Many systems using
probes transmit only aggregated travel times for pre-deﬁned
road sections [4]. Here, we are not only interested in the
travel time losses caused by spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc
patterns, but also in their detailed structure (Figure 3, [5],
[8]).
In Kerner’s three-phase trafﬁc theory there is one phase of
free ﬂow (F) and two phases of congested trafﬁc, synchro-
nized ﬂow (S) and wide moving jam (J). Each trafﬁc pattern
consists of a unique formation and behavior of regions in

time and space belonging to exactly one of these three
phases. One of these three phases is assigned to each of
the probe positions in time and space in an autonomous
way ([6], [8]). A trafﬁc state change is performed when
the chosen measured values are above or below speciﬁc
thresholds in speed and time, which are chosen according
to on-board trafﬁc criteria [10].
B. Cooperative Reconstruction of Trafﬁc Patterns
For the reconstruction of spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc
patterns a clustering algorithm is employed. First, the trafﬁc
phase is identiﬁed, then depending on the identiﬁed trafﬁc
phase, an algorithm tailored for the speciﬁc characteristic
features of the synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jam
trafﬁc phases is applied [17] (Figure 5).

V. RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY INDICES
The reconstruction quality of spatio-temporal congested
trafﬁc patterns can only be assessed in the case that the
real spatio-temporal trafﬁc pattern is known. Full knowledge
about spatio-temporal trafﬁc patterns is only possible, when
the positions of all vehicles participating in trafﬁc ﬂow
are known for any time instant. This is still difﬁcult to
achieve, even with the recent advances in trafﬁc measure-
ment technology. Hence any measured trafﬁc pattern, which
represents the best-known information about a real trafﬁc
pattern, exhibits some deviation to reality. The best known
trafﬁc information is called Ground-Truth. Therefore, when
the quality of reconstructed spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc
patterns is assessed by comparing them to any measured
Ground-Truth information about this patterns, it is only
possible to assess their error compared to Ground-Truth, but
not their deviation to reality.
In the following sections a formal deﬁnition of spatio-
temporal congested trafﬁc patterns is introduced. Based on
this deﬁnition, three different quality indices are presented:
a quality index for travel time, a quality index for fronts
of synchronized ﬂow and wide moving jam and a quality
index for regions of synchronized ﬂow and wide moving
jam. Each of the quality indices assesses a different feature
of spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc patterns.
A. Formal Deﬁnition of Trafﬁc Patterns
In a continuous trafﬁc reality a trafﬁc state TS is assigned
to each spatio-temporal position P(x, t), whereas x repre-
sents a continuous value in distance and t a continuous value
in time. The trafﬁc reality R represents the combination of
all
TS(x, t) ∈ {F, S, J}
(1)
within the spatial borders xs and xe as well as the
temporal borders and ts and te, hence
R := {TS(x, t)|xs ≤ x ≤ xe ∧ ts ≤ t ≤ te}
(2)
Compared to R a reconstruction of trafﬁc patterns using a
model M in most cases shows deviations in time and space.
The quality Q of the reconstruction is given by the deviation
D between M and R. Hence
M := {TS(x, t)|xs ≤ x ≤ xe ∧ ts ≤ t ≤ te}
(3)
Q = DM→R
(4)
As mentioned above, currently it is difﬁcult to measure
trafﬁc reality. In addition storing and processing continuous
spatio-temporal information is not feasible. For example,
when stationary loop detectors are used to measure trafﬁc
reality, the continuous values of time and distance are
actually measured as discrete values. These values average
time and distance in discrete intervals.
Consequently, x and t degrade to the discrete values xd
and td. Their resolution represents the quality of knowledge
about the spatio-temporal information. In common systems
using stationary loop detectors the temporal resolution is in
most cases td = 1 min, while the spatial resolution is in the
best case xd = 1−2 km. In many cases the spatial resolution
is even lower. This means that the trafﬁc reality is known
with even less quality.

Discretization of spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc patterns
Using xd and td the continuous trafﬁc reality R becomes
the discrete trafﬁc reality Rd as shown in Figure 6. By
taking the border spatial borders xs and xe and the temporal
borders ts and te into account, Rd represent information
about a trafﬁc pattern TPRd within some spatio-temporal
boundary:
TPRd := {TSd(x, t)|xs ≤ x0, x1...xn ≤ xe
∧ts ≤ t0, t1...tn ≤ te}
(5)
In order to determine the discrete quality Qd, a discrete
model output Md with the same spatial and temporal res-
olutions xd and td is required. This model represents the
reconstructed trafﬁc pattern TPM:
TPM := {TSd(x, t)|xs ≤ x0, x1...xn ≤ xe
∧ts ≤ t0, t1...tn ≤ te}
(6)
For Qd this leads to
Qd = DT PM→T PRd
(7)
B. Quality Index for Travel Time
For each point in time t the total travel time Ttotal
consisting of free ﬂow travel time and congested travel time
can be calculated as shown in [18]
Ttotal(t) = LF (t)
vF (t) + LJ(t)
vJ(t) + LS(t)
vS(t)
(8)
where LF (t), LS(t) and LJ(t) represent the lengths of
the trafﬁc phases and vF (t), vS(t) and vJ(t) represent the
average speeds within these phases at time t.
The travel time Ttotal(t) can be determined for road
segment based on a reconstructed trafﬁc pattern TPM and
based on a trafﬁc pattern TPRd, which has been deﬁned
as Ground-Truth. In this case the travel time through the
reconstructed trafﬁc pattern is represented by TM and the
travel time through Ground-Truth is deﬁned as TGT . By
calculating the relative average deviation ∆T between TM
and TGT , is is possible to assess the quality index for travel
time for a given spatio-temporal region [14]. The assessment
takes spatio-temporal regions between the spatial border xs
and xe on N time instants between the temporal boundaries
ts and te into account:
∆T = 1
N
te
X
t=ts
|TM(t) − TGT (t)|

(9)
The quality index given by (9) is represented by a number
∆T ≥ 0. A result of ∆T = 0 represents the best possible
quality, which is achieved, when TM and TGT are the same
for all time instants t.
C. Quality Index for Fronts of S and J
Positions of phase fronts of the trafﬁc phases S and J
are denoted by xup(t) and xdown(t) for each time instant t.
Hence, expanded spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc patterns
can show several phase fronts at a given time t. Phase fronts
can be reconstructed based on a reconstructed trafﬁc pattern
TPM or based on a trafﬁc pattern TPRd, which has been
deﬁned as Ground-Truth. For each time t and each phase
the positions of the upstream front are deﬁned as xP hase
upM (t)
and xP hase
upGT (t), while the positions of the downstream front
are designated as xP hase
downM (t) and xP hase
downGT (t), respectively.
The reconstruction quality of each single phase front is de-
termined by the relative average deviation of both positions
at N time instants between the temporal boundaries ts und
te.
The quality of an upstream phase front is given by ∆P hase
up
∆P hase

down :

(11)
Both quality indices give as a result the relative average
deviation in meters between a reconstructed phase front and
a phase front, which has been deﬁned as Ground-Truth.
Hence ∆P hase
up
≥ 0 m and ∆P hase
down ≥ 0 m. The best quality
is achieved, when both phase fronts are the same. This is
represented by ∆P hase
up
= 0 m and ∆P hase
down = 0 m.
Within a trafﬁc pattern, which has been deﬁned as
Ground-Truth, a phase front occurs on N(GT) time instant
between the temporal borders ts and te. In this period a
single phase front shows no gaps. If it would be the case it
would not be a single phase front, but instead several phase

fronts. Hence, in addition to the reconstruction quality of
a phase front, its coverage is assessed. Coverage is deﬁned
as the ratio of N(M) time instants where the phase front
was reconstructed by a model with respect to N(GT) time
instants where the phase front was present in Ground-Truth.
This leads to two addition quality indices, which measure
the coverage of both the upstream and downstream phase
fronts.
The coverage of the upstream phase front is given by
CP hase
up
CP hase
up

(12)
while CP hase
down gives the coverage of the downstream phase
front:
CP hase
down = N P hase
down (M)
N P hase
down (GT)
(13)
Both CP hase
up
and CP hase
down
give a result between 0 and 1,
describing the coverage of a Ground-Truth phase front by a
reconstructed one. Best coverage is achieved by CP hase
up
= 1
and CP hase
down = 1.
All quality indices for phase fronts emphasize some spe-
ciﬁc aspects of a spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc pattern.
They assess the quality of the reconstruction of a speciﬁc
phase fronts, hence they do not represent a quality index for
all phase fronts of a trafﬁc pattern.
D. Quality Index for Regions of S and J
The quality index for regions of S and J assesses the
general reconstruction quality between a trafﬁc pattern TPM
reconstructed by a model M and trafﬁc pattern TPGT , which
has been deﬁned as the Ground-Truth reference information.
For each congested trafﬁc phase the spatio-temporal areas
they cover are compared against each other with regard
to hits and false alarms. Figure 7 illustrates this concept,
representing an adaption of the ROC1-analysis for trafﬁc
data. The origin of ROC-analysis is medical diagnostics [23].
Since a few years its concepts have also been applied to
machine learning [24].
The ROC-analysis is previously been applied for assessing
the quality of trafﬁc data [1]. However, in this case only the
classes congested and not congested have been considered
[12]. In [16], the ROC-analysis was extended and applied to
trafﬁc data containing three distinct trafﬁc phases.
The deﬁnitions of TPM and TPRd given in the previous
section can directly be applied to yield a computationally
efﬁcient calculation of this quality index. The Ground-Truth
reference information use for quality assessment is deﬁned
as TPGT . For both TPM and TPGT three binary matrices
are calculated, one for each trafﬁc phase. These matrices

Deﬁnition of the Quality Index for Regions of Synchronized

positions.

TPGT to TP F

row vector rv and a column vector cv with correct dimension
for TPM and TPGT with all aij = 1 allows to count the
number c of elements aij within matrix A where aij = 1.
c = rv ∗ A ∗ cv
(14)
The reconstruction quality of spatio-temporal trafﬁc pat-
terns can now be assessed based on ROC-analysis [3] using
the ROC measure TPR (true-positive-rate),
TPR =
tp
tp + fn
(15)
the measure FPR (false-positive-rate)
FPR =
fp
tn + fp
(16)
and ﬁnally the measure FAR (false alarm rate)
FAR =
fp
tp + fp
(17)
whereas tp represents the true-positives, fp the false-
positives, tn the true-negatives and fn the false-negatives.
Figure 8 shows this for a feature space having the features
A and B, where the classiﬁcation of a class G is performed
by a classiﬁcator C.
This leads to different deﬁnitions of tp, fp, tn, fn and
TPR, FPR and FAR for both congested trafﬁc phases S
and J.
1) Trafﬁc phase S: For synchronized ﬂow S the classiﬁ-
cation of a trafﬁc state TS at a position Pd results in the
following different cases according to ROC deﬁnitions:
1) True positive tp: TSM = S ∧ TSGT = S
2) False positive fp: TSM = S ∧(TSGT = J ∨TSGT =
F)
3) True negative fn: (TSM = J∨TSM = F)∧(TSGT =
J ∨ TSGT = F)

Taking these deﬁnitions into account, the corresponding
values for TPRS, FPRS and FARS are calculated as
follows:
TPRS = zv ∗ (TP S
M ∧ TP S
GT ) ∗ sv
zv ∗ TP S

FARS = zv ∗ (TP S

M ∧ TP F
GT ) ∗ sv
zv ∗ TP S
M ∗ sv
(20)
All quality indices TPRS, FPRS and FARS give values
between 0 and 1.
The index TPRS describes the ratio of TPGT , which is
covered by TPM. A value of TPRS = 1 corresponds to
the best possible quality. In this case TPGT is completely
covered by TPM. The worst possible quality is represented
by TPRS = 1, when the reconstructed trafﬁc pattern does
not cover any region of the real trafﬁc pattern.
In contrast to TPRS, the index FPRS describes the ratio
of TPGT , which is by mistake classiﬁed as trafﬁc phase S.
Hence the best possible quality corresponds to FPRS = 0,
while the worst possible quality corresponds to FPRS = 1.
Finally, the false alarm rate FARS describes the ratio of
TPM, which by mistake classiﬁes the trafﬁc phase S. The
best possible quality corresponds to FARS = 0, while the
worst possible quality corresponds to FARS = 1.
The special case TPRS = 1, FPRS = 0 and FARS = 0
represents the best possible quality, when all three indices
are taken into account. In this case TPM and TPGT are
completely congruent, the trafﬁc pattern reconstructed by
the model is in accordance to real trafﬁc pattern.
2) Trafﬁc phase J: For the trafﬁc phase wide moving jam
J the classiﬁcation of a trafﬁc state TS at a position Pd
results in the following possible cases:
1) True positive rp: ZM = J ∧ ZGT = J
2) False positive fp: ZM = J ∧ (ZGT = S ∨ ZGT = F)
3) True negative fn: (ZM = S ∨ ZM = F) ∧ (ZGT =
S ∨ ZGT = F)
4) False negative rn: (ZM = S ∨ ZM = F) ∧ ZGT = J
The corresponding values for TPRJ, FPRJ and FARJ
are calculated as follows:
TPRJ = zv ∗ (TP J
M ∧ TP J
GT ) ∗ sv
zv ∗ TP J
GT ∗ sv
(21)
FPRJ = zv ∗ (TP J
M ∧ TP S
GT + TP J
M ∧ TP F
GT ) ∗ sv
zv ∗ (TP S

(22)
FARJ = zv ∗ (TP J
M ∧ TP S
GT + TP J
M ∧ TP F
GT ) ∗ sv
zv ∗ TP J
M ∗ sv
(23)
Again TPRJ, FPRJ and FARJ give all values between
0 and 1. Regarding maximum and minimum quality they
behave like their counterparts for the trafﬁc phase S.

The maximum quality of the coverage C is full coverage
C = 1, while the minimum quality is represented by no
coverage C = 0.
The indices TPR, FPR and FAR have their maximum
quality at a maximum of correct classiﬁcations and a min-
imum of false classiﬁcations. Hence the maximum quality
is represented by TPR = 1, FPR = 0 and FAR = 0,
while the minimum quality is represented by TPR = 0,
FPR = 1 and FAR = 1.
VI. TEST ENVIRONMENT
The Kerner-Klenov microscopic three-phase trafﬁc model
([5], [8]) has been used for the generation of a large number
of single vehicle trajectories. As input data for the model a
description of the simulated track as well as initial starting
conditions of speed and ﬂow at the most upstream border are
required. All other areas in space and time are governed by
the Kerner-Klenov model. The microscopic model’s output
can be regarded as a realization of Ground-Truth, which is
qualitatively comparable to spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc
patterns measured on highways ([5], [8]).
Ground-Truth denotes in this context that the model out-
put represents the reference information or the reality, which
should be reconstructed by a trafﬁc model using the vehicle
trajectories as base data. Quality is therefore measured as
the difference between Ground-Truth and the cooperative
reconstruction of spatio-temporal congested trafﬁc patterns
based on the generated trajectories.
First, a trafﬁc state detection is performed in each virtual
vehicle, in order to detect all trafﬁc state changes this virtual
vehicle experiences. After that all trafﬁc state changes are
combined to a reconstructed congested trafﬁc pattern by ap-
plying a clustering algorithm. It combines the autonomously
detected trafﬁc state changes of several probe vehicles to a
collective and cooperatively reconstructed trafﬁc pattern (see
Figure 9).

VII. RESULTS
A. Examined Situation
For evaluation the Kerner-Klenov three-phase microscopic
model was used to simulate an expanded spatio-temporal
congested trafﬁc pattern. The simulation was conﬁgured to
simulate a 30 km highway stretch with three lanes and three
junctions containing on- and off-ramps. The incoming and
outgoing ﬂow at these three junctions leads to the realization
of three bottlenecks, which could lead to an F
→ S
trafﬁc breakdown and the formation of several regions of
synchronized ﬂow. Within the synchronized ﬂow regions
several wide moving jams emerged (Figure 10).

three ﬁgures as stable structures moving upstream with a constant speed.
In contrast the downstream front of the trafﬁc phase synchronized ﬂow is
stationary ﬁxed at the location of the bottlenecks.
In the following sections, the quality index results of
model using probe vehicle data are compared with the results
of the ASDA and FOTO models based on stationary loop

detector data. In order to achieve this, the simulated situation
was reconstructed by both the model using probe vehicle
data and the ASDA and FOTO models using different
conﬁgurations of input data. Then the achievable quality was
assessed by using the quality indices introduced earlier in
this paper.
The models ASDA and FOTO were used with different
detector conﬁgurations. The average distance ranged be-
tween about 1 km until up to up 9 km. Results of the models
ASDA and FOTO with two different detector conﬁgurations
are shown in Figure 11.

The trafﬁc models based on probe vehicle data were used
with different equipment rates of probe vehicles ranging
between 4 % and 0.25 %. Results of the vehicles based
models are shown in Figure 12. Each assessed equipment
rate was examined based on 100 random distributions of
this equipment rate. Each random distribution of a given
equipment rate was selected from all vehicles, which are
part of the trafﬁc ﬂow. Each selected random distribution
represents one possible realization of this equipment rate.
By comparing the results of all random distributions of one
equipment rate, the inﬂuence of different realizations on the
achievable results at a given equipment rate can be derived.

compared to the ADSD/FOTO models. At a equipment rate
of about 1 % the achievable results are comparable to a high
quality detector network having an average detector distance
of 1-2 km.
C. Quality Index for Fronts of Synchronized Flow and Wide
Moving Jam
The results of both models were also compared using
the quality index for fronts of synchronized ﬂow and wide
moving jam. At ﬁrst the deviation of fronts depending on
the input data were examined. Figure 15 shows the results
for the models ASDA and FOTO, while Figure 16 shows the
results for the models based on probe vehicle data. For both
examined jams the models based on probe vehicle data show
superior results. At the best detector conﬁguration having an
average detector distance of only 1 km the ASDA and FOTO
models achieve a front deviation of about 200 m for both
jams. This increases up to 300 - 800 m when the average
detector distance increases up to over 9 km. The models
based on probe vehicle data achieve a front deviation of at
most 200 m down to a equipment rate of only 0.5 %. At
higher equipment rates the front deviation is even smaller.
This corresponds to an even better quality.
After that the front coverage was examined for both
models. Figure 17 shows the results for the ASDA and
FOTO models. In Figure 18, the results for the models based
on probe vehicle data are shown. The quality index for front
coverage shows comparable results: the models based on
probe vehicle data are superior to the models ASDA and
FOTO. Even at an equipment rate of only 1 % the results
of the vehicle based models are comparable to ASDA and
FOTO used with an average detector distance of only 1 km.
D. Quality Index for Regions of Synchronized Flow and
Wide Moving Jam
Finally, the results of both models are assessed using the
quality index for regions of synchronized ﬂow and wide
moving jam. Figure 19 shows the results for the ASDA
and FOTO models, while Figure 20 shows the results for

the models based on probe vehicle data. Again the models
based on probe vehicle data are superior to the ASDA
and FOTO models. At an equipment rate of about 1-1.5
% the results are comparable to a dense detector network
with an average detector distance of 1 km. In addition the
false alarm rates are very low for all examined equipment
rates. In comparison the models ASDA and FOTO show an
increasing false alarm rate as the detector distance increases.
In addition the results of both models can be compared
directly, when both of them are plotted as a ROC curve in the
ROC space. In this case TPR is plotted over FPR. A ran-
dom decision is represented by the line TPR = FPR. All
results above this line are better than the random decision, all
results below this line are worse than the random decision.
The maximum quality in the ROC space is represented by
the point TPR = 1 and FPR = 0. Figure 21 shows
the results of both models in the ROC space. These results
underline the previously discussed results. The probe vehicle
based methods offer higher hit rates combined with lower
false alarm rate. This leads to an overall better quality. The
reconstruction quality is much better for the trafﬁc phase J
when compared to the trafﬁc phase S. The reason for this is
the stable upstream propagation of the trafﬁc phase J, which
allows a high quality prediction of the future movement of
the trafﬁc phase and thus a high quality reconstruction of

E. Application for Empirical Data of Moving Probe Vehicles
The results shown above have been achieved using sim-
ulated trafﬁc data. A cooperation with TomTom gave the
authors the opportunity to check the methods and results
with real-world data from a chosen trafﬁc situation [21]. This
real trafﬁc situation is a congested situation on the freeway
A5 in Germany on the 10th December, 2009. The situation
is similar to the simulated example from Figure 10.

based on real probe vehicle data is presented.
The following Figure 23 presents an empirical comparison
for the same trafﬁc situation based on different measurement
techniques and data processing methods. At the top the
results of the ASDA and FOTO models for the measured
detector data and at the bottom the congested pattern based
on TomTom probe vehicle data and reconstructed with
vehicle based methods. The results prove that based on an
equipment rate of approximately η ≈ 1% the possible data
reconstruction quality is in the order of the ASDA and FOTO
models for average detector distances of ≈ 1 km.
Qualitatively a good correlation of both congested trafﬁc
phase regions S and J can be identiﬁed. Between the
positions 0 km and 5 km the pattern reconstructed from
probe vehicle data (Figure 23 b)) shows smaller regions of
the trafﬁc phase S, which do not exist in the ASDA and
FOTO reconstructed pattern (Figure 23 a)). At the location
between 0-5 km the detectors are more sparse than at other
sections of the freeway and the trafﬁc phase S, therefore, can
be detected and reconstructed less precise in the ASDA and
FOTO models. Those congested regions can been identiﬁed
only with probe vehicle data based reconstruction methods.
Overall, in this real-world case study the processing of
different raw trafﬁc data sources with different reconstruction
methods has led to comparable results.
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Probe vehicle equipment rates of about 1-1.5 % processed
with the proposed method are comparable to detectors with
distances of 1-2 km processed with the existing ASDA and
FOTO models. In addition, the proposed method promises
the provision of high quality trafﬁc data on all highways
while existing systems rely on stationary loop detectors.
Higher probe vehicle equipment rates promise an even
higher quality trafﬁc data suitable for future ITS and ve-
hicular assistance applications. It should be noted, that this
1-1.5 % of vehicle data has been processed optimally,
i.e., without data failures and without additional latencies
of communication channels. A real-world case of trafﬁc

index of travel time is relevant for routing applications, while
applications controlling an hybrid engine would beneﬁt from
good results in the quality index for fronts of synchronized
ﬂow and wide moving jam. Future research has to answer the
important question about the performance of speciﬁc vehic-
ular assistance applications on the reconstruction quality of
congested trafﬁc patterns. This might include the deﬁnition
of additional quality indices, which are tailored to the re-
quirements of speciﬁc vehicular assistance applications. For
example the reconstruction quality of trafﬁc state changes
from F to J could be more important to some applications
than trafﬁc state changes from F to S. An additional quality
could take these differences into account.
Another relevant ﬁeld for future research is the evaluation
of system communication and system architecture alterna-
tives. Different system architectures, like for example central
server based systems and fully distributed systems using
only communicating vehicles, have different advantages and
disadvantages, when it comes to the overall system perfor-
mance in comparison to the investment needed to establish
and maintain these system architectures.
