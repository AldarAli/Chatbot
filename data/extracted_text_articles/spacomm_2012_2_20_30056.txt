Abstract—In this paper, a dual-hop cooperative diversity 
land mobile satellite system (LMSS) respectively adopted 
amplify-and-forward (AF), decode-and-forward (DF), and coded 
cooperation (CC) relaying protocols is proposed, and the outage 
probability behaviors of the three protocols have been analyzed. 
We use the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of each path to derive the 
closed-form expressions of outage probability for each protocol. 
The 
accurately 
approximated 
expressions 
in 
favor 
of 
computation simplicity have also been derived applying 
trapezoidal integration. The Monte Carlo simulations show good 
match with the proposed analytical results under different 
shadowing environments, showing that CC is the best strategy for 
low terminal transmitting SNR. For high transmitting SNR, AF 
protocol outperforms the high cooperation level CC and DF, 
while the low cooperation level CC turns out to be better than the 
other two protocols.

 INTRODUCTION 
The success of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) 
technology in terrestrial systems enormously stimulates the 
intensive 
research 
on 
its 
application 
in 
satellite 
communications [1]. In the new generation of satellite systems 
with strictly restricted available spectrum and power, high 
transmission speed and spectral efficiency are demanded, 
therefore, giving rise to more urge to utilize the spatial 
resources provided by MIMO technology. However, due to 
the limit of size, power and hardware complexity, it is difficult 
to employ multiple antennas both on ground terminals and 
satellite, especially at the mobile terminal. The installation of 
only one antenna at each user terminal tremendously hampers 
the development of MIMO technology. Recently, cooperative 
diversity technique, which is based on user cooperation and 
relaying cooperation, has emerged as a promising technique 
and received considerable interests[2][3].The spirit of this 
technique lies in that single-antenna terminals in a multi-user 
scenario are allowed to share their antennas and other resources 
through distributed transmission and processing, so that a 
virtual multi-antenna transmitter is formed, hence achieving the 
spatial diversity benefits of the virtual MIMO system.  
When one mobile terminal travels in a large area, severe 
channel conditions, like trees or buildings obstructing signals 
transmitting directly from terminal to satellite might happen, 
resulting in complete blockage of line-of-sight (LOS) path. In 
such situation, cooperative relaying to satellite from other 
terminals under better propagation environments may offer an 
effective way to combat channel fading, enable better reliability 
of communications, as well as reduce the burden of 
transmitting power for the terminal. This kind of cooperative 
relaying communication does not rely on the assistance of 
other terrestrial facilities, making it particularly suitable for 
the gap-filler-less scenario. 
A LMSS is a communication system that provides 
communications to terrestrial mobile users using satellite. 
There have been papers focusing on the outage performance 
under LMSS environments with AF relaying protocol (e.g., 
[4][5]). But, to the best of our knowledge up to now, there has 
been few works on the outage probability analysis on DF and 
CC protocol of LMSS in the literature. However, these two 
protocols can be incorporated with different channel coding 
schemes, having the potential to decrease bit error rate, as well 
as enhance the system feasibility under different channel 
conditions. So, it is also of great importance to investigate the 
outage performance of DF and CC in LMSS.  
In this paper, we are interested in proposing an uplink 
mobile terminal assisted cooperation diversity LMSS using AF 
strategy, DF strategy, and CC strategy, respectively. We 
derive the closed-form expressions of accurately approximated 
outage probabilities for the three protocols. The outage 
performances of these protocols are compared when signal 
from direct terminal to satellite path is undergoing different 
degree of shadowing. The analytical results are verified by 
Monte Carlo simulations.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents the system models and the channel fading 
models. In section III we derive the closed-form expressions 
of approximated outage probabilities for the three relaying 
protocols. The simulation results are presented in section IV. 
Finally, conclusion remarks are made in section V.

SYSTEM MODELS  
A. System Models 
We provide the simple frequency nonselective fading 
system for AF protocol and DF protocol consisting of a source 
terminal, a cooperative relaying terminal, and the land mobile 
satellite (LMS) represented by a GEO satellite, as shown in 
Fig. 1. The source can transmit signal to the relay and the 
satellite at the same time with different frequency bands using 
26

two sets of antennas. But the relay node cannot transmit and 
receive signal using the same frequency at the same time, so 
the half duplex mode is adopted. The time scheduling consists 
of two time slots. In the first time slot, the source transmits its 
signal both to satellite and the cooperative terminal with 
transmitting power
. During the second time slot, the scaled 
version of the signal for AF or regenerated version of the 
signal for DF at the cooperative terminal is transmitted to the 
satellite with transmitting power
. At the satellite, signals 
from source and relay nodes are combined through maximum 
ratio combining (MRC) algorithm.  
Based on Fig. 1, the cooperative diversity system for the 
CC protocol is provided in Fig. 2, where the cooperation 
process is divided into two stages, during which the source 
terminal and its cooperative terminal each transmits a total 
length of 
bits containing
information bits. In the first 
stage, both terminals transmit the information bits to each 
other and to the satellite in
bits code word with 
rate
. Again, two pairs of antennas are used for 
terrestrial communication and satellite communication, 
respectively. If the source node or the relay node cannot 
correctly decode its partner’s code word in the first stage, then 
it transmits
bits code word of its own parity bits 
to the satellite in the second stage, or its partner’s parity bits 
are transmitted. An important parameter of the protocol is the 
cooperation level, defined by
. 
B. Channel Models 
Channel fading coefficient from the source to the 
satellite
is assumed to be shadowed Rician fading, and 
is the corresponding noise power. The probability density 
function 
(PDF) 
of 
the 
instantaneous 
SNR 
per symbol is expressed as [6] 
 (1) 
where
is the average power of the multipath component, 
is the average SNR between the source and 
satellite with variance 
, 
is Nakagami parameter, 
is 
the average power of the LOS component, and
is the 
confluent hypergeometric function.  
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of 
is  
    (2) 
where
is the incomplete gamma function according to 
(8.350.1) [7], 
is the Pochhammer symbol. 
Channel fading coefficients of the source to cooperative 
relay 
 and the relay to source 
are assumed to be 
Rayleigh fading, with the corresponding noise power
. The 
PDFs of the instantaneous SNR 
 and 
per symbol are expressed as  
           (3) 
           (4) 
The CDF of 
and
is given as 
   
           (5) 
            (6) 
where
 is the average SNR from the source to 
the cooperative relay with variance 
, and
 
is the average SNR from the relay to the source with variance 
. 
We assume that there is always a relay terminal having a 
clear sight of the satellite, so the channel fading coefficient 
 can be modeled as Rician fading, with the corresponding 
noise power
. And how to find the proper cooperative 
terminal is left for future work. The PDF of the instantaneous 
SNR 
per symbol is expressed as

OUTAGE PROBABILITY ANALYSIS 
When spectral efficiency is set to R , the whole 
communication system is in outage state when the maximum 
average mutual information
ID
< R
. From the perspective of 
information theory, 
ID
depends on the instantaneous SNR 
γd
of the combined signal at the satellite. The outage 
probability of the source node is

Fig. 3 shows the outage probability comparisons between 
AF, DF, different cooperation level CC, and no cooperation 
transmission with the source to satellite path undergoing 
frequent heavy shadowing. In the figure, all three relaying 
protocols show diversity gain compared to no cooperation 
scenario. For CC protocol, asα gets lower, the slope of curves 
tends to get deeper, which means stronger channel coding 
algorithm for

shown in Fig. 4 and Fig.5). It can be observed from the figure 
that when

DF as

increases with 
transmitting SNR. This is due to the nonmonotone decreasing 
property of 
pγ AF ( )
γ with respect to increasing SNR and the 
channel parameters of the heavy shadowing channel condition. 
Fig. 4 shows the outage probability comparisons between 
the three protocols and no cooperation scenario when the 
source to satellite path is in average shadowing. Fig. 5 shows 
the comparisons in the infrequent light shadowing case. 
Combined with Fig. 3, the three figures illustrate that, the 
better shadowed Rician channel condition is, the lower the 
outage probabilities get, with the exception of DF. As a matter 
of fact, the outage probabilities for the DF protocol are almost 
the same at the same

channel conditions. It can be also seen that, AF and CC 
outperform the no cooperation scenario except for CC

For CC protocol in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, it may be noticed that 
curves of allα values have almost the same trend as in Fig. 3 
except for the curve of 
α = 0.7
. This result can be explained 
as follows. It is found that at higher

Es /
N , the outage 
probability in (14) is mainly determined by the second term 
and the fourth term of the addition operation, the former of 
which is monotonic decreasing while the latter one is convex, 
thanks to the monotonic increasing outage probability in 
Rayleigh channel at high cooperation level
α = 0.7
. Therefore, 
makes it possible for the overall outage possibility to be 
nondecreasing, or even increasing within certain range of

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the outage performance of a dual-hop LMS 
cooperative diversity system is proposed. The closed-form 
expressions of approximated outage probability for three 
important 
and 
commonly 
used 
relaying 
protocols: 
amplify-and-forward, 
decode-and-forward, 
and 
coded 
cooperation, are derived. The simulation results verify the 
analytical results. The results show that for different 
shadowing conditions on source to terminal path, at high 
transmitting SNR, AF protocol is the preferable option to CC 
protocol with high cooperation level, but with low cooperation 
level, or at low transmitting SNR regardless of the cooperation 
level, CC protocol turns out to be the better option for the 
LMS cooperative diversity system. Both CC protocol and AF 
protocol show diversity gain over direct transmission. DF 
protocol is the last choice of the three protocols.
