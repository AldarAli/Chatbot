Abstract—In the last decade, both sustainability (Green & 
Blue Economies) and business models for sustainability 
(BMfS) have increased in importance. Social life cycle 
sustainability assessment has not fully achieved goal, 
mainly because sustainability‐oriented business is very 
complex and dynamic. System Dynamics (SD) is a powerful 
methodology and computer simulation modeling technique 
for framing, understanding and discussing complex issues 
and problems.  This paper responds to the urgent need for 
a new business model by presenting a concept for dynamic 
business modeling for sustainability using system dynamics. 
The paper illustrates the key operating principles through 
an application from the smartphone industry with help 
from STELLA® software for simulation. Simulations 
suggest that dynamic business modeling for sustainability 
may contribute to sustainable business model research and 
practice by introducing a systemic design tool that frames 
environmental, social, and economic drivers of value 
generation into a dynamic business model causal feedback 
structure, therefore overcoming shortcomings of current 
business models when applied to complex systems.  
Keywords— business models design; business models for 
sustainability; system dynamics modeling; sustainability; 
social lifecycle sustainability assessment . 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
In the last decade, both sustainability (Green & Blue 
Economies) and business models for sustainability 
(BMfS) have gained increasing attraction worldwide. 
Research streams are multiplying (e.g., Business Model 
(BM) ontology, Business model design (BMD), BM 
innovation, circular BMs, etc.) as testified by the growing 
number of contributions appearing in scientific journal 
special issues, dedicated conferences, workshops, as well 
as international academic networks [1].  Researchers 
addressed topics such as how to make a supply chain 
sustainable and how to use system dynamics methods to 
analyze sustainability issues in the smartphone lifecycle. 
A. Sustainability issues in the smartphone lifecycle 
Figure 1 shows issues in the smartphone lifecycle, which 
are provided by J. Zufall et al. [2].   
 
Figure 1. Sustainability issues in the smartphone lifecycle. 
 
They also identified seven sustainable business model 
patterns to cover different life cycle phases [3]. This 
paper focuses on the first pattern, “Sustainable Resource 
Company,” during the “Resource Extraction” and “End-
of-Life” phases (see the red labeling in Figure 2. High 
resolution figure can be viewed in Appendix I). Social 
sustainability issues like child labor, poor working 
conditions, low living wages, pollution, and health 
problems caused by toxic materials in e-waste occur 
mainly in these two phases. Our study applied system 
dynamics methods with simulation software to determine 
how a solution applied to a complex system would 
impact environmental, social and economic aspects.

B. System Boundaries 
Life cycle sustainability assessment refers to the 
evaluation of all environmental, social, and economic 
impacts in a decision-making process according to the 
sustainability of products throughout their life cycles [4]. 
Although 
it 
involves 
several 
aspects 
including 
environmental and economic, our study focuses on social 
impacts. The system boundaries we used are presented in 
Figure 3. This research focuses on three categories: 
sustainability, 
environment 
and 
social. 
The 
environmental part is divided into two subcategories - 
upcycling and recycling. Upcycling focuses on the 
evaluation of smartphone function prolongation, and 
recycling focuses on reducing the environmental impact 
of smartphone disposal by recycling its parts. The social 
category focuses on social issues created by resource 
extraction and the manufacturing process [5].  
 
 
Figure 3. System boundaries of this research  
C. Stakeholder -influence matrix 
In August 2019, the Business Roundtable released its 
new stakeholder model of the revised purpose of the 
corporation, stating explicitly that businesses exist to 
serve multiple stakeholders—including shareholders, 
customers, employees, communities, the environment, 
and suppliers.  
The stakeholder model represents an emerging model for 
the strategic vision of a company. Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) metrics can be used to measure 
company performance and its relative positioning on a 
range of topics relevant to the broader set of company 
stakeholders in the same way that financial metrics assess 
company performance for shareholders. This paper 
addresses at a “conceptual” level the key questions and 
guidelines for assessing a company’s readiness for - and 
potential approach to - implementing ESG metrics and 
goals in executive incentive programs [6].  
Figure 4 provides Pay Governance’s generalized 
perspective on the alignment between ESG initiatives and 
stakeholders. The matrix below is illustrative and is not 
exhaustive of all ESG metrics and stakeholder impacts. 
 
Figure 4. ESG metrics and stakeholder impacts 
 
Figure 5 shows the Stakeholder Influence Matrix derived 
from a survey in 2021 and interviews with stakeholders 
from electronic companies including Siemens, Huawei, 
and Samsung.

 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Next, we describe the system dynamics method and 
software. Section III presents the dynamic business 
modeling framework. Section IV discusses the case study

II. SYSTEM DYNAMICS METHOD AND SOFTWARE 
System Dynamics (SD) is a methodology for 
analyzing complex systems and problems over time with 
the aid of computer simulation software [7]. It handles 
complex systems in different domains. SD steps include 
making a loop diagram, connecting the variables, and 
documenting the relationships among them (direct or 
inverse). SD can improve communication and identify 
interactions among different related components in a 
system that enhances decision making policies in 
different scenarios. The modelled systems could be socio-
economic, financial, climatic, or physical. System 
Dynamics models consist of only a few basic types of 
variables which are used to construct stock and flow 
diagrams with feedback loops and delays [8]. 
 
Table I lists software tools for simulation [9]. 
Dynamo was a breakthrough and foreshadowed several 
numerical modeling approaches and non-procedural 
programming languages [10]. It was a text-based system 
for representing model equations and continued to be 
used for multiple decades. Current software for System 
dynamics is diagram-based, but equations are still part of 
the model and retain forms quite similar to those of 
Dynamo.  
Other modeling products include Anylogic, Goldsim, 
Berkely Madonna, Sysdea, and SimGua. Vensim, Insight 
Maker, and StatSim are free for education and personal 
use.

2.1.x).  
III. DYNAMIC BUSINESS MODELING FRAMEWORK 
Cosenz et al. proposed a dynamic business modeling 
for sustainability approach that combines an adapted 
sustainable business model canvas and system dynamics 
modeling. They also reviewed the state of the art in 
Design Business Modeling for Sustainability (DBMfS) 
design tools [1]. 
Building on this comprehensive literature review, the 
paper proposes and illustrates the DBMfS approach as a 
lean systemic method to model and explore sustainable 
value creation processes. Then, following a qualitative 
perspective, the approach is tested empirically. Figure 6 
shows the research approach.

IV. CASE STUDY WITH SMARTPHONE 
A. Selecting a case study 
Smartphone has been chosen as case study for this 
research because of its ubiquity and the global 
cooperation involved in many types of products.  
A huge part of the world population uses 
smartphones. 
• 
7.9 billion people by 2020 
• 
6 billion smartphones end of 2020 
• 
In average 1.5 billion new smartphones 
produced per year 
• 
36 smartphones are produced per second, which 
exceeds the human birth rate  
 
A typical smartphone lifecycle includes the following: 
• 
Mine/Mine Traders#, Smelters/Refinery in DRC# 
• 
Design, development, marketing, and creation of 
software in USA.  
• 
Mixed-signal chips (such as NFC): NXP from 
Netherlands; accelerometer from Bosch in 
Germany, Gyroscope from Italy/France 
• 
Smelters/Refinery in China and  
• 
Batteries** & Flash memory from Korea 
• 
Display/Camera and eCompass from Japan 
• 
Touch ID Sensor and DRAM mostly from 
Taiwan 
• 
Plastic Construction in Singapore 
• 
Assembly in China# 
• 
Disposal/Dismantle/Recycle## done mostly in 
Africa and China 
Figure 8 presents the globalization of a typical 
smartphone (high resolution figure can be viewed in 
Appendix III).

Child labor might be hidden in the smartphone’s 
supply chain [12], e.g., in Resource extraction and 
process, or End-of-Life phase.  
Recently, many have expressed concerns about 
smartphone issues such as adverse impact on the 
environment from pollution in manufacturing and failure 
to recycle. The industry pays workers poorly, provides 
unhealthy working conditions, and employs children.  
Figure 9 shows that smartphone manufacturers use 
deadly chemicals and up to 46 precious materials, like tin, 
tantalum, tungsten, Gold (3TG) and cobalt [13].  
 
Figure 9. Application of Tantalum, Molybdenum and other metals in 
Mobile Phones 
 
In 2020, smartphones averaged 8 grams of cobalt vs. 
28 grams in a laptop, and 6803 grams in an Electric 
Vehicle (EV). Statista, the global Business Data 
Platform, reported 1.38 smartphones sold to end users 
worldwide in 2020 and projected 1.53 billion by 2021. 
222.5 million laptops were shipped in 2020, and 276.8 
million are expected in 2021. EVs numbered 6.0 million 
at the end of 2020. The total amount of cobalt used in 
smartphone is about 11250 tons vs. 62967 tons in laptops 
and 40800 tons in EVs. Table II summaries the total 
cobalt usage by the end of 2020 in different electric 
devices.

Cobalt is a metal that occurs naturally in rocks, water, 
plants, and animals. Cobalt is less toxic than many other 
metals. At low levels, it is beneficial to human health and 
is a component of vitamin B12. But it is dangerous in 
high doses. Health risks depend on the amount and 
duration of exposure. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention in the US warns that chronic exposure can 
cause “hard metal disease” and even skin contact with 
cobalt salts or hard metals can result in rashes. They say 
the safe workweek limit is 0.1 milligrams per cubic 
meters. 
Cobalt is used in alloys, semiconductors, fertilizer, as 
a drying agent for varnish and enamel coating for steel. In 
the form of cobalt sulphate, it is particularly important in 
lithium batteries, where it acts as a cathode stabilizer. 
Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly in demand for 
electric cars, laptops and mobile phones, which means 
cobalt – once deemed a worthless chemical – is now the 
object of rivalry between the world’s biggest economies.  
A study from Kosiorek and Wyszkowski [14], shows that 
global production had increased more than sevenfold 
between 2008 and 2015 with an increasingly evident 
impact. “The appearance of cobalt levels exceeding 
environmental threshold levels has led to disturbances in 
the proper functioning of living organisms,” the paper 
concluded.  
Amnesty International says human rights abuses, 
including the use of child labor, in the extraction of 
minerals, like cobalt, used to make the batteries that 
power electric vehicles, are undermining ethical claims 
about the cars. 
The environmental impact extends through the 
lifecycle of the product from refineries, battery plants, 
consumers goods manufacturers, electronic recycling 
facilities and waste dumps. Among the most affected are 
workers at poorly regulated mines [15]. This has 
allegedly reached alarming levels in the Congo, As it is 
the largest cobalt mining country globally, this country is 
also by far the largest producer of cobalt intermediates. 
They produced 87.7kt Cobalt contained in intermediates 
in 2020, accounting for 68% of the global supply [1].  
V. MODELING  WITH SIMULATION SOFTWARE 
STELLA®  
A. Identify paramters  
Cobalt issues are paramount. e.g., reduce cobalt 
extraction while satisfying the increasing demand for 
cobalt in Lithium-ion batteries. 
1) 
Reduce cobalt extraction from mines 
2) 
Increase cobalt recovery from spent cemented 
carbide  
3) 
Increase cobalt recovery from spent Lithium-
Ion smartphone batteries using liquid–liquid extraction  
a) Increasing recovery of cobalt from smartphone 
Lithium-Ion Batteries is one way to reduce cobalt 
extraction from mines.  
4) 
Extend cobalt usage cycle by extending 
smartphone lifespan  
b) Increasing the 25% smartphone recycle rate 
or extending the 2.5-year smartphone lifespan can also 
reduce the demand on new cobalt, especially cobalt 
extracted from mines.   
c) The lifespan may be extended by (i) repairing 
smartphones instead of discarding them (e.g., change the 
battery or screen) (ii) increasing usage of second-hand 
phones. (iii) more frequently updating software to 
improve smartphone performance, thereby reducing 
demand for new phones.  
5) 
Low-cobalt or cobalt-free battery design 
 
Figure 10 shows a simplified STELLA® model with 
the above parameters that simulates cobalt usage in a 
smartphone (high resolution figure can be viewed in 
Appendix IV).

Parameter 3: Discard (smartphone) 
Parameter 4: Recovery Li.B. from discarded phone

Parameter 5: Recovery cobalt from Li.B. 
Parameter 6: Cobalt-free battery 
Parameter 7: Production of e-Vehicles 
Parameter 8: Production of PC (including Desktop, 
Notebook, Ultra-Portable personal computers) 
… 
Since it is almost impossible to get real data without 
company support, we used statistical data. 
The goal of this model is to show the possible 
measures, which can be taken to reduce the raw material 
extraction in certain period, then indirectly solve the 
related social issues like child labor, unfair Payment, 
worse working condition, etc.  
 Cobalt it taken as one example of relevant raw 
material because it comes from mines in areas 
with severe social problems. 
 The typical and reasonable time span for long-
term projects is 10 ~20 years. 
 The measurements are those parameters for the 
model defined above. 
The lowest target is to keep the current cobalt 
extraction amount (considering of the increasing demand 
on e-Vehicles and smartphones).  
Figures 11-13 show the calibration result of the 
model. For example, Figure 11 illustrates graphically the 
Model calibration concerning mobile phone reuse/repair 
& discard. By calibrating Parameter 1 (Reuse), 
Parameter 2 (Delay of Reuse.) and Parameter 3 
(Discard), increasing the rate of Reuse/Repair for Mobile 
Phone, extending the lifespan of Mobile Phone (increase 
the delay of reuse), reducing the rate of discard (see the 
line for “MP in use”) will reduce first then stay steady. 
More mobile phones are reused phone (see the line for 
“MP Reuse”). The total number of phones on the market 
stays steady too, assuming the population is unchanged. 
The more phones are reused, the part of garbage caused 
by reused phone increase too.

illustrates 
the 
Model 
Calibration 
concerning Cobalt Supply and Demand. The X 
(horizontal) axis is the time axis, the Y (the vertical) axis 
is the unit axis, with measurement unit in Tons. By 
calibrating Parameter 4 (Recovery Li.B. from discarded 
phone) & Parameter 5 (Recovery cobalt from Li.B.), 
increasing the rate of recovery Lithium battery from 
Mobile Phone, and rate of cobalt recovery from lithium 
battery, the cobalt supply for Mobile Phone production 
increases too. Assume the demand on Cobalt keeps 
steady, then less cobalt would be extracted from mines. 
(see the vertical black line, shown in Figure 12, to the 
year of 8).

C. Visualization and Simulation of Model  
With the help of STELLA®, a user can explore 
different assumptions and see the outcomes over time; 
add objects for interacting with the model such as action 
run buttons for simulating, and for viewing results such 
as graphs, tables, and gauges. 
Figure 14 is one example, shows the immediately 
visualization how variables affect each other during a 
simulation.  Here “Garbage Reuse” is taken as output, 
the relevant variables are “% of reuse rate”, “delay of 1st. 
Reuse”, “delay of 2nd. Reuse”, “the rate of discard”, “the 
amount of cobalt usage in each Mobile Phone unit”. 
Table III list the value setting for each variable in 
each run. Table IV is the simulation result of “Garbage 
Reuse” for each run over time frame of 20 years.

Figure 15 shows an extension of the model in Figure 
10 that covers financial aspects. Take repair as example. 
Assume the repair cost per year per unit of a phone is 
about 30 Euro annually and a new phone costs about 200 
Euro per year for a 2-year life span. Figures 16(A) & 
16(B) show the simulation results of the total costs over 
time. To this time point, this simulation is simplified by 
assuming the repair also happens in the first two years of 
usage. Repairing a phone is worthwhile after about 3

VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
Model-building and calibration will continue, until a 
satisfactory number of parameters are accounted for. 
Parameters from economic and financial aspects will be 
added to the model. However, the more parameters 
added, the more complex the system will be. Statistical 
analysis of empirical data can help estimate some 
structural parameters of the model. This study 
contributed to the state of the art by applying system 
dynamic modeling and simulation to sustainability. 
We provided researchers a new perspective for 
investigations into employing novel design tools and 
simulation to analyze complex systems. Practitioners 
could benefit from a better understanding of issues of a 
product or industry branch. The proposed DBMfS 
approach might aid policymakers in the development of 
sustainability‐related regulations.  
Applicability of our findings is limited by our use of 
statistics rather than real data from a company. 
Gathering both structural and non-structural data would 
strengthen findings in this research area. In the future, 
real data from a smart phone company will be very 
valuable to validate the model built and the solutions or 
parameters applied to the model.
