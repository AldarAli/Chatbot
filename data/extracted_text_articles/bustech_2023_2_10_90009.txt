Abstract—There is a trend in organizations to go beyond 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and consider 
Customer Experience Management (CEM). While CRM 
software tools are widespread, CEM software tools are more 
recent and not as refined. Most existing CEM software tools 
focus on collecting and analyzing feedback from customers. 
However, the CEM process encompasses several other activities, 
such as designing the desired customer experience. This paper 
reviews the literature to synthesize what technologies and tools 
can assist managers in each activity of the CEM process.  
Keywords-customer 
experience 
management; 
tools; 
technologies; literature review. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Gaining and sustaining a competitive advantage is a 
daunting challenge in today’s fast-changing environment. 
According 
to 
some, 
customer 
experience 
is 
what 
organizations will now have to compete in to stand out from 
their competitors [1]. This would be the case in any industry, 
whether it be banking [2][3][4], hospitality and tourism 
[5][6][7], communications [8][9], retail [10][11], and online 
commerce [12][13]. For instance, supply chain management, 
which used to focus on product development and order 
processing, is now also looking at Customer Experience 
Management (CEM or CXM) as a source of competitive 
advantage [14]. 
Customer experience can be defined as the “customer 
sensorial, physiological, psychological responses such as 
cognitive as well as affective responses evoked by the 
customer direct (offline) and indirect (online) interactions 
with the firm or firm offerings across all the touch points 
throughout the customer purchase journey” [15]. The 
emotional and sensorial components of the customer 
experience, as well as the fact that it encompasses all 
interactions that a customer has with a brand [16], make it 
challenging to manage.  
Naturally, the customer experience is closely related to 
Information Technology (IT). To begin with, customers often 
learn about a brand through online advertising and social 
media [17]. They interact with organizations through various 
channels, including on their mobile phones, and interact 
closely with technology even in brick-and-mortar stores (e.g., 
self-check-out [18]). The simple fact of including IT can 
improve customer experience even in unexpected settings, 
such as in temples [19]. 
Of course, IT is also useful and needed in managing the 
customer experience. To that effect, CEM software tools have 
begun appearing on the market, but they mainly focus on 
collecting and analyzing feedback from customers. While this 
is helpful, many other activities are required to manage 
customer experience, such as designing the desired customer 
experience. 
In contrast, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
software tools are a lot more established and cover all 
activities encompassing the management of customer 
relationships. For instance, Buttle and Maklan [20] propose 
four steps to manage customer relationships, i.e., 1) Identify 
who your customers are and build a deep understanding of 
them; 2) Differentiate your customers to identify which 
customers have most value now and which offer most for the 
future; 3) Interact with customers to ensure that you 
understand customer expectations and their relationships with 
other suppliers or brands; and 4) Customize the offer and 
communications to ensure that the expectations of customers 
are met. CRM software tools available on the market 
commonly cover those four steps.  
Therefore, organizations run the risk of focusing only on 
the activities currently supported by CEM software tools, to 
the detriment of their customers’ experience. Thus, to offset 
the limits of current available CEM software tools, the 
objective of this paper is to review the literature to identify 
technologies and tools which can help managers in each 
activity of the CEM process. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
discusses customer experience and the steps required to 
manage it. Section III describes the methodology used to 
conduct our literature review. Section IV presents the results. 
Lastly, Section V concludes the paper and gives implications 
for future research. 
II. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT 
CEM first appeared in the literature in the late 1990s, when 
Pine and Gilmore [21] stated in Harvard Business Review that 
providing experiences was the next discipline that would 
enable organizations to remain competitive. They explain that 
although some confuse the delivery of an experience with that 
of a service, they are two distinct approaches. According to 
18

these authors, while products and services are external to the 
customer, “experiences are inherently personal, existing only 
in the mind of an individual who has been engaged on an 
emotional, physical, intellectual, or even spiritual level” [21].  
Indeed, customer experience is described as the 
“aggregate of feelings, perceptions and attitudes” formed by 
the customer throughout their journey, at each touchpoint 
[22]. Since customer experience is such a complex, multi-
faceted concept, its management is naturally just as intricate. 
CEM is defined as “the cultural mindsets toward CEs, 
strategic directions for designing CEs, and firm capabilities 
for continually renewing CEs, with the goals of achieving and 
sustaining long-term customer loyalty” [23]. While there is no 
agreed-upon CEM process in the literature, several similar 
processes are suggested, some of which are adapted to a 
particular industry.  
Du Plessi and de Vries [24] conducted a literature review 
and used inductive thematic analysis to describe the CEM 
process in four steps and twelve sub-steps. The first step is 
Customer 
experience 
understanding, 
which 
includes 
segmenting customers and defining their needs. The second 
step is Customer experience design, which consists of 
mapping the desired customer journeys. The third step is 
Customer experience measurement. The last step, Customer 
experience change implementation, consists of identifying the 
gaps between the current and the desired experience, and 
taking action to close those gaps.  
More recently, Rahiman, ShamiZanjani, Manian and 
Esfidani [25] proposed four high-level CEM stages, each 
containing steps. They were identified through a systematic 
review of the literature on the hotel, tourism, and hospitality 
industry. The four stages are Customer identification, 
Customer 
experience 
design, 
Customer 
experience 
implementation, and Customer experience monitoring. They 
are very similar to the steps identified by [24] and cover 
approximately the same activities.  
For the remainder of this paper, we have taken together the 
stages and steps proposed by [24] and [25] to use as a CEM 
process. They are presented in Table I. While the steps follow 
a logical sequence, the process is iterative, since the 
customers, as well as their experiences, are constantly 
changing. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
We conducted a literature review with the objective of 
identifying technologies and tools that can assist management 
in each step of the CEM process. The first step was to search 
the relevant literature. The flow diagram is presented in Fig. 
1. We searched the online database ABI/INFORM and limited 
our scope to peer-reviewed articles. A preliminary search 
informed us that relevant articles used at least the expression 
‘customer experience’ and most contained the word 
‘technology’ or ‘technologies’. We also decided to use the 
keywords ‘software’ and ‘tool’ to be as comprehensive as 
possible. We consequently used three search strings, 
presented in Fig. 1. The expression “technolog*” was used to 
account for both singular and plural forms of the word. To 
focus on articles more closely related to our research topic, we 
search everywhere except full text. We thereby identified

572 articles, which came down to 438 once the duplicates 
were removed. 
The second step consisted of screening the identified 
studies. We read the identified articles’ title and abstract. 
Fourteen articles were excluded because they were not in 
English.  
Then, in the third step, we read the articles relevant to our 
research topic in their entirety. We found 51 articles that 
proposed technologies and/or tools that can be helpful in the 
CEM process. It should be noted that the use of the Internet

was not retained, as it is broad and omnipresent in all 
organizations nowadays. Websites and technologies that are 
specific to a certain industry, such as exhibition service 
systems [26], were also excluded. The included articles’ 
publication dates range from 1998 to 2023, with five articles 
published before 2005 and 33 since 2018. 
Once we had extracted all technologies and tools, we 
performed a qualitative synthesis to collect them all in a 
unified list. As a final step, we identified which technologies 
and tools can be used in each step of the CEM process. The 
results are presented in the next section. 
IV. RESULTS 
After reviewing the literature as described in Section III, 
we were able to identify 35 technologies and tools that can 
assist in managing the customer experience. They are 
presented in alphabetical order in Table II. A few similar 
technologies were gathered, such as artificial intelligence and 
machine learning.  
Table III presents in alphabetical order the technologies 
and tools that can assist management in each step of the CEM 
process. The steps are those identified in Table I in Section II. 
The activities composing each step are not repeated to lighten 
the presentation. Some technologies and tools can be useful in 
more than one step and thus appear more than once in the 
table. 
It is no surprise that the first step of the CEM process, 
Customer identification, can be supported by technologies 
such as analytics, data mining, and database management. 
These technologies are helpful in segmenting customers, 
assessing their characteristics, and understanding their needs. 
The second step of CEM, Customer experience design, 
consists primarily of designing the customer journeys and 
experiences as a whole. Customer experience/journey 
mapping and modeling tools are thus essential. Co-creation is 
a prominent concept in customer experience literature. To that 
end, technologies/applications enabling co-creation allow 
organizations to engage customers in the design of their 
customer experience. Although this step is central to CEM, 
very few technologies and tools were found. However, 
designing the customer experience is a crucial step of CEM. 
Indeed, the implementation can only be as good as the design. 
Therefore, there seems to be an opportunity to explore what 
technologies and tools could potentially support customer 
experience design. 
The third step, Customer experience implementation, is 
the one for which the most useful technologies were found. 
This is mainly because there exist a plethora of different 
technologies and tools that allow organizations to interact and 
engage with their customers, such as Artificial Intelligence 
(AI), Augmented reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), call 
centers, chatbots, digital kiosks, monitors, messaging 
applications, social media, smart devices, etc. Digital twins, 
which are “a dynamic virtual representation of a physical 
object or system across its lifecycle” [27] also allow 
organizations to interact with customers, as well as to collect 
data that is useful in the next step of the CEM process, i.e., 
Customer experience monitoring. Balanced scorecards, on the 
other hand, are useful for prioritizing improvement initiatives.

There is also a considerable number of relevant 
technologies for the last step of CEM, which is Customer 
experience monitoring. Indeed, analytics, data mining, 
chatbots, geolocation technology, Internet of Things (IoT), 
and video recording are all examples of technologies and tools 
that can be used to measure customer experience and flag 
incidents. CRM tools/software can also be used and they 
themselves contain powerful analytics capabilities. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This literature review allowed us to identify 35 
technologies and tools that can help management in the CEM 
process, which were associated with the specific step(s) in 
which they can be used. This contributes to assisting 
organizations to manage the customer experience process 
from start to finish, thereby improving customer experience.

This study has some limitations. The scope of our research 
was limited, as we only searched in one database. Moreover, 
we did not find any technology covering all four steps of the 
CEM process in our review of the literature. This could cause 
a lag between the time a weakness in the customer experience 
is flagged during customer experience monitoring and the 
time it is addressed during the continuous improvement of the 
customer experience design. There is thus a need for a system 
capable of covering all activities of CEM. This could allow 
organizations to be more agile and make their customer 
experience evolve seamlessly, thereby giving them a non-
negligible competitive advantage. As a future research 
avenue, we suggest investigating how such a system could be 
designed, or how some of the existing technologies and tools 
could be connected and organized to work seamlessly as one 
system.
