Abstract— We propose a novel method to identify 
desirable leader images in each situation. Leader's 
characteristics have been researched. However, many 
researchers could not find unique his/her characteristics. 
Therefore, desirable characteristics are different in each 
situation which he/her meets. In order to capture the 
desirable characters in each situation, we apply the 
persona technique, which was firstly introduced by 
Cooper and then has been spread in the field of product 
development. The proposed method is characterized by 
the procedure: 1) set persona characters with various 
attributes, 2) assign the attribute values by orthogonal 
design techniques, 3) set virtual business situations, 4) 
based on the business situations, get questionnaire data 
on the personas from subjects, and 5) evaluate the data 
to get the leader images of the corresponding business 
situations. As results of our method, we detected the 
different in the sense of designed characters' attributes 
in each situation.

 INTRODUCTION 
A. Necessity and difficulty of the research on leader 
images 
According to literature[1], leaders are made, not born, 
and made more by themselves. We also have the position 
that leaders can raise later. 
In business organizations, leaders' roles are very 
important. Leaders' capability influences the rise and fall of 
their organization. Leaders have the role which guides and 
raises subordinates. If leaders are excellent, the organization 
can gain a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is the most 
important proposition to raise excellent leaders in business 
organizations.[2] 
However, the research on training of leaders is 
incomplete. Leaders' required capability is not uniform. 
Leaders need to be well versed in the operation of their 
organization. Moreover, they are urged to carry out business 
smoothly with bosses and subordinates. Furthermore, they 
need to learn the conceptualization capability to understand 
and draw enterprises. Since business conditions differ for 
every organization, you cannot define leaders' capability 
uniformly. This is one of the difficult reasons for the 
research on leader images. 
B. What is "personas" - From Cooper’s Idea 
In marketing and user-centered design, personas are 
virtual characters created to represent the different user types 
within a targeted demographic, attitude or behavior set that 
might use a site, brand or product in a similar way. [4] 
Personas are useful in considering the goals, desires, and 
limitations of brand buyers and users in order to help to 
guide decisions about a service, product or interaction space 
such as features, interactions, and visual design of a website. 
Personas may also be used as part of a user-centered design 
process for designing software and are also considered a part 
of interaction design, having been used in industrial design 
and more recently for online marketing purposes. A user 
persona is a representation of the goals and behavior of a 
hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are 
synthesized from data collected from interviews with users. 
They are captured in 1 page descriptions that include 
behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment, 
with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a 
realistic character. 
Alan Cooper, a noted pioneer software developer, 
developed the concept, which he named personas. From 
1995 he became engaged with how a specific rather than 
generalized user would use and interface with software. The 
technique was popularized for the online business and 
technology community in his 1999 book “The Inmates are 
running the Asylum”.[3] In this book, Cooper outlines the 
general characteristics, uses and best practices for creating 
personas, recommending that software be designed for 
single archetypal users. 
In this paper, we applied the persona technique to 
drawing the leader images of companies. Usually, in the 
case 
of 
"persona" 
creation, 
minute 
fixed-quantity 
investigation and close qualitative investigation are required. 
[5] Actually, neither expense nor time and effort can be 
applied to "persona" creation. So, in this research, we 
devised the simple technique which collateralizes fixed 
rationality and probability.

II. 
PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH 
In knowledge management literature, it is critical to 
identify desirable leader characteristics. Different business 
environments, however, require different types of business 
leaders. While business environment changes early, it is 
difficult to take agreement about the desirable leader 
characteristic. In this paper, we propose a novel method to 
identify desirable leader images using virtual characters. We 
take in personas to research of the leader characteristic.[8] 
By application of an experimental design, we aim at 
making the number of choices of questionnaire items into 
the minimum. We aim at obtaining high-precision results 
with few samples by utilizing conjoint analysis.[7] 
The outline of the proposed method is summarized as 
follows: 1) set persona characters with various attributes, 2) 
assign the attribute values by orthogonal design techniques, 
3) set virtual business situations, 4) based on the business 
situations, get questionnaire data on the personas from 
subjects, and 5) evaluate the data to get the leader images of 
the corresponding business situations. 
 
III. 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON THE PROPOSED METHOD 
A. From Leaders’ Requirements to Their Capability 
Assignment 
In the research [6] on the leader image of ICT 
organizations, 25 requirements were probed as capability 
required for the leaders. In the paper, nine core 
competencies are drawn by systematic examination as most 
important requirements for capability, which is summarized 
in TABLE I.  
TABLE I.

and positivism  
The subject of a high level is set up 
actively and the best is always 
concentrated towards achievement.

which 
can 
promote two or more proposal affair 
efficiently, is drawn up.  
6 
Communication  
A confidential relation with a partner 
can be built through "hearing it" and 
"talking."  
7 
Negotiation/  
Adjustment power 
The 
merit 
to 
the 
company 
by 
developing a system is recognized, 
and in-company adjustment can be 
carried out.  
 
Since we used the orthogonal array (L8) this time, we 
needed to extract the item from nine to seven. Then, we 
removed "management control and the initiative", and 
"theory and policy." We take up "Practical Skill", 
"achievement 
volition 
and 
positivism", 
"judgment", 
"subordinate training", "the imaginative power and a vision", 
"communication", and "negotiation / adjustment power." 
Of course, the person who has full capacity is excellent. 
However, there are few such business leaders and it is 
difficult to expect young leaders’ full capacity. Then, we 
created the orthogonal array as shown in TABLE II, and it 
was made to get an experiment candidate to choose talented 
people suitable as a business leader. By using the orthogonal 
array as shown in TABLE II, we did the work which can 
perform many comparisons in spite of few selections. 
TABLE II.  
COMBINATION OF BUSINESS LEADER'S CAPABILITY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(L8 array) 
 
In this array, Type A means holding all the capability on 
the average. Type B to H means excelling in any 4 
capability. 
 
B.  Setups of  of the Experiment 
We have designed the experiment as follows. We 
prepared the questionnaire vote. Respondents should answer 
individually about the following three cases. From the 
viewpoint of the conformity to the case, we requested 
respondents to attach leader type ranking. 
TABLE III.  
SETUP OF EACH CASE AND OTHERS 
 
The situation of organizations 
Case 1
The achievements of this organization tend to descend. 
If the leader does not take bold measures, this 
organization does not have the future. 
Case 2
The achievements of this organization are upward. The 
atmosphere of this organization is bright. 
Case 3
The achievements of this organization are safe for the 
time being. However, the future of this organization is 
slightly opaque.

We printed eight personas (from Type A to Type H) on 
small papers, and arranged on the desk. We requested 
respondents to rearrange those papers from the viewpoint of 
the conformity to the case (Figure 2). 
At the following three places, we used the same 
questionnaire and collected the reply data of 25 votes. 
1)  The seminar of the Tokyo Institute of Technology 
graduate school : 13 votes 
2)  The study group of the Mitsubishi group : 5 votes 
3)  The seminar hall of a certain society : 7 votes 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Results of Simple Totals 
1)  Case 1 (the achievements of this organization tend 
to descend) 
At the very top was Type G (Practical Skill, achievement 
volition, imaginative power, communication) among the 
types chosen as the 1st place. The next was Type D and 
Type E.

Figure 4.  (Case 1) Assigned total score 
 
We assigned 8 points to the type chosen as the 1st place. 
Similarly, we assigned 7 points to the 2nd place and  ..., 
assigned 1 point to the 8th place, and we totaled the whole. 
As a result, at the very top was Type G among, and the next 
was Type E and Type D. 
 
2) Case 2 (the achievements of this organization are 
upward) 
At the very top was Type B (Cultivating HR, the 
imaginative power, communication, and negotiation power) 
among the personas chosen as the 1st place. Although the 
next was Type F and H, there was no difference not much. 
(Fig. 5)  
The assigned sum total vote was also the same result. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.  (Case 2) Type selected as the 1st place 
 
3) Case 3 (the achievements of this organization are 
safe for the time being) 
At the very top was Type D (achievement volition, 
judgment, Cultivating H R, imaginative power) among the 
types chosen as the 1st place. The next was Type B. Other 
types are seldom chosen. (Fig. 6) 
The assigned total score have also shown also the similar 
results.

B. Results of Requirements for Capabilities 
Below, we analyzed questionnaire results taking 
advantage of this orthogonal array. The seven competencies 
were allocated to each persona by the L-8 orthogonal array. 
We analyzed which the competencies for the leader were 
thought as important, when the respondents rank (the best: 
1st - the worst: 8th) the leader personas.  Then as well as the 
conjoint-analysis, we applied the multiple regression 
analysis for the sensitivity of the respondents' evaluation. In 
the multiple regression analysis, the response variable is 
"score (= 8 - rank, the best: 7 - the worst: 0)" and the 
explanatory variables are the existence of the seven 
competencies (0-1 data, absence: 0, existence: 1). The 
multiple regression analysis under the three cases of 
organizational 
situation 
illustrates 
how 
the 
seven 
competencies contribute to the score. 
 
1) Case 2 (the achievements of this organization are 
upward) 
The requirements for the business leader needed a little 
for this organization are "subordinate training" capability. 
There was no significant difference between the seven 
competencies, 
the 
effect-size: 
r2 
(coefficient 
of 
determination) = 0.08. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  (Case 2) Requirements for capability in high performance 
organization 
 
 
2) Case 3 (the achievements of this organization are 
safe for the time being) 
The requirements for the business leader needed for this 
organization are "the imaginative power and a vision", and 
"subordinate training." Clearly different from the Case 2, the 
outcome shows the relatively middle – long range (Vision, 
Cultivating HR) competencies are clearly significant. The 
effect-size: r2 (coefficient of determination) = 0.29.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.  (Case 3) Requirements for capability in dull organization 
 
 
3) Case 1 (the achievements of this organization tend to 
descend) 
The requirements for the business leader needed for this 
organization are "the imaginative power and a vision." 
Subsequently, "judgment" and "achievement volition and 
positivism" are needed. Clearly different from both of the 
Case 2&3, the outcome shows the relatively short range 
competencies become clearly significant instead of the 
relatively long range one (Cultivating HR). The effect-size: 
r2 (coefficient of determination) = 0.35.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the literature of competency research so far, leaders' 
requirements for capability were explored by decomposing 
leaders' behavioral trait. Therefore, it was difficult to discern 
the strength between capability elements. We were able to 
draw the requirements for business leaders by the easy 
questionnaire. 
Compared with such conventional research methods, the 
proposed technique is based on the idea of questionnaire 
design using an orthogonal array. Rearrangement of 8 types 
is equal to having performed the paired comparison 28 times. 
It has succeeded in eliminating principle and pulling out 
respondents' potential opinion with this technique. 
Another unique feature of the method comes from the 
concept of a "disposable persona." People have concern 
strong against people. Then, we set up the personas as items 
of the questionnaire. 
We have observed the statistical difference by easy 
situation setup. The results have suggested that, according to 
the business situations, the desired leader images are clearly 
different in the sense of designed characters' attributes. 
In our future work, we have a plan to have interview 
sessions with excellent leaders of the cooperation companies. 
Then we will extract the parameters of the rectangular tables. 
Such future work includes the following points: 
 
How are appropriate items incorporated in an 
orthogonal array?  
 
What is the suitable method of analyzing the 
collected data? 
 
Is the simple persona of this technique appropriate 
compared with an originator persona? 
 
Then, we will expand the research topics in the 
following points: 
 
We will conceive of the new human resource 
management technique by the experiment base. 
 
We are going to collect data in ICT leaders' training 
domain. We will build the practical simulation base.
