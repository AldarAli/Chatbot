Abstract—This research aims to carry out a topological study
of social networks located in university forums of the Moodle
platform. Graphs are built visualizing the structure of the
nodes and links and calculating statistical parameters such as:
degree, betweenness centrality, clustering coefﬁcient, PageRank,
EigenVector centrality and assortativity. The communities’ struc-
ture was also estimated. This study analyzes how students and
faculties work and socialize in the educational environment, which
help to know more precisely the level of involvement of each
student as well as to improve some learning and methodological
aspects. Several subjects and forums are analyzed (theoretical
and practical contents).
Keywords–social networks; graph; topological study

INTRODUCTION
Virtual Educational Platforms help to increase the motiva-
tion of the students in the courses, providing mechanisms to
facilitate the interaction between students and teachers. These
platforms include applications such as: content management,
collaborative communication and monitoring and evaluation
tools, administration utilities, as well as other functionalities
such as notebook, content searches, etc. Several research exists
about tools used for online teaching blogs, discussion boards,
wikis and 3D virtual [1][2]. Studies on Learning Management
Systems (LMS) have also been carried out [3][4]. There also
are investigations that pretend to gain some insight into how
teachers and students use the LMS. The interaction between
students in online discussion Forums has been studied in
detail using Social Network Analysis [5] and other methods
[6][7]. This paper analizes the social interactions that happened
in Moodle, when this platform was used in the context of
a university course. Several topological parameters and the
structure of communities were calculated. 14 forums each with
an average of 115 students were studied. Three types of forums
were considered: news and questions forums, practical exercise
forums and theoretical content forums.
II.
ANALYZING THE SOCIAL NETWORKS
The XML ﬁle of the Moodle forums was analyzed and
processed using software programs implemented in Python.
These programs were designed, built and tested, following the
typical life cycle of any software component. The interactions
in each forum were represented in a graph G = (V; S), where V
is the set of nodes corresponding to students and faculties and
S is the set of links between them. The package networkx was
used in order to analyze the structure of the social network. The
following parameters [8][9], and their statistical distributions
were calculated:
A. Betweenness centrality
The betweenness centrality of a node n can be deﬁned as:
b(n) =
X
u̸=n̸=w
σuw(n)
σuw
(1)
Where
σuw is the total number of shortest paths from node u to node
w
σuw(n) is the number of those paths that pass through n
B. Node clustering coefﬁcient
The clustering coefﬁcient C(n) of a node n can be deﬁned
as:
C(n) =
2 ∗ t(n)
d(n) ∗ (d(n) − 1)
(2)
Where
t(n) is the number of triangles containing n.
d(n) is the degree of n
C. EigenVector centrality
The EigenVector centrality of a node n can be deﬁned as
xn = 1
λ
N
X
j=1
xj = 1
λ
N
X
j=1
Aij ∗ xj
(3)
Where
Aij is element ij of the Adjacency Matrix, such as Aij= 1 if
node i is attached to node j and 0 otherwise. This equivalent
to A∗X = λ∗X where λ is the largest EigenValue associated
with A and X is its associated EigenVector.
D. PageRank
The PageRank centrality, PR, of a node n can be deﬁned
as:
PR(n) = (1 − α) + α ∗
X
w∈V :w→n
PR(w)
k(w)
(4)
Where α, damping parameter, ∈ [0,1]
PR(w) is the PageRank of the node w which is linked to n.
E. Assortativity
Assortativity of a network evaluates the probability of
connection between pairs of nodes [9].

RESULTS
Table I shows the average m´ınimum distance between
nodes <l>, the average betweeness <b>, the average PageR-
ank <PR>, the average EigenVector centrality <EV>, the
average degree <K> and ﬁnally, the average clustering <C>
values for each discussion forum. The Figure 1 shows as
an example the betweeness distribution in the Forum F1.
We also measure the similarities between vertices by means
of Walktrap Algorithm [3] which uses random walks on G
to identify communities. This method creates a sequence of
partitions (µk) 1≤k≥n, and chooses the best partition of the
network, calculating Qk for each partition and selecting the
partition that maximizes this parameter. The modularity Q is
deﬁned as the fraction of edges within communities minus the
expected value of the same quantity for a random network. The
Table II depicts, in each forum, the number of communities
per teorethical (T), practical excercises (P) and News and
Questions Forums. It can observed that the highest number of
communities happened for the practical exercises forums and
the lowest number occurred for new and questions forums. The
Figure 2 shows as an example the communities in the Forum
F5 for the practical forum.

CONCLUSIONS
The research allows to establish a methodology to analyze
the interactions between students and faculties in educational
forums.
The density and cohesion of the components have been
studied. It has also identiﬁed the more participatory persons
as well as the position that each of them occupies in the
network as a whole (power relationships), which has been
carried out through the analysis of different types of centrality
(Betweenes, PageRank, Degree, EigenVector, Degree). Several
groups of persons which are especially cohesive have also been
detected. These persons and groups had a decisive inﬂuence on
the results, particularly in the practical exercises. The forums
related to news and general questions as well as those which
refer to theorical contents presented less participation and com-
munities. All forums were characterized by a low minimum
distance between nodes, which facilitated the propagation of
the answers and solutions. The nodes also presented a high
average degree and assortativity. The obtained results show that
this methodology allows to analize the interacts that happen in
Virtual Educational Plaforms, which can help to improve the
learning contexts increasing the participation and involment of
the students.
This research can be continued by analyzing other topo-
logical parameters of the network. A study of the dynamical
behaviour (changes in topology and node status over the time)
can also be carried out.
