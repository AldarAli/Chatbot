Abstract—Advances in information and networking technology, 
in terms of online recreation, have continuously set an 
overwhelming pace for rapid growth in new applications of 
Internet-based activities in personal lives such as Blog.  The 
main purpose of this study is to explore whether chaos exists in 
the blog development and discover any particular point in time 
worth further discussion by conducting quantitative analysis of 
chaos theory in the time dimension. Given with emergent 
events that cause divergence and uncontrollable behavior, the 
results revealed that the development behaviors of popular 
blogs undergo dynamic evolution over time and the future 
development is uncertain and unpredictable.  
 
Keywords- Blog; Chaos theory; Lyapunov exponents

 INTRODUCTION  
Blogs evolved from the online diary owned by Justin Hall 
in 1994. In 2003 Google bought blogger.com. In 2005, Bill 
Gates, Chairman of Microsoft, pointed out that blog was 
one of the important network applications, while Business 
Week featured blog on its cover as the theme of its 2005 
Spring issue [1].  With the extensive use of blogs, more and 
more people became famous by writing articles or drawing 
comic strips on blogs. Popular blogs with huge numbers of 
daily visitors and responses often attract advertisers’ 
attention and the bloggers may be invited to give public 
speeches, publish books or appear on product promotion 
events; fame and fortune soon ensue. However, in one of the 
commentaries entitled "The Blogging Iceberg" provided by 
Peruses Development suggested that the majority of blogs 
only attracted a small number of readers, and often became 
inactive rather quickly [2]. The company conducted 
research on the blog population development in eight blog 
service providers in 2008 and found that 30% of the blogs 
were active for only one day, and up to 66% of the blogs 
were not updated for over two months. The average active 
period was 126 days overall [3]. This data shows that it is 
not an easy task to keep a blog over a long period of time. 
The existing theoretical models suggest that most of the 
studies on blog management tend to assume linear 
relationships among members interactions [4]. However, a 
closer observation found that blogs were an open platform, 
and some topics caused heated discussions through internal 
(bloggers, readers) and external (readers) interactions. These 
emergent events drew the blogs from stabilization to 
dissipation, which eventually returned to stabilization after a 
period of time until the next heated discussion began. The 
interactions in each phase also served as the feedback for 
the bloggers to post the next topic. It showed that blogs 
were a changing dynamic system [5], and there should be a 
theoretical framework different from linear relationships to 
explain the dynamic changes in blogs. Levy [6] proposed 
that Chaos Theory, derived from natural science, could be 
used to explain the unpredictable nature of social 
phenomena and to reveal the hidden pattern which changed 
over time. A number of scholars had also proposed the 
similar application of chaos theory in the enlightenment of 
social phenomena [7,8]. In addition, the existing literature 
[4,8] found that most research in blog behavior observation 
was confined to a fixed period, and only a few were 
longitudinal studies. If an observation is carried out within 
an extended period of time, the blog behavior changes over 
time can be tracked.  
Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to explore 
whether chaos exists in the blog development and discover 
any particular point in time worth further discussion by 
conducting quantitative analysis of chaos theory in the time 
dimension.  The results of this study should provide 
valuable insights for researchers who can improve 
techniques used in study for identifying exactly chaos 
situations.  It can also be helpful for managers who can 
better understand how to bridge the gap between demand for 
Blog users and to make advertising more effective to fulfill 
Blog users in a competitive era. 
 The paper is structured as follows: Section II presents a 
literature review in terms of blog and chaos theory.  Section 
III explains research model followed by Section IV, which 
uses Lyapunov exponent to identify the chaos exist or not.  
Finally, Section V concludes the paper and provides further 
discussions.

 LITERATURE REVIEW 
Justin Hall, a student at Swarthmore College, started his 
web-based diary in 1994 and was considered the earliest 
form of blog [9].  In July 1999 pitas.com released the first 
154

free and user-friendly blog software “pitas”, and launched 
blogger.com. It was a big deal when Google acquired 
blogger.com in 2003. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
introduced MSN Space blog with MSN integrated in 2003. 
Since then, Blog has been rapidly developed and spread on 
the internet [10]. 
Several researches have been conducted on blogging in 
different areas since blogs began gaining popularity in 2003. 
Trammell and Keshelashvili [11] found that many popular 
blogs were diary-type and often contain illustrated texts. 
Zhang [12] attempted to predict the sustainability of blogs 
with chaos theory. The research period spanned from the 
first day of the blog till the end of year 2006. He concluded 
that when the Lyapunov exponent decreased and the system 
became less chaotic, the bloggers should take the initiative 
to post new entries to improve the situation. Hsu and Lin 
[13] undertook research on acceptance of blog usage and 
found that perceived ease of use, entertainment, altruism, 
reputation, and community identification were important 
factors that influence the behavioral intention to adopt blog 
service.  
Chaos Theory, originated from Mathematics and Physics 
in the 1960 and 1970 [6], argued that the direct causal 
relationship proposed by the Newton theory in which it 
believed “one cause produced one result” was only a special 
case in the real world. Chaos theory proposed that nonlinear 
system was widespread in nature, included biological 
growth and fall of ethnic groups. In a dynamic system, 
objects were extremely simple in operation at the beginning, 
and unexpected results were produced with continuous 
duplications of the status in the previous phases by a certain 
rule over time [14]. 
Concomitant with the markedly increasing number of 
Blog users, it is not surprising that Blogs have garnered 
significant attention from the academic setting at large, from 
scholars in disciplines as diverse as sociology, psychology, 
education, and information systems to explore the potential 
research issues.  
In the field of finance, some scholars [15,16] used chaotic 
phenomena in well-log time series to analyze the changes in 
the United States Treasury bill rate and stock market price 
index. Their results confirmed that chaos theory was valid 
for explaining the real market situation. In information 
system based research, McBride [17] applied the concepts 
of initial condition, strange attractor and dissipative 
structure to interpret the interactions between the system 
and its members. Utilizing secondary data to review the 
revolution in monitor technology, Tu and Hung [18] applied 
chaos theory to explore the changing process of technical 
environment dynamic cycle.  
 
 
III.   RESEARCH METHOD 
This study presents the research model (Figure 1) that 
analyzes of blog data and that is used to identify whether 
chaos exists.    
 
 
Figure 1. Research model 
 
To investigate whether chaos exists in the most popular 
web blog, and to understand the driving events that cause 
chaos and its implications, we define “the most popular web 
blog” as “the blog which has the most visitors since the first 
day the blog”. The data is obtained from web site [19] 
which began tracking blog popularity and ranking blog 
growth in real time since September 2006 (Blog 
Observation System, 2009). As of June 2009 there were 
211,574 blogs on file. This study picked the top ranked 
Chinese personal blog Wan Wan’s Comic Blog as the 
research object (Blog Observation Chinese Personal Blog, 
2009). 
Identify suitable indicators for measuring the behavior of 
blog development, this study collected the information 
which is publicly available on the blog service website, 
including the number of entries, accounts and visitors as the 
indicators for measuring whether chaos exists during the 
course of the blog development, and analyzes the results to 
get the most discriminative indicator. For minimum sample 
size consideration, this study collects the data from the first 
day of the blog to the end of August 2009, and selects 
“week” as the appropriate time interval for the indicator 
analyses to meet the minimum sample size 200 required by 
Lyapunov exponent analysis [17]. Wan Wan’s Comic Blog 
began in October 2004. Totally, 256 sample data are 
collected for each indicator (October 2004 to August 2009, 
a total of 64 months. 64 * 4 = 256 samples) 
 
IV.  DATA ANALYSIS  
In line with above sense, the data was analyzed in two 
phases. The first phase calculated the total number of the 
entries, account numbers and visitors within one week. The 
number was used as  in phase two for the Lyapunov 
exponent calculation to determine whether each indicator 
denotes chaotic behavior. The raw data was collected from 
the entries on Wan Wan’s Comic Blog. The results of the 
Lyapunov exponent were shown in Fig.2 to Fig.4. Fig.2 was 
the  value for entry number. To meet the minimum 
155

requirement of sample number, the data was aggregated 
using one week as interval to minimize the difference in the 
number of entries for each week, which made the do or dn 
in the Lyapunov exponent equation  = LN(dn/do) to be 0 
and  to be undefined. Therefore it could not be used as an 
indicator of chaos. Fig.3 and Fig.4 showed the trend map 
using account numbers and visitors for further analysis. 
 
                    Figure 2.    value for entry number 
 
Kiel & Elliott [7] proposed in the chaos theory study that 
for any system if there was at least one positive value of, 
the system would have chaotic behavior, and the higher the 
value the greater the degree of chaos. The results from the 
Lyapunov exponent find that for both the account numbers 
and visitors, the  values were greater than 0 during the 
period 2004/12/23 to 2009/4/21 (Fig.3 and Fig.4). Since 
there was at least one positive  value, it could be assumed 
that chaotic behavior existed in the system. The result is 
shown in Table 2.  
The analysis of Lyapunov exponent in Table 2 showed 
that the results of testing chaos using account numbers and 
visitors are quite consistent. During the period 2004/10/5 – 
2004/12/22 the  values were less than 0, which meant the 
blog was stable without chaotic behavior. However, during 
the period 2004/12/23 – 2009/4/21 there was at least one  
value greater than 0, which meant chaos existed in the blog 
development and the development had become uncertain 
and unpredictable.  
According to Hilborn [20] the subsystems were formed 
with different initial values, we could further understand the 
extent of chaos in certain intervals by the  values. To 
better observe the chaotic behavior in the system the study 
uses “one year” as the time interval and observes the 
changes of the   values in each interval to understand the 
changes in chaos each year. The reason for selecting one 
year as the interval was to avoid the low number of entries 
and critical events in a short period of time. Table 3 and 
Fig.5 showed the  values of account numbers and visitors 
in each year. 
Table 3 used account numbers as an indicator for chaos 
and showed that the   value before 2004/12/22 was less 
than 0 (   =-0.440); this meant chaotic behavior did not 
exist during the development. However, the values moved 
from negative to positive in 2005-2009 and went up 
increasingly, which meant that chaos existed in the blog 
development and the extent of chaos was becoming more 
significant. The value was highest in 2008, indicating there 
was a critical event worth attention during this period. 
However, the value in 2009 decreased slightly compared to 
2008. It might be attributed to the requirements for 
Lyapunov exponent calculation. The data collecting stopped 
at the end of April 2009, which affected the   value for 
the year 2009. The analysis result of the   value for 
visitors was consistent with that for account numbers.    
Table 2 and Table 3 both revealed that the identification 
of chaos using account numbers and visitors is consistent 
with both one year or the entire period as an interval, which 
meant both indicators were valid in identifying chaos. The 
change in  value each year showed that blog development 
involved both positive and negative forces. The negative 
force led the system to a stable status, and with certain 
events the system diverged from stability. Table 3 showed 
the   value changed from negative to positive at the end of 
2004 to 2005. The positive force led the system away from 
stability to chaotic behavior.      
In this section we adopted the chaotic behavior - time 
matrix to express chaos in blog development. (Fig.6)  
 
Figure 6. Chaotic behavior-time matrix 
 
The Lyapunov exponent analysis showed that both 
positive and negative feedback forces existed in the blog 
development process. The positive feedback force meant the 
system was chaotic, divergent, and was unpredictable and 
difficult to explain. The negative feedback force meant the 
system was stable and seeking internal development and 
recognition. The system was relatively closed. In the initial 
stage the blog was not well-known and only attracted a few 
visitors, therefore the   value prior to 2004/12/22 was 
smaller than zero, meaning chaos did not exist and the blog 
was stable and convergent. The system underwent a

transition from non-chaotic to chaotic on 2004/12/23. The  
values from 2005 through 2009 were greater than zero and 
were steadily increasing; indicating critical events existed 
during these periods and led the system to go from the state 
of equilibrium to disorder.    
 
V.  CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The main purpose of the study is to explore whether 
chaos exists during blog development and find out the 
timing when this behavior occurs. The results show that the 
non-linear and dynamic chaos does exist during the course 
of the blog development and there exists both positive and 
negative forces in the system. Basically, the negative force 
leads the blog towards stability and convergence, and during 
this period the blog seeks readers’ recognition and cohesion. 
Critical events bring in the external energy and resources, 
which causes internal and external interactions under the 
dissipative structure of the system. In contrast, the positive 
force therefore leads the system to move from the state of 
stability towards disturbance, divergence and disorder and 
makes the situation difficult to predict and control. The time, 
chaos occurs, is when Lyapunvo exponent turns from 
negative to positive. This is the demarcation of ordered 
structure and disorder, meaning there’re emergent events 
that cause divergence and uncontrollable behavior. These 
are events that require discussion to understand the 
applications of the quantitative data. The demarcation of the 
negative force and positive force is on December 23rd 2004 
when MSN emoticons are released. The blog goes into a 
state of chaos and unpredictable situation. In addition, 
the  values for accounting numbers/visitors (Fig.4) from 
the result of quantitative data analysis show that 
the  values have increased over the years since the 
demarcation and reached the highest number in 2008, 
meaning the degree of chaos disturbance peaks in 2008  
The chaotic behavior - time matrix (Figure 6) shows that 
under 
the 
operation 
of 
self-organization 
feedback 
mechanism, the blog develops diversely and grows 
continuously. Although the blog features the blogger’s 
personal style and taste, it needs to be further extended and 
broadened to attract more visitors. From a commercial 
viewpoint, specific topics are needed to generate discussion, 
however in addition to the linear thinking where cause and 
effect have a direct relationship, it should be noted that 
small cause may also bring large effects.  Finally, the virtual 
online community is not sufficient, face-to-face interactions 
also help boost popularity. The update on the blog finds 
heated discussion after the Wan Wan’s first face-to-face 
interaction with the fans.
