Abstract—In this paper, we propose a Countrywide 
Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) Spectrum Allocation and Reuse 
(CoMSAR) technique to allocate and reuse spatially the 
countrywide massive 28 GHz mmWave spectrum to each Mobile 
Network Operator (MNO) to operate its small cells per floor in a 
multistory 
building. 
A 
frequency-domain 
interference 
management scheme is developed, and the optimal amount of 
spectrum for each MNO is deduced to avoid Co-Channel 
Interference (CCI) at the presence of User Equipments (UEs) of 
multiple MNOs on each floor. We derive average capacity, 
Spectral Efficiency (SE), Energy Efficiency (EE), and Cost 
Efficiency (CE) for CoMSAR. Extensive numerical and simulation 
results and analyses are carried out for an example scenario of a 
country consisting of four MNOs, i.e., MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, 
and MNO 4 with a subscriber base of, respectively, 40%, 30%, 
20%, and 10% of the total countrywide subscribers. It is shown 
for MNO 1 that the proposed technique can improve average 
capacity, SE, EE, and CE by 300%, 165%, 75%, and 60%, 
respectively, with no CCI, whereas 60%, 6%, 37%, and 0.4%, 
respectively, with the maximum CCI. Further, we show that 
CoMSAR can satisfy the SE and EE requirements for sixth-
generation (6G) mobile systems by reusing the countrywide 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum to small cells of MNO 1 of about 60% 
less number of floors with no CCI, whereas 3.3% less number of 
floors with the maximum CCI, in a building.

I. INTRODUCTION 
      The high capacity and data rates requirements for the 
existing mobile networks impose a demand for the massive 
radio spectrum availability on a Mobile Network Operator 
(MNO). Though these requirements have been increased over 
time, the availability of the spectrum for an MNO has not 
increased correspondingly, resulting in the scarcity of the radio 
spectrum. In this regard, spectrum allocation and spectrum 
exploitation can play a vital role in addressing the spectrum 
scarcity for an MNO in a country. By carefully allocating the 
spectrum specified for a country among its MNOs, the available 
amount of spectrum for an MNO can be extended considerably. 
Furthermore, by exploiting the available spectrum for an MNO 
in space, for example, the utilization of the spectrum can be 
increased. Accordingly, the spatial reuse of the spectrum to 
small cells, particularly in a 3-Dimensional (3D) space, e.g. a 
multistory building, is considered as an effective approach to 
increase the utilization of the available spectrum.  
      Numerous research works have already addressed the issues 
of spectrum allocation [1]-[3], as well as spectrum exploitation 
[4]-[6]. For example, Yan et al. [1] have proposed methods for 
the dynamic spectrum allocation in cognitive radio systems. 
Kim et al. [2] have introduced the functionalities required for 
entities related to the spectrum allocation to propose a spectrum 
allocation algorithm in multiple network operators’ scenario. 
Moreover, Kim et al. [3] have introduced and formulated the 
problem of the optimum spectrum allocation in cognitive 
radios. Besides, regarding the spectrum exploitation by means 
of reusing the available spectrum, Saha and Aswakul [4] have 
proposed an analytical model to reuse the spectrum in a 3D 
building of small cells. Likewise, Saquib et al. [5] have 
investigated a number of Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) 
schemes. Moreover, Saha [6] has proposed a technique to reuse 
the same spectrum by small cells deployed in a building by 
forming 3D clusters of small cells. 
      However, unlike the traditional static licensed spectrum 
allocation that considers allocating a certain portion of the 
countrywide spectrum to an MNO, the whole countrywide 
Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) spectrum can be allocated to each 
MNO to increase its spectrum. Besides, due to the high floor 
penetration loss, the same countrywide mmWave spectrum for 
each MNO can be exploited spatially in the inter-floor level to 
reuse it more than once by small cells within a building. Hence, 
a technique that can employ both the spectrum allocation and 
spectrum exploitation means to the mmWave spectrum using 
in-building small cells to allocate the countrywide mmWave 
spectrum to each MNO, which is exploited further to be 
spatially reused by small cells in a building is considered 
promising to achieve high Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Energy 
Efficiency (EE) requirements for the next generation mobile 
networks.  
      Numerous studies have already attempted to achieve the 
expected SE and EE requirements for the Sixth-Generation 
(6G) mobile networks by employing the mmWave spectrum 
allocation and exploitation. For example, by exploiting the 
power-domain, Saha [7] has proposed a hybrid interweave–
underlay spectrum access and reuse technique to address the 
dynamic spectrum access and reuse of the countrywide 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum to in-building small cells of each MNO in 
a country to achieve the required SE and EE of 6G. Unlike the 
countrywide mmWave spectrum, by exploiting the secondary 
spectrum trading, Saha [8] has proposed a dynamic exclusive-
use spectrum access method to share partly and exclusively the 
licensed mmWave spectrum of one MNO to another in a 
country to address the SE and EE requirements for 6G. Further, 
Saha [9] has presented a technique for the 3D spatial reuse of

28 and 60 GHz mmWave spectra allocated to an MNO to its in-
building small cells to achieve the expected SE and EE 
requirements for 6G networks. 
      Unlike these existing literature works, in this paper, by 
exploiting the frequency-domain, we propose A Countrywide 
MmWave Spectrum Allocation and Reuse (CoMSAR) 
technique that considers allocating and then reusing the massive 
28 GHz mmWave spectrum specified countrywide to each 
MNO of a country to operate its small cells deployed on each 
floor in a multistory building to achieve the expected SE and 
EE requirements for 6G mobile networks. In addressing the 
proposed technique, we first present the system architecture and 
the proposed technique, as well as develop a frequency-domain 
Co-Channel Interference (CCI) avoidance scheme, in Section 
II. In Section III, we derive average capacity, SE, EE, and CE 
metrics for the proposed technique. In Section IV, extensive 
numerical and simulation results and analyses for an example 
scenario of a country consisting of four MNOs is carried out 
under two extreme CCI scenarios, including no CCI and the 
maximum CCI, for an MNO to show that the proposed 
technique can achieve the SE and EE requirements for 6G 
mobile systems. We conclude the paper in Section V. A list of 
acronyms/abbreviations is shown in Table I and a list of 
selected notations is given in Table II.  
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 
A. System Architecture 
Figure 1 shows the system architecture consisting of four 
MNOs, defined as MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, and MNO 4, 
operating in a country. We assume that all MNOs have similar 
system architectural features including three types of Base 
Stations (BSs), namely macrocell BSs (MBSs), Picocell BSs 
(PBSs), and Small Cell BSs (SBSs). Hence, for simplicity in 
evaluating the performances, the detailed architecture of only 
one MNO, i.e., MNO 1, is shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). SBSs 
are deployed only within 3-dimensional multistory buildings 
each serving one User Equipment (UE) at a time (Figure 1(d)). 
Both SBSs and PBSs are located within the coverage of an 
MBS. All macrocell UEs per MBS are served either by the 
MBS itself or any PBSs. Due to the favorable characteristics, 
MBSs and PBSs operate at a low-frequency band, i.e., 2 GHz, 
whereas all in-building SBSs operate at the 28 GHz mmWave 
band (Figure 1(a)). 
We consider that each MNO is given access to the 
countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum to extend its spectrum 
at all times by enforcing the frequency-domain CCI 
management, as shown in Figure 1(d). Given that CCI for an 
MNO o increases with an increase in the number of UEs of 
other MNOs O\o (Figure 1(c) for MNO 1), Figure 1(d) shows 
two extreme CCI scenarios for small cells of MNO 1 on a floor 
based on the presence of UEs of other MNOs O\o within the 
same floor of a building. For simplicity, CCI scenarios are 
shown for a single small cell in an apartment on a floor. 
Besides, the penetration loss of a typical reinforced concrete 
floor in the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum is about 55 dB for the 
first floor [10]-[12]. Hence, by exploiting the high floor 
penetration loss of 28 GHz mmWave spectrum, on top of the 
spectrum extension by allocating the countrywide massive 28 
GHz spectrum to each MNO, we consider the spectrum 
exploitation by reusing the same countrywide spectrum to SBSs 
of each MNO on each floor of a building to increase spectral 
utilization (Figures 1(b) and 1(d)). We propose a technique for 
the spectrum allocation and the spectrum exploitation of the 
countrywide 28 GHz spectrum to each MNO in what follows.  
B. Proposed Technique   
We propose a countrywide mmWave spectrum allocation 
and reuse (CoMSAR) technique to extend the available 
spectrum for an MNO and to increase its utilization as follows. 
Each MNO of a country is assigned with the massive 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum specified countrywide, which is reused 
further, to operate its small cells deployed on each floor in a 
building at the cost of paying the spectrum licensing fee subject 
to avoiding CCI. The amount of the spectrum licensing fee for 
an MNO is updated corresponding to the change in its number 
of subscribers at each license renew term 
trnw
.  
      In this regard, for the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum 
allocation, each MNO is allocated to the countrywide 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum by the National Regulatory Agency (NRA) 
or any third-party for a term 
trnw
. For the 28 GHz mmWave 
spectrum reuse, each MNO can exploit the high floor 
penetration loss of a multistory building at mmWave such that 
the allocated countrywide full 28 GHz mmWave spectrum can 
be reused to its SBSs deployed on each floor (Figure 1(b)) due 
to the insignificant or no CCI generated between SBSs on 
adjacent floors. This results in reusing the allocated 
countrywide spectrum to an MNO more than once to its SBSs 
within a multistory building and, hence, in improving the 
countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum utilization.   
      Each MNO pays the licensing fee to the NRA, which is 
defined by the administration based on the ratio of its actual 
number of subscribers to the sum of the total number of 
subscribers of all MNOs countrywide at
trnw
. Hence, the 
proposed technique can help overcome the lack of a sufficient 
amount of spectrum of an MNO to serve the necessary demand 
of its users, as well as address the issue of the under-utilized or 
unused spectrum of other MNOs, which in turn improve the 
overall countrywide spectrum utilization. Moreover, an MNO 
pays the licensing fee only for the amount of spectrum that it 
uses at any term 
trnw
(i.e., in accordance with its number of 
users). 
C. Interference Management  
Since all MNOs consider operating in-building small cells 
at the same countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum, CCI 
occurs when small cell UEs of more than one MNO on the same 
floor in a building are scheduled to the same frequency 
simultaneously. Such CCI can be avoided by allocating UEs 
orthogonally in the frequency-domain [13]. More specifically, 
UEs of MNOs located on the same floor in a building are 
allocated orthogonally to different parts of the countrywide 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum, as shown in Figure 2. Hence, UEs of 
not more than one MNO can be allocated to the same frequency 
in any Transmission Time Interval (TTI). The existence of an

. Note that the radio spectrum 
is not free of cost. Hence, licensing more spectrum causes an 
increase in the cost of an MNO. Moreover, as the total amount 
of the spectrum specified for a country is fixed, licensing more 
spectrum by one MNO causes the scarcity of the required 
spectrum by another MNO in a country, resulting in degrading 
the quality-of-service (QoS). This problem can be addressed if 
each MNO takes the license of the amount of the spectrum as 
low as possible corresponding to its actual number of 
subscribers so that the issue of the under-utilized or unused 
spectrum by one MNO, as well as the lack of a sufficient 
amount of spectrum for another MNO to serve its necessary 
user demand can be addressed. Since each MNO favors to 
minimizing the cost of licensing spectrum while ensuring to 
serve its user demands adequately to retain QoS, we consider a 
minimization problem for allocating the countrywide mmWave 
spectrum to each MNO to increase the overall countrywide 
mmWave spectrum utilization. Hence, the optimal amount of

III. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Let SM,o denote the number of macrocells, and SP,o denotes 
the number of picocells per macrocell of an MNO o.  Also, let 
T denote the simulation run time with the maximum time of Q 
(in time step each lasting 1 ms) such that T= {1, 2, 3,…,Q}. Let
MC
P
,
PC
P
, and 
SC
P
denote, respectively, the transmission 
power of a macrocell, a picocell, and a small cell of an MNO o. 
Using Shannon’s capacity formula, a link throughput at RB=i 
in TTI=t for an MNO o at rnw
t
in bps per Hz is given by [14][15]

and a low transmission power of an SBS, we assume similar 
indoor signal propagation characteristics for all L buildings per 
macrocell for an MNO o at rnw

Assume that an MNO o pays the spectrum licensing fee of

a simulator that is built by using the default instruction sets of 
the computational tool MATLAB R2012b version running on a 
personal computer. Further, the algorithm used to generate the 
performance results is given in Algorithm 1. The performance 
of the proposed technique is evaluated with regard to the 
traditional SLSA technique. We assume that MNO 1, MNO 2,

Using (20)-(23), the performance of the proposed technique is 
evaluated for MNO 1 under two extreme scenarios, including 
when no CCI occurs due to the absence of UEs of all other 
MNOs O\o=1, and when the maximum CCI occurs due to the 
presence of at least a UE of each MNO of O\o=1 on a floor in 
a building. With no CCI, the whole countrywide mmWave 
spectrum, whereas with the maximum CCI, only 40% of the 
countrywide spectrum, can be allocated to SBSs of MNO 1 in 
all TTIs. Since the achievable capacity depends directly on the 
amount of spectrum, the maximum average capacity, SE, EE, 
and CE for MNO 1 can be achieved with no CCI, as shown in 
Figure 3(a), in contrast to that with the maximum CCI, shown 
in Figure 3(b).  Specifically, with regard to the traditional 
SLSA, the proposed technique improves the average capacity, 
SE, EE, and CE by 300%, 165%, 75%, and 60%, respectively 
with no CCI, whereas only 60%, 6%, 37%, and 0.4%, 
respectively with the maximum CCI.  
      Moreover, Figure 3 shows that the proposed technique with 
no CCI provides 2.5 times higher average capacity, SE, EE, and 
CE performances than that with the maximum CCI.  Hence, 
CCI plays a vital role in the overall performances of an MNO

when allocated to the countrywide spectrum. Now, using (10) -
(12) for the proposed technique and (14) -(16) for the traditional 
SLSA technique, Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the effect of 
reusing the same countrywide spectrum to each floor of SBSs 
of MNO 1 in a multistory building. As can be seen from Figure 
4, with an increase in the number of floors, SE increases 
linearly, whereas EE increases negative exponentially, 
irrespective of the degree of CCI. Further, since SE is affected 
additionally by the optimal amount of countrywide spectrum, 
the proposed technique with the maximum CCI provides 
insignificant SE while noticeable EE improvement over the 
traditional SLSA technique because of its higher average 
capacity performance, as shown in Figure 3(b). 
B. Performance Comparison   
      Future 6G mobile systems are expected to require 10 times 
average SE (i.e., 270-370 bps/Hz), as well as 10 times average 
EE (i.e., 0.3×10-6 Joules/bit) [22] [23], of 5G mobile systems 
[24] [25]. Now, using Figure 4, it can be seen that the proposed 
CoMSAR can satisfy both the SE of 370 bps/Hz and EE of 0.3 
µJ/bit for 6G mobile systems by reusing the countrywide 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum to small cells of MNO 1 of about 60% 
less number of floors (i.e., 
FL
=12) with no CCI, whereas 3.3% 
less number of floors (i.e., 
FL
=29) with the maximum CCI, 
than that required by the traditional SLSA technique (i.e.,
FL

=30) in a multistory building.  
C. Offered Benefits and Implementation Complexity 
The proposed technique benefits from the following. It 
ensures the availability of a large amount of spectrum by 
allocating the countrywide full (instead of a portion) mmWave 
spectrum to each MNO. Further, it provides an efficient 
spectrum utilization by allowing each MNO dynamic and 
flexible (instead of static and dedicated) access to the 
countrywide spectrum. Furthermore, it allows an MNO to pay 
only for the amount of spectrum that it uses to serve its user 
demands (i.e., in proportionate with the number of its users) at 
39

any term trnw, resulting in reducing the cost per unit capacity 
(i.e., bps).   
However, the implementation of the proposed technique 
warrants from the following issues, including updating the 
dynamic usage of the countrywide spectrum on each floor by 
UEs of different MNOs and enforcing CCI management. In this 
regard, SBSs of each MNO per floor can keep sensing using 
either a reactive or proactive approach to detect the status of the 
shared full countrywide spectrum usage and coordinate with 
SBSs of other MNOs on the same floor to update the CCI status 
and amount of the shared spectrum usage for each MNO. 
However, such coordination among SBSs of different MNOs 
generates a huge amount of control signaling overheads 
depending on the size of the group of the coordinated SBSs. 
The larger the size of the group of the coordinated SBSs, the 
greater the amount of generated control signaling overheads, as 
well as delay in updating the CCI status.  
In general, coordination among SBSs can be done centrally 
or in a distributed manner. Central coordination of SBSs per 
building, for example, can contribute to achieving a global 
optimization in updating the CCI status and the corresponding 
spectrum allocation to each MNO. This, however, comes at the 
cost of generating high control signaling overheads. On the 
other hand, by limiting the size of a coordinated group of SBSs, 
control signaling overheads due to the coordination can be kept 
limited. This, however, comes at the cost of allowing a local 
optimization in updating the CCI status and the corresponding 
allocated spectrum to each MNO. Hence, a tradeoff between the 
optimal performance in the CCI and scheduled spectrum status 
updates per MNO and the generated control signaling overhead 
due to the coordination needs to be achieved, which asks for 
further studies. We consider this issue as part of our future 
research studies. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a countrywide millimeter-
wave (mmWave) spectrum allocation and reuse (CoMSAR) 
technique that considers assigning each MNO with the massive 
28 GHz mmWave spectrum countrywide at the cost of paying 
the spectrum licensing fee subject to avoiding co-channel 
interference (CCI). The assigned spectrum to each MNO is 
reused further to operate its small cells deployed on each floor 
in a multistory building. The amount of the spectrum licensing 
fee for an MNO is updated in accordance with its number of 
subscribers at each license renew term. Moreover, CCI has been 
avoided by developing a frequency-domain CCI avoidance 
scheme that allocates UEs of different MNOs on any floor of a 
building orthogonally to the countrywide 28 GHz mmWave 
spectrum. We have derived average capacity, Spectral 
Efficiency (SE), Energy Efficiency (EE), and Cost Efficiency 
(CE) metrics for the proposed technique. Extensive numerical 
and simulation results and analyses have been carried out for an 
example scenario of a country consisting of four MNOs, i.e., 
MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, and MNO 4 with the number of 
subscribers of 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the total number of 
subscribers of all MNOs, respectively.  
It has been shown for MNO 1 that, for a single building of 
small cells, the proposed technique can improve the average 
capacity, SE, EE, and CE performances by 300%, 165%, 75%, 
and 60%, respectively with no CCI, whereas 60%, 6%, 37%, 
and 0.4%, respectively with the maximum CCI, as compared to 
that of the traditional Static Licensed Spectrum Allocation 
(SLSA) technique. Finally, we have shown that the proposed 
CoMSAR technique can satisfy the SE and EE requirements for 
6G mobile systems by reusing the countrywide 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum to small cells of MNO 1 of about 60% less 
number of floors with no CCI, whereas 3.3% less number of 
floors with the maximum CCI, than that required by the 
traditional SLSA technique in a multistory building.  
So far, in this paper, we have restricted investigating the 
proposed countrywide mmWave spectrum allocation and reuse 
technique to indoor SBSs deployed in multistory buildings. 
However, the propagation characteristics of mmWave signals 
in outdoor environments differ greatly from that in indoor one, 
particularly, rain and atmospheric absorption effect, cell 
coverage, shadowing effect from large buildings, outage 
probability, user density, and speed, and mobility and handover 
management. All these aspects have a significant impact on the 
allocation and reuse of the mmWave spectrum outdoors. Hence, 
how to allocate the countrywide mmWave spectrum to each 
MNO without causing CCI to each other and reuse the same 
mmWave spectrum for an MNO spatially need considerable 
research works. We aim to address these issues, i.e., mmWave 
spectrum allocation and reuse, in outdoor environments in our 
future research studies.
