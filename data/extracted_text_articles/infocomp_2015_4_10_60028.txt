Abstract— Most research in the field of writer identification 
currently uses positional data to identify the writer. But there 
is no writer identification method that is suitable for practical 
use so far. So, we newly devise two algorithms to raise 
accuracy rate and find some parameters that have beneficial 
effects on writer identification. One algorithm is “Block Type 
Model” which is a method to analyze positional relation and 
shapes of Chinese characters. The other algorithm is “Hidden 
feature analysis” which is an algorithm that identifies the 
writer using multi-parameters with all the strokes. As a result, 
any eight Chinese characters were enough to achieve over 
99.9% accuracy rate. Additionally, we discovered that there 
are personal attributes in the speed of each stroke. With the 
new algorithm, we raised accuracy rate and found out that 
parameters have beneficial effects on writer identification.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Hand-written characters contain unique characteristics 
of people. Recently, what is most desired in the field of 
handwriting analysis is a proposal of a method or 
algorithm with an accuracy which is higher than or 
equivalent to the fingerprint authentication system or the 
vein authentication system. 
To identify the characteristics of the writer, many 
algorithms have been proposed, but their identification 
success rate is not at the level of practical use. The biggest 
reason is that the amount of information obtained from the 
position of dots and lines is not sufficient to identify the 
writer. 
The methods to extract characteristics of the writer from 
the limited information can be divided into two main 
categories. One is known and described as an “Intra” type. 
This type verifies the shape of a line of characters or the 
position among radicals. The other is called as an “Inter” 
type, which verifies the shape of every part of characters 
(e.g., distance between each stroke). Using the two 
methods is expected to bring higher accuracy.  
Edge-Based Directional Features, connected-component 
contours and other methods have been invented in previous 
works. Off-line means the samples were collected from 
papers or by some analog method. On-line means the 
samples were collected from tablets or by some digital 
method. Number of characters means how many characters 
were necessary for matching. 
Many algorithms analyze the position information of 
lines or points, and extract individual features. However, 
there are few methods that analyze the pen pressure, stroke 
speed and an inclination angle of a pen. Moreover, there are 
few databases which contain huge amount of location data. 
Therefore, we newly devised two algorithms. One is an 
“Inter” type algorithm which uses the relationship among 
block such as radicals. The other is an “Intra” type 
algorithm with position data, pen pressure, speed data, and 
an inclination angle of a pen, an angular difference between 
paper and pen. Then, we combine these two methods and do 
an experiment using the database that we have been creating 
for over five years. The database currently contains 110 
kinds of Chinese characters, written by 48 writers of 
different nationalities, 10 times each, adding up to 52,800 
characters in total. In this research, half of the characters 
were used to extract the characteristics of the writers, and 
the other half was used for an identification experiment. The 
results indicate that features extracted from eight Chinese 
characters were enough to identify the writer.  In Section 2 
we show the approaches for writer identification. In Section 
3 we show the experiment and results. In Section 4 we show 
the discussions. In Section 5 we conclude the paper. 
 
II. 
WRITER IDENTIFICATION APPROACHES 
In this section, we present an algorithm for writer 
identification using the Block Type Model, Hidden Feature 
Analysis. 
A. Initialization 
To identify the writer who has written Chinese characters, 
we used a database that contains positional data, pen 
pressure, inclination angle of the pen, angular difference 
between paper and pen, and pen speed. When we collected 
character data, we had no idea how to standardize the size of 
characters. In this research, we have to standardize the size 
of characters for matching. First we computed the average 
size of all the characters in the database for Dynamic Time 
Warping (DTW) matching. Then, we used it as the standard 
size of characters. However, since there are vertically long 
and horizontally long types in Chinese characters, expansion 
and reduction cannot be simply performed in every direction 
by the same ratio. Therefore, we distinguished the 
characters of a vertically long or horizontally long type. We 
divided the Chinese characters into two or more blocks: a 
radical block and another block. In the case of a Chinese 
character with two or more radicals, we added the number 
of blocks as radical block.

We further classified them according to the direction of 
vectors between the two most distant blocks. If the vector 
pointed sideways, we posited it as a horizontally long type 
character. If the vector was vertical, we posited it as a 
vertically long type. In particular, we used the expressions 
below for making judgements. 
The relation between the lengthwise direction of the 
interior of characters can be an important factor for a 
vertically long type of character, and the relation between 
the crosswise direction of the interior of characters can be 
an important factor for a horizontally long type of character. 
So, we resized characters according to the type of character 
(horizontally long or vertically long). If the character was 
vertically long, we resized it with the ratio of the lengthwise 
direction of the standard.  If the character was horizontally 
long, we resized it with the ratio of the crosswise direction 
of the standard; we did not change the vertical ratio of 
vertically long type characters or the horizontal ratio of 
horizontally long type characters in Figure 1.  
B. Block Type Model 
As previously noted, our research attempts to combine an 
inter-type algorithm, the Block Type Model, with an intra-
type algorithm, Hidden Feature Analysis.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. A character is divided into some blocks. 
2. The points that contain the maximum X-coordinate, the 
minimum X-coordinate, the maximum Y-coordinate, 
and the minimum Y-coordinate of each block are 
recorded. 
3. The average of points of the same kind of character 
written by the same writers is computed. Then it is 
defined as a class of writer (e.g., Writer A's character B 
class) 
4. The points of characters and points of classes are 
compared according to the Euclidean distance and 
weight (it should be defined as an approximate value). 
Then the class of the best approximation of the 
character is identified. 
5. The class with the lowest approximate value is 
determined as the writer's class. 
Weights are decided with the rule stated below. 
 
Weight = Average of variance of each point / Variance of 
each point. 
 
The approximate value is defined by the equation below 
number of characters. 
A=E*W 
 
where, A, E, and W is approximate value, Euclidean 
distance between each pair of points, and weight of each 
point, respectively. 
In other words, higher variance means a lower 
approximate value. To put it another way, lower variance 
means a higher approximate value. A graphic explanation is 
given in Figure 2. In Figure 2, points A, B, C, D, and so on 
mean the points that have the maximum X-coordinate and 
Y-coordinate and minimum X-coordinate and Y-coordinate.

We only show the results of the Block Type Model 
(Table 1), “No. of char.” means the number of Chinese 
characters used for matching. 
This experiment was conducted using 110 kinds of 
Chinese characters written by 48 writers. One writer wrote 
10 times each character. Namely, we collected 52800 
characters in total. This experiment was conducted with 1 to 
10 characters chosen randomly from the database, 
calculating the distance between the class and the character 
for each character. We used the sum total of the 
approximate values to identify the writer. Then, we repeated 
this 1000 times.  We obtain the  results of the average. 
 
C. Hidden feature Analysis 
This is an algorithm that identifies the writer using the 
average of pen pressure, the inclination angle of the pen, the 
angular difference between paper and pen, and the speed 
and range of these parameters in each stroke. The Hidden 
Feature Analysis was carried out as below. 
1.  Characters were divided into strokes. 
2.  The average of pen pressure, inclination angle of the pen, 
angular difference between paper and pen, and speed 
and range of these parameters in each stroke were 
computed. Then, we defined the character as a class of 
writer (e.g., Writer A's character B class) 
3.  We compare the written characters with class.  (It was 
defined as an approximate value.)  
Then, we identified the class of the best approximation 
to the character. (The class with the lowest approximate 
value was determined to be the writer's class.) 
 Graphic explanation is given in Figure 1. The results of 
experiment with an individual parameter without its weight 
are found in Table 2.  
In Figure 3, “pressure” and “speed” mean the pen 
pressure and speed of each stroke respectively. Theta is the 
inclination angle of the pen. “Phi” is the angular difference 
between paper and pen. The horizontal axis corresponds to 
the number of characters used for the analysis and the 
vertical axis corresponds to the correct rate.  
The result shows that there is a difference in matching 
performance among the parameters. Then the average 
accuracy of each parameter is computed (Table 3). 
We defined the average of the overall parameters as the 
standard and used the rule below to decide the weights.  
 
Average of accuracy of each parameter / 
Average of accuracy of all parameter 
 
The weight of each parameter is given in Table 3. In 
other words, we used the weight to improve the influence 
of the parameters that were performing well and also to 
lessen the influence of the parameters that were not 
performing so well. 
The results of the combination of the Block Type Model 
and Hidden Feature Analysis are given later. Here we only 
show the results of the Hidden Feature Analysis (Table 5). 
“Hidden feature” means the accuracy rate without the 
weight. “Hidden feature with weight” means the accuracy 
with the weight.  
This experiment was conducted with 1 to 10 characters 
which were chosen randomly from the database, 
calculating the distance between the class and the character 
for each character. We used the sum total of the 
approximate values to identify the writer. Then, we 
repeated this 1000 times. We obtained the results of the 
average.

MAIN EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS 
We describe the results of two experiments: (1) an inter-
type Block Type Model and (2) an intra-type Hidden 
Feature Analysis. Now, we combine these two methods 
and carry out the experiment. In particular, we summed up

the two methods' approximate values and appointed the 
class that had the lowest approximate value as the writer's 
class.  
This experiment was conducted using 110 kinds of 
Chinese characters written by 48 writers. Each writer 
wrote each character 10 times. Namely, we collected 
52800 characters in total. 
Comprehensive results are given in Table 5. This 
experiment was conducted with 1 to 10 characters chosen 
randomly from the database, and the distance between the 
class and the character was calculated for each character. 
We used the sum total of the approximate values to 
identify the writer. Then, we repeated this 1000 times. We 
obtained the results of the average. Additionally, the ratio 
of approximate values of the two algorithms is set to 1:1. 
There are some researches similar to our research [4] 
and [5]. Our database is smaller than that used in [5], but 
we can achieve a higher accuracy rate with a smaller 
number of characters. We can achieve 90% accuracy with 
one character, while [5] needed 50 words. Moreover, we 
can achieve a higher accuracy rate than [4] in the same 
situation. Their accuracy was 97.5%. But our maximum 
accuracy rate is 99.9%.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented novel two algorithms to 
improve the accuracy rate and find some parameters that 
have beneficial effects on writer identification. The results 
indicate that four Chinese characters were enough to 
achieve an accuracy rate of 99% and eight Chinese 
characters were enough to achieve an accuracy rate of over 
99.9%. Table 5 indicates that the accuracy rate of the two 
methods combined is higher than the results of the two 
individual approaches. This means that this method is quite 
useful for identifying the writer. 
Our algorithm does not support one-to-many matching. 
This means that when we identify the writer, the written 
Chinese character must be the same kind as was written at 
the time of class generation. In the future, we hope to be 
able to generate a class that can support more Chinese 
characters with a small number of characters..
