Abstract—The research presented in this paper concentrates on
the results from creating new advanced methodologies used for
enhancing knowledge resources and knowledge mining. Creating
and developing advanced knowledge resources and features for
mining over long-time periods are challenging tasks, which
require the continuous development of advanced complex means.
Enhancements have to include semi-manual and automatable
implementations from advanced methodologies in order to
access the knowledge- and context-related characteristics and
context values. This research builds on the practice of creation
and development of multi-disciplinary knowledge resources for
decades and creating and applying mining and discovery methods.
The results on creating means for a comparative analysis of data
entities from knowledge resources are used for data analysis
and enhancement of complex and increasing multi-disciplinary
knowledge resources. Comparing data entities is a most ambitious
task for increasingly complex data objects, integrated resources,
and relations – from the Knowledge Resources, as well as
from the computational perspective. The implementation utilises
complementary components, which enable to structure and
describe complex knowledge and support an advanced analysis.
Based on the methodological fundament, the paper presents
practical results, delivers and discusses instructive examples from
an implementation and case study. For practical reasons with the
comparative analysis, the knowledge resources explicitly utilise
references to publicly available data resources. The goal of
this research is the enhancement of knowledge resources and
mining by modular implementations of advanced methodologies,
especially method integration for comparative analysis and
knowledge mining with information systems and long-term multi-
disciplinary knowledge resources.

INTRODUCTION
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that knowledge and
knowledge-related data are core values of human activities.
Knowledge and long-term knowledge resources are treasure
troves of documentation and sources of major insights. The
enhancement of knowledge resources and documentation also
contributes to new discovery and insights. Therefore, new
advanced methods need to be created contributing to the devel-
opment and enhancement of knowledge resources. The funda-
ments of the method providing a Comparative Analysis of data
entities were presented at the INFOCOMP 2017 conference
in Venice, Italy [1]. This paper presents results of extended
research, which showed to be relevant for the enhancement
of knowledge resources and mining and discovery processes.
The enhancements include further aspects for integration of
resources, the integration of conceptual knowledge, the ar-
chitecture of the implementation, including the integration of
different categories of resources, and computational aspects.
Advanced methods of knowledge mining with information
systems and knowledge resources are becoming increasingly
important. With that, improving knowledge mining and at the
same time integrating larger amounts of data increases the
challenges. The core of challenges is the data analysis. Within
data analysis, comparing “data” is a central task. Comparing
data entities is an even more ambitious task when data objects
and relations are becoming more and more complex.
The term data entity in context with knowledge resources
refers to any data representing objects of any kind like digital
or realia objects, including references, e.g., to objects or
conceptual knowledge. Within this research, special applica-
tion components were created and implemented in order to
provide modular means to be integrated for a comparative
analysis, e.g., knowledge resources referring to structured
and unstructured data, conceptual data, especially knowledge
classiﬁcation, and methods specialised on the before mentioned
means, e.g., the Content Factor method (CONTFACT) [2]. It
is not the task of this practical implementation to re-iterate
the basics of the instruments used. The basics of the method
are explained in theory and practice in the original publication
as well as theory, deﬁnitions, and context are explained and
deﬁned in referred publications.
The multi-disciplinary knowledge resources and the appli-
cation of the Content Factor method have enabled new ﬂexible
workﬂows and the creation of new complementary means
for both the enhancement of multi-disciplinary knowledge
resources and for data-centric knowledge mining and discovery
processes [3]. Some of the most widely required means with
data entities of knowledge resources are components for a
comparative analysis. Comparative Analysis (CA) is deﬁned
as an item-by-item comparison of two or more comparable
entities. The goal of this research is the enhancement of
knowledge resources and mining by appropriate integration of
methods.

Resulting from this research, the enhancements are based
on the new and original integration of Comparative Analysis
and the Content Factor methods, an integration which is im-
plemented and approved with the research projects in various
practical context.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II summarises
the state-of-the-art, motivation, and frame of reference to the
ground of comparison. Section III introduces to knowledge
and integration of different resources, as implemented for this
case study. Section IV presents the integration of conceptual
knowledge and Sections V and VI show the knowledge-centric
integrative architecture for the computation and analysis of
results based on the selected resources and the implementation
of the workﬂow. Section VII discusses the main results and
evaluates them in context of the application. Section VIII
summarises the results and lessons learned, conclusions, and
future work.
II.
STATE-OF-THE-ART, MOTIVATION, AND FRAME
The elementary way of knowledge mining, practised by
the vast majority of approaches and services ignores content
quality, document types, and cognitive knowledge. That means,
content is handled independently from the creation process and
expertise, content from databases, Web pages, and scanned
books are not differentiated, and classiﬁcation of content is
disregarded.
CA modules can be used for arbitrary purposes with knowl-
edge mining workﬂows, e.g., for selecting complementary re-
sources as well as selecting objects supporting decision making
processes. The method is used with knowledge mining work-
ﬂows, integrating dedicated knowledge resources and publicly
available content, e.g., text documents and books, because of
their complementary nature regarding content, structure, and
quality.
The complexity requires to start with a comprehensive high
level view and context for the target of this research. The
following sections describe the motivation and the base of the
conducted CA.
A. Frame of reference
The signiﬁcance of integrating different data entities results
from the context, in which they are placed. This research
presents a method of comparing different data entities as
referred from objects in advanced knowledge resources.
Objects with higher quality are mostly more complex.
Advanced knowledge mining and decision making requires
more than one method or algorithm for analysis of available
objects and their references, data entities, and attributes. A
major challenge is the difference of entities, e.g., regarding
entity type, original purpose of the entity, and source but also
content and structure.
Different types of entities cannot be ignored from advanced
workﬂows because they contain unique knowledge and in-
formation. In most cases, the knowledge and information
can even only be provided by different entities and referred
sources. Methods should be provided, which are beneﬁcial to
be integrated in advanced workﬂows, especially for analysis,
quantisation, and qualiﬁcation of different entities. The de-
ployed means should allow long-term data-centric applications
and intrinsically foster the seamless integration with existing
workﬂows. In addition, the methodologies, methods, and ar-
chitecture of integration should allow the implementation of
modular and least invasive components.
B. Grounds for comparison
Besides the complexity, a combination of data entities
from different sources and different types was choosen for
the following reasons. The rationale behind the choice for
knowledge resources and entities from referred objects results
from complementary content and context. There is an arbitrary
high quality of multi-disciplinary content in the knowledge
resources, which are in continuous development [4]. In addi-
tion, the knowledge resources can provide an extremely high
knowledge and information density. The Gutenberg resources
[5] can provide a large number of fully publicly available
standard text documents and elaborations for a wide multi-
disciplinary context. Both types of resources contain essential
amounts of textual content and are continuously extended
and improved. The relationship between different entities is
the addressed knowledge content with its unique nature. The
thesis is, that different entities should neither be left out
from advanced workﬂows nor should their content, the unique
knowledge and information, be ignored.
C. Organisational scheme
The targeted lens comparison discusses the most impor-
tant aspects text-by-text, focussing on advanced knowledge
resources and referred resources.
For complex lens comparisons of that kind we require to
have an extended focus on integration of resources, including
aspects of automatically created and integrated objects. The
integration further has to resolve and manage conceptual
knowledge, especially for important sources of conceptual
knowledge. Creating concordances is a common means used
with classiﬁcations. Concordances are used for providing refer-
ences between classiﬁcations, they are not used for comparing
or analysing content or data. With the overall goal of enhancing
knowledge resources and mining, supporting and generating
concordances are major means for achieving the integration
of conceptual knowledge. Special care is taken for aspects of
computation and analysis, due to the large complexity and
data and the requirements for compute intensive advanced
methodologies and algorithms.
III.
KNOWLEDGE AND THE INTEGRATION OF RESOURCES
The following sections describe how an integration was
achieved and which results were gained with the analysis.
A. Knowledge
One of the most important sources of understanding knowl-
edge is Aristoteles’ treatise of the Nicomachean Ethics [6],
which is a classic basis of its essence [7], signiﬁcance, and
terms [8].

If one re-visits a place it will, to some extent, be a different
place [9]. There are long-term and short term changes. Every-
thing in the world is connected. This is also true for knowledge
resources, embedded in existing context. Knowledge resources
contain multi-disciplinary knowledge objects, which can be
used in arbitrary ways for providing knowledge, e.g., factual,
conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge [10].
The objects [11] can contain any content and context as well
as references, e.g., translations, transliterations, synonyms,
associations [12], references [13], conceptual knowledge (e.g.,
UDC), concordances [14], links, references (see, “s.”), optional
references (see also, “s. also”), comparable references (com-
pare, “comp.”), keywords, and Content Factors (of elements)
[15]. The objects can be based on records, e.g., characters,
words, lines, and complex records. In practical application
scenarios [16], any content and context can be used for analysis
and evaluation of an object.
B. Data entities
Data entities can be created from many resources. With this
research, knowledge objects and data entities were automat-
ically created from ‘Gutenberg documents’. At the time of
the case study (January 2017) Project Gutenberg [5] offered
53,855 free ebooks for download. At the time of preparation of
this article (February 2018) Project Gutenberg offered 56,432
free ebooks for download. The document ﬁles include the
text in a version of the respective edition, which can be a
revised edition or translation. The text editions are linked
as different document ﬁles, e.g., plain text ﬁles, which can
be converted into data entities and integrated with different
data entities. Regarding conceptual knowledge, the Guten-
berg documents use a ﬂat implementation of the Library of
Congress (LoC) classiﬁcation outline [17]. The ebook links
contain some relevant information, too, e.g., the bibliographic
record, EBook-No. 25062, a link the LoC Class entries, and
the release date of the edition. The original publication date of
the source text is contained in the document ﬁles. Publications
like books and articles are not “unstructured”. They differ in
structure from knowledge resources’ content but they can be
seen as structured entities, too. Data entities from knowledge
resources’ collections and containers [2] are used with many
knowledge mining applications [4].
With the created modules the data entities from the Guten-
berg resources can be handled in the same way as knowledge
resources’ objects, e.g., of different origin. The following case
study starts with a knowledge mining request for “Vesuvius”
in the context of “volcanology”. The primary Gutenberg result
matrix contains a number of documents [18]-[24] provided
with the precomputation. The essential steps and data of the
examples should be comprehensible as these choosen resources
are publicly available.
C. Object and data entity integration: Four cases
The following passages introduce four different types of ob-
jects, which were considered in order to integrate the available
knowledge. The four types of objects are originating from three
major groups of resources, namely publicly provided book and
document object, collection objects, and container objects. For
the ﬁrst group, it is shown that the respective objects can have
signiﬁcant different characteristics, which is shown comparing
two samples.
Objects and data entities can be integrated with knowledge
resources in arbitrary ways, e.g., as a referred object or by
creating an instance of an object. Here, for the goal of this
research, the programming and programming languages of the
modules are not relevant for the demonstration. Signiﬁcant
is the integration, which allows an analysis and evaluation,
e.g., with knowledge resources’ objects. The following excerpt
(Figure 1) shows a knowledge resources’ object automatically
created from an entity of Gutenberg document 33483 [19] with
LoC classiﬁcation [25].

Figure 4. Knowledge resources container object, processed instance of a
simple container entry “Vesuvius” (LX resources, excerpt).
The container objects comprise of various knowledge, espe-
cially factual and conceptual references, including concor-
dances. Objects can also contain multi-lingual entries. The
organisation of the objects in a speciﬁc container is similiar to
identical. The resources’ access and processing can be done in
any programming language, assuming that the interfaces are
implemented. For example, combining scripting, ﬁltering, and
parallel programming can provide ﬂexible approaches.
The data used here is based on the content and context from
the knowledge resources, provided by the LX Foundation Sci-
entiﬁc Resources (LX not an acronym) [4]. The integration and
implementation of conceptual knowledge and concordances as
shown part of the objects will be discussed in the next section.
IV.
INTEGRATION OF CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE
Conceptual knowledge (e.g., classiﬁcation) is a very impor-
tant means for describing objects. For the Gutenberg resources
a simple LoC classiﬁcation for every document is provided,
which allows to get the major topic classiﬁcation.
The knowledge resources can use any classiﬁcation for
describing objects, elements, and views. This also allows to use
multiple classiﬁcations and even specialised classiﬁcations for
the description. The resources can also provide concordances
for mapping the classiﬁcations.
All these means can be used for the documentation and anal-
ysis of objects, e.g., comparisons. The conceptual knowledge
provides the facilities to handle objects and entities even from
different sources and context.
A. Implemented references to conceptual knowledge
The objects resulting from the mining request for “Vesuvius”
in the context of “volcanology” are also referred with concep-
tual knowledge. Table I shows some examples of Gutenberg
objects and their classiﬁcation referenced with the knowledge
resources.

Classiﬁcations of UDC editions consistently refer to verbal
descriptions. For this part of the research all small unsorted
excerpts of the knowledge resources objects only refer to main
UDC-based classes, which for this part of the publication are
taken from the Multilingual Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation
Summary (UDCC Publication No. 088) [36] released by the
UDC Consortium under the Creative Commons Attribution
Share Alike 3.0 license [37] (ﬁrst release 2009, subsequent

The table lists those entries resulting from the concordances
and from associated objects. The UDC is available in about 50
languages. The English verbal descriptions were used for this
case study. The verbal description can be included in the con-
text creation and can, for example, provide scalable fuzziness
for creating multi-disciplinary context. The LX knowledge
resources’ structure and the classiﬁcation references [38] based
on UDC [39], [40], [36] are essential means for the process-
ing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge objects and
containers. Both provide strong multi-disciplinary and multi-
lingual support.
B. Concordances
Different resources as well as different disciplines may use
different classiﬁcations. Gutenberg is currently using the LoC.
The knowledge resources are using a Universal Classiﬁed
Classiﬁcation (UCC) both with classiﬁcation and concordances
for the objects collected over time. The listing in Figure 5
shows a simple example for concordances.

The references to individual, specialised and universal clas-
siﬁcations consistently describe the conceptual knowledge as
correct as possible within a classiﬁcation.
The concordances integrate the context of more than one
classiﬁcation. This enhances facilities for in-depth description
and integration, the specialisation on conceptual knowledge
as well as the broadness of universal knowledge and context.

Figure 6. Classiﬁcation and concordances excerpt of a simple object
instance (knowledge resources collection).
The excerpt shows classiﬁcation concordances in several dif-
ferent classiﬁcations as used in different disciplines. Even a lot
of internal details of such concordances are self-explanatory
with a basic knowledge and practice of the used classiﬁca-
tions. Concordances also interlink different classiﬁcations and
disciplines. To a certain extent most classiﬁcations also express
the context of certain disciplines. Possibly multiple views from
different disciplines or author groups on a certain object are
not shown in this reduced view but they can also hold the full
spectrum of classiﬁcations and concordances and also express
views and development of views and object instances over
time.
V.
KNOWLEDGE-CENTRIC INTEGRATIVE ARCHITECTURE
The analysis of integrated resources requires advanced meth-
ods and algorithms. A method used for description and analysis
of objects is the Content Factor.
A. Content Factor computation for data entities
Objects of any kind can be integrated with knowledge
resources. Objects can contain instances of data entities and
refer to associated knowledge. For an analysis, a number of
common information regarding the objects and data entities is
required.
Examples were shown in the previous section on object and
data entity integration, where objects were transformed into
collection objects, including references to further knowledge
like factual knowledge and classiﬁcation.
The following excerpt (Figure 7) illustrates the creation of
Content Factor deﬁnition sets [2] for the use with data entities.
All the basics details and the algorithm of the method are
described in the original publication. Deﬁnition sets are used
for both Gutenberg resources and knowledge resources.

Figure 10. NBCF κB computed for knowledge resources object
“Vesuvius” (LX Resources, excerpt).
All NBCF were computed with the same deﬁnition set (Fig-
ure 7). The data entities from the referenced Gutenberg
resources and knowledge resources both contain multiple
matches. The resulting Content Factor for the knowledge
resources object is higher due to the higher concentration of
relevant elements in the object. The Gutenberg object shows
a higher absolute number of matches and multiple hits.
B. Architecture and integration
The Content Factor provides a measure, which can be used
for describing characteristics of different objects.
The method can be used in general for any kind of object and
is not restricted to limited kinds of documents. The Gutenberg
document resources were choosen for the case study because
of their range of content, type of documents, and availability
of different text formats, which correspond with the intended
integration with other resources.
The following diagram (Figure 11) depicts the architecture
design of the conceptual solution as used for the implemen-
tation. The illustration shows the categories of resources and
their integration regarding their contributions to a Comparative
Analysis workﬂow, implemented for the use with the Guten-
berg resources.
The workﬂow shows the abstract mathematical and compu-
tations details of the integration of resources, especially the
interfaces, analysis, join, visualisation, statistics, and plotting
as of the developed solution. With this research, resources can
be divided in three major categories, symbolised as columns,
depending on their nature and characteristics.
The central resources are knowledge resources, containing
collections and containers as well as referenced and integrated
resources. Content is arbitrary, e.g., any factual knowledge,
conceptual knowledge, and procedural knowledge.
In this case, the enhancement of the means of mining and the
knowledge resources are subject originary resources, especially
the resources of the Gutenberg Project [5].

Figure 11. Architecture and integration: Categories of resources and their integration, showing the contributions to a Comparative Analysis workﬂow, implemented
for the use with the Gutenberg resources being dynamically integrated, e.g., for analysis, visualisation, and statistics in an automated decision making workﬂow.
For the mining example, the integration and precomputation
has to care for volcanic features container, geo collection, and
the integrated objects from the Gutenberg resources.
C. Knowledge Resources and originary resources
The analysis of different classiﬁcations, development of
concepts for intermediate classiﬁcations, and experiences from
case studies from the research conducted in the Knowledge
in Motion (KiM) long-term project [41] have contributed
to the application of UDC and different classiﬁcations and
concordance schemes in the context of knowledge resources.
The following term deﬁnitions for object, container, and
matrix can be helpful in this context.
•
An object is an entity of knowledge data being part
of knowledge resources. An object can contain any
documentation, references, and other data. Objects can
have an arbitrary number of sub-objects.
•
A container is a collection of knowledge objects in a
conjoint format.
•
A matrix is a subset of the entirety, the “universe”,
of knowledge. A workﬂow can consist of many sub-
workﬂows each of which can be based on an arbitrary
number of knowledge matrices. The output of any sub-
workﬂow or workﬂow can be seen as an intermediate or
ﬁnal result matrix.
The ﬂexible creation of objects carrying references, especially
classiﬁcation and concordances is the fundament for advanced.
knowledge processing and computing.
Collections can hold objects, which are more or less in-
dividual consist of any smaller entities and can have any
references to other objects or resources. Containers can hold
object, which have a comparable structure and comparable
entities, e.g., objects belonging to a certain ﬁeld of research
or discipline. External resources can be referred from these
objects and resources but it is also possible to integrate objects,

collections, and containers from external resources.
The category of originary resources can contain realia ob-
jects, original digital objects, as well as sources and publication
resources, e.g., physical or digital books or proceedings. Most
of the resources in this category restrict access to their content
and provide limited interfaces and individual structures.
D. Computation and integration
The category of application resources and components can
hold applicable implementations, e.g., software routines, inter-
faces, and services.
The Gutenberg resources were choosen for this implemen-
tation and the practical case study. The Gutenberg resources
provide published materials for free Open Access, especially
books, but neither provide interfaces nor further usable struc-
tures like containers in the aforementioned meaning.
The implementation therefore considered an integration of
Gutenberg resource entities into the knowledge resources, on
the level of collections and containers. The integration can
be done dynamically and non-dynamically as well as the
integration can be persistent with the knowledge resources or
not. In any case, the reason is to created objects and entities,
which are at a comparable level with other available objects,
in content type and structure. The objects and entities are
precomputed for that purpose. Therefore, with the application
resources, the implementation can provide modules for the
integration and precomputation. In consequence, the workﬂow
(Figure 11) can rely on the integrated resources and the
modules provided by the application resources.
The workﬂow requires interface modules for the partici-
pating resources, one individual module per resource type.
This step includes additional preparation, e.g., inconsistencies
checkers and data slicers. Data slicers are partitioning the
available content in a way in which is seems reasonable to
have a common analysis with the integrated objects, e.g., based
on full objects, entities, text blocks or lines.
The next steps do the analysis of objects, also considering
their individual nature and original, in order to prepare for
joining the data. A consequent step does an intermediate visu-
alisation, generating a plotting routine for further consequent
statistics, analysis and visualisation. The plotting generator is
especially signiﬁcant in this case study because the partial
intermediate visualisation can deliver important information
for further statistics and visualisation.
VI.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WORKFLOW
A. Procedures and modules
Two main modules were required with the assistance pre-
computation for identifying and selecting objects and data
entities from the Gutenberg resources before entering the CA
workﬂow. The preparative assistance data was computed with
a module gutenberganalysis and the classiﬁcation was
extracted with a module gutenbergloc.
The ﬁrst module extracts the desired content of an speciﬁc
object and checks for association with the mining request,
e.g., keywords and referenced knowledge. The second module
extracts the classiﬁcation of a speciﬁc object.
The CA workﬂow builds on these preparatory results. The
implementation case study for the comparative analysis method
required the creation of several major components and mod-
ules. Table IV shows a sequence of modules, which allows to
create the base for a CA workﬂow as created with this case
study.

The workﬂow shows the principle procedures. Practically,
the modules can be implemented with any environment and
frameworks. In the case study Perl [42], Shell, and Gnuplot
[43] were used. In general this means any module could be
replaced by a different implementation separately.
Any module requires conﬁguration options, which at least
can be pre-conﬁgured options. In their application, the anal-
ysis up to visualisation modules for the Gutenberg resources
are identical to the application for the knowledge resources.
Therefore, the computations for all data entities were done with
the textca group of modules. The module special for the
Gutenberg resources is the Gutenberg interface, which requires
to implement the proper handling as desired for structure and
content of the integrated knowledge.
The next sections will show how a CA analysis is done in
detail and discusses some examples of possible characteristics,
which can be read from the results of the analysis. The
analysis is done for objects and resources, which were already
introduced. The examples include knowledge collections and
containers. Example outputs of modules are given as is,
meaning the ﬁgures show direct visualisation output from the
implementation.
B. Comparison of data entities in and with collections
The following part illustrates characteristics of an integrated
object and a knowledge resources collection object. Figure 12
shows the automatically computed CA module result for a
case insensitive vesuv ([Vv][Ee][Ss][Uu][Vv]) target for
the above Gutenberg object instance (Figure 1) of the originary
object [19].

Figure 12. Comparative Analysis module result for a Gutenberg object
precomputed by an assistance process for the case insensitive vesuv target.
The analysis including the illustration was automatically
computed for the respective object. The results are shown
on the background of a representation of the object entity.
Resulting element counts displayed against line numbers reveal
some respective characteristics of the object entity. The object
entity extends over the maximum count / line number range
(greenish color). Some assistive values are given, like number
of records (lines in this case), number of hits, maximum,
minimum, and mean value of hits. Despite the large number
of hits, here, the mean value (blueish color) of hits is quite
low, due to the relatively large number of records. The result
also reveals sequences of higher hit-density and hit-patterns in
the object entity in the illustration.
Figure 13 shows the automatically computed CA module
result with the respective target (pattern) for the resulting
knowledge resources collection object “Vesuvius” (Figure 3).

Figure 13. Comparative Analysis module result for the knowledge resources
collection object “Vesuvius” (LX resources, geoscientiﬁc collection, excerpt).
The result shows some criteria of the object itself in context
with the relevant mining pattern. The ﬁgure illustrates that the
object contains a relevant mining result in the ﬁrst and several
consecutive records (here: lines) with a maximal occurance
count of one in a record.
The density of relevant occurances in the object is relatively
high compared to common texts, even if from comparable
special topic documents. Therefore, the mean value is quite
high in that case. The computed background shading illustrates
the space spanned by the available records (number of lines)
and element counts. The mean value is illustrated by the border
of the color change.
Both ﬁgures show that all terms were considered case insen-
sitive. Here, collection objects and integrated object documents
are choosen, which are referring to Vesuvius. For both, the
mining workﬂow considers different ways of writing. Thus,
for example, associations of Vesuvius and Pozzulan as well as
directly linking to volcanic features and meteoric features via
different resources.
The differences are intrinsic characteristics of the two types
of objects, e.g., the length of the object, the concentration
of hits, especially at the top of the object, and relatively
high mean value of hits. The characteristics can be used to
automatically decide to which extend objects can contribute to
enhancements. Longer objects can contain several passages of
records, which can be compared separately with an object and
contribute to the enhancement of resources.
Features and properties of objects in collections are different
to objects in containers. In many cases the differences of gen-
eral objects in the Gutenberg resources can best be described
in collections. Nevertheless, the comparison of collection and
container objects will reveal characteristics of objects in both,
which can contribute to the enhancement of workﬂow results.

Figure 16. Comparative Analysis module result for the volcanological features
container for case insensitive vulc/volc target (LX resources).
Both ﬁgures (Figures 16 and 14) illustrate the very high
relevance of the objects. Nevertheless, the structure and density
of hits is much higher in the container object than in the
Gutenberg object. In addition, the mean value is extremely high
for the container object. Also, the central part of the container
object does not contain a line without the target. There are
even more hits than records.
Even in a top hit Gutenberg object the number of records is
much higher and the number of hits is lower. The comparison
also reveals that both objects represent different object types,
a knowledge resources object and a classical text object. The
latter one mostly contains natural language. For any resources,
many CA and Content Factor computations are done on a result
matrix. With any workﬂow further information and decision
making support can result from computing assistant views for
the knowledge entities, e.g., based on their context.
D. Assistant views
For any type of resources, many CA and Content Factor
computations are done on a result matrix. Besides the knowl-
edge mining request “Vesuvius” in the context of “volcanol-
ogy” with this example, the comparison with other requests
can be helpful.
For example, common words, e.g.,‘the’, which does rarely
occur in containers but mostly in book texts can be used for
automated decision making. Figure 17 shows the computed
CA module result for a Gutenberg object for a very common
target, the.

In result, the relative density is an excellent indicator for
a longer natural language object. The accumulation of hits,
e.g., a wrapping curve, indicates a longer homogeneously
structured natural language object. The distribution indicates
that the respective natural language document rarely contains
longer passages of content, which will represent container-
like knowledge. The results of the CA, the Content Factor,
classiﬁcation, and any results and attributes from assistant
views can be included in an workﬂow and analysis, e.g., if a
ranking of results is required for a speciﬁc knowledge mining
workﬂow.
VII.
DISCUSSION
The case study integrates sources of different knowledge
entities for knowledge mining workﬂows, selecting entities
by computing advanced analysis criteria. The combination of
advanced methods and the integration of resources are the
essential basis for enhancement processes.
A. Integration and comparison
The selected data compasses over 50,000 Gutenberg doc-
uments and more than 50,000 objects from knowledge re-
sources. The selected sizes of objects range from hundreds
of bytes to several megabytes.
The limitation for the case study was done for demon-
stration, due to the fact that the number of available overall

57

knowledge resources objects may easily outnumber the number
of Gutenberg documents. With the resources, the classiﬁcation
considers about ﬁfty languages, summing up to about three
million descriptions. Conceptual assistance is available for
resource and object classiﬁcation, which allows to automate
integration workﬂows.
For the integration, instances of the objects containing the
relevant data entities were automatically computed. It was
possible to apply the provided means in the same way to the
entities. The computation for the data entities from knowledge
resources can be much more ﬁne grained and systematic due
to the complex structures and elements. The computation for
the Gutenberg data entities can use the same means but some
details and structure are not automatically available. The data
sizes of the main Gutenberg data entities are most probably
larger than these of the average knowledge resources’ data
entities.
The Content Factor method delivers an efﬁcient tool in order
to select object entities for their later integration with the
knowledge resources and discovery workﬂows. The resulting
objects can be easily CA computed and analysed regarding
their contributions to enhancing the resources as well as the
results of discovery.
Terms like ‘precision’ to not apply when dealing with
complex knowledge, especially when knowledge entities are
containing or are described by natural language content. In
these terms, ‘precision’ depends on the question asked by
the person implementing a scenario. Here, e.g., the CA mean
values ﬁll in for the purpose of a suitable measure. The range
is from maximum ﬁt to minimum ﬁt.
B. CA mean values
Table V compares CA mean values from the computation for
selected objects and target groups for the integrated resources.

There are entities with higher and lower mean values, for the
Gutenberg resources as well as for the knowledge resources.
Higher values indicate a cumulation of relevant terms, e.g., as
with the appearance in collections, tabulars, and listings.
Practice showed that for complementing knowledge in the
volcanological features container with extended context, rele-
vant entities from the Gutenberg resources with higher mean
values can be a primary source for references. Relevant entities
from the Gutenberg resources with lower mean values may
primarily deliver reference information for collection objects.
C. Comparisons in computation and analysis
As illustrated, longer objects can contain several passages
of records, which can be compared separately with an object
and contribute to the enhancement of resources. Beyond that,
decisive workﬂows can beneﬁt from the comparative results as
to choose the best-ﬁt objects for decisions, especially selecting
the most ﬁtting/associated passages in a text and comparing it
to the most ﬁtting/associated passage in another text.
Decisive workﬂows of that dimension are very challenging
regarding computation and analysis. Table VI lists the counts
of comparisons for the application in the above case study.
The values are given for a single mining request (Figure 7).

A number of comparisons have to be done per mining
request, depending on the complexity of the request and the
conﬁguration of the resources. In the above case, collections,
containers, and integrated resources were used. Counts of
comparisons were done in the respective entities and content,
not in references outside the subsets.
In consequence, comparisons were done over all of the con-
ﬁgured resources. The comparisons also included the ﬁlenames
of the known integrated objects and the labels of the collection
and containers entities because these regulary contain relevant
knowledge for mining requests.
Most mining requests beneﬁt from checking the result and
trying to get additional information and enhanced results from
the ﬁrst results, using the same resources. In that case the ﬁrst,
second, and further result levels are considered intermediate
results, which are used to go in depth and width for the
consecutive mining.
The counts illustrate that a mining request can be very
challenging, even for a subset of conﬁgured resources. There
can also be needs to pre-cache and pre-compute resources,
depending on the purpose of the application scenario in which
the mining request should be embedded. In this case, the levels
of the intermediate result generation can be considered an
enhancement of selection, which leads to less comparisons
required with the levels.
D. Ranking
For this scenario, a ranking was built from the rankings
for the entities from the Gutenberg entities and from the
knowledge resources.

The ranking considers the available information, e.g., clas-
siﬁed targets, relevance of targets, references and context. The
Gutenberg ranking especially considers the results from the
CA, Content Factor and classiﬁcation (LoC), based on the
primary Gutenberg result matrix. The ranking of knowledge re-
sources especially considers the CA, Content Factor, and clas-
siﬁcation, e.g., UDC and Universal Classiﬁed Classiﬁcation
(UCC). The integrated ranking considers the the CA, Content
Factor values, and concordances of comparable entities.
An integration for a workﬂow ranking requires that the
means need to be individually choosen for a certain application
scenario. In this case, a records base (lines) was an appropriate
choice for CA, Content Factor, and conceptual knowledge.
E. Computational trace and context
A common knowledge discovery process integrates a se-
quence of decision making processes at different levels, e.g.,
from which resources to which single objects. Each step in a
sequence can require to handle millions of objects and refer-
ences. The access to the Gutenberg resources is not intended to
be automated. Therefore, no performance data is available for
the Gutenberg resources or for conducting the precomputation
for its whole content. The precomputation assistance includes
the cached Gutenberg content for the respective mining targets.
Table VII shows the computation characteristics relevant
with the workﬂow procedure for an example of the above
integrated Gutenberg and knowledge resources case for two
objects.

The table times refer to one Central Processing Unit (CPU)
per mining process (Intel Xeon, at 2.9 GHz). Due to the
complexity of the elementary workﬂows it is not desirable to
have more than one CPU per process involved at the atomic
level. Arbitrary practical application scenarios involving many
processes with large data resources may be organised to ﬁt the
architecture of the available infrastructure. With certain scenar-
ios, where an author wants to integrate complex references, the
precomputation assistance can beneﬁt a lot from using many-
CPU infrastructures.
The higher level workﬂow step, integrating the aforemen-
tioned procedures, will use a lot of intermediate results from
procedures and content from resources. There is no general
range for the time scale at the higher levels but at these
levels the requirements on computation and communication
can be extremely high, therefore, the higher level steps are
candidates for parallelisation. Anyhow, workﬂow creators must
always be aware that computing requirements can be non-
linear, depending on the workﬂow created by an author for
a choosen purpose.
VIII.
CONCLUSION
The paper presented the results of a research based on an ad-
vanced method for knowledge mining with multi-disciplinary
knowledge resources and different data entities. Required
modules and algorithms were successfully and efﬁciently im-
plemented for supporting a Comparative Analysis, integrating
different data entities in mining workﬂows.
This research showed that important characteristics of ob-
jects can be automatically identiﬁed and the results can be
used for enhancing knowledge resources themselves as well
as the discovery processes. The basis of the success is that
with the availability of appropriate methodologies and methods
different entities neither need to be left out from advanced
knowledge mining workﬂows nor should their content be
ignored. It was shown that in result, there is a complementary
relationship between objects from knowledge resources and
referred objects from external sources, including their data
entities.
The Content Factor method for data description and analysis
is used with all available resources. As was shown, CA
methods cannot be replaced by other means like classiﬁcation
or Content Factor because they are based on completely
different grounds but these complementary means can be
integrated within more complex workﬂows. Classiﬁcation is
an integral complement in all parts of CA methods. In an
implementation it means, e.g., that UDC can be used in all
steps and components, starting from the knowledge resources.
CA modules can help optimise the decision making, e.g., with
supporting context-spanning Content Factor deﬁnition sets. CA
modules can be used for delivering additional descriptive infor-
mation, which can be used for documentation and knowledge
mining purposes. CA is much beyond statistics. The signiﬁcant
part of the CA is the visualisation of pattern sequences in
entities. The pattern sequences hold relevant parts of the entity
characteristics and can also be used for documentation. The
statistics are used in addition, for the analysis.
In consequence, the method allows an effective integration
of resources and a dynamical selection of objects and entities.
Selected objects and entities can be used dynamically, e.g.,
in discovery and decision making but also for persistently
enhancing the context and references of available knowledge
resources.
Objects from advanced knowledge resources can provide an
excellent data base on knowledge. The knowledge resources
can provide high quality object collections and containers
with data entities of most reliable and unique content and
qualities. Referred objects from external sources can extend
the available data base regarding width and depth. Therefore,
referred objects and external sources can extend the available
data base and content. In the case study, the best ﬁt targets
regarding volcanological features from the resources, including
the Gutenberg resources, were automatically analysed.
The method can enhance the quantity and quality of knowl-
edge resources and dicovery results by integration and analysis

of content and context for many application scenarios. In
the case studies the quality was veriﬁed manually. A single
measure of quality is out of scope of this research because thr
evaluation would depend on a certain purpose of application.
On the side of the Gutenberg resources, a number of
challenges have been found especially with the Gutenberg
objects themselves. With the documents, workﬂow creators
face a lot of inconsistencies in structure and marking even
regarding major elements. Bibliographic data and versioning
could also be improved. Better structured and more complete
bibliographic data would be beneﬁcial for any wider and
systematic use. A common container format for the Gutenberg
documents, handling any data ﬁles and associated data in a
ﬂexible and ‘clean’ way would be beneﬁcial.
The integration of the Content Factor method and the
Comparative Analysis method is used in practice for progres-
sive advancement of long-term multi-disciplinary knowledge
resources and mining in a number of institutions and projects,
including the knowledge resources used here for demonstration
purposes. Special targets in practice are quality and quantity of
entities but also balancing the content and context development
of knowledge resources.
Information sciences, especially knowledge mining meth-
ods, have countless areas of implementation. Anyhow, the
application scenarios of the methodology and the implemented
methods are even not limited to knowledge mining. Besides the
purpose laid out with this research, CA modules can be used as
complementary and supportive methods applied with a wide
range of advanced applications like document identiﬁcation
or plagiarism detection. For complex solutions, it can be
desirable to integrate many components and modules. From
the view of (the modern understanding of) technics, licensing
acts as starting point for realisation of technical solutions. In
this respect, licensing solutions are an integral part of almost
any technical realisation and vice versa. Future work will be
spent on further integrating different resources and creating
methodologies, methods, and means for handling data entities
and objects as well as on realisation aspects and education for
the context of superordinate knowledge.
