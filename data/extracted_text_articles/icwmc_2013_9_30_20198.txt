Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the effects of imperfect
channel estimation on the performance of a Selective-Decode-
and-Forward (SDF) relay-assisted communication system. In
the system studied, a pilot symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM)
scheme is used along with a channel estimation scheme based on
minimum mean square error (MMSE). In particular, we derive
an approximate expression for the bit error probability (BEP) in
the presence of channel estimation error for the SDF cooperative
protocol. Numerical simulations are presented to show that the
derived approximate BEP expression is very close to the actual
BEP. We also provide power-allocation that optimally assigns
power constraint to training and data transmission phases to
minimize the BEP.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in information and wireless technologies
have led to growing interests in the development of multiple-
input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which improves
spectral and power efﬁciency of wireless networks. However,
installing multiple antennas at transmitter and/or receiver re-
sults in size expansion of the devices, which is not practical
in many wireless applications. A cooperative communication
system can be considered as an alternative to MIMO systems.
Cooperative techniques can exploit cooperative diversity by
means of providing several copies of a signal that have
experienced channel gains with low correlations [1][2][3].
Furthermore, early research in cooperative communication has
shown that energy efﬁcient transmitters operating in relay
networks help extend the battery life [4].
According to the way in which the information is trans-
mitted from the source terminal to the relay terminals and
the way it is processed at the relay terminals, the existing
cooperative protocols can usually be divided into three types –
such as decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, selective decode-
and-forward (SDF) protocols and amplify-and-forward (AF)
protocols [1][2][3][5].
In the DF protocol, the relay terminals decode the received
signal, then the sequence will be re-encoded and it will be
forwarded to the destination terminal. In the SDF protocol,
the relay terminals detect the signal and check if the detected
signal contains any error. If the information sequence is
considered error free, then the sequence will be re-encoded
by either the same or a different code before it will be
ﬁnally transmitted to the destination terminal. In AF protocols,
the relay terminals simply re-transmit a scaled version of
the signal that they receive from the source terminal to the
destination terminal.
Most of the existing work on cooperative communications
has assumed perfect knowledge of the channel fading coef-
ﬁcients at the receiver side, which is an overly optimistic
assumption, and does not match with reality. For instance,
W. Su et al. [6] and A. S. Ibrahim et al. [7] assume that
the receiver has access to perfect information about the
channel and the transmitter knows the instantaneous channel
gain without the phase component. Various expressions for
the symbol error probability of a cooperative communica-
tion system have been derived in [8][9][10][11] under the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) at both
the relay and destination. Although research results based
on these assumptions provide valuable insights, in practical
systems these coefﬁcients must be estimated and then used
in the detection process. Especially, in mobile applications,
the assumption of perfect channel knowledge is unwarranted
as randomly varying channel conditions are learned by the
receivers imperfectly.
In recent work (e.g., [12][13]), the effects of the channel
estimation error on the bit error rate (BER) performance
of cooperative communication systems have been studied by
using a simple model for the channel estimation error, where
the variance of the channel estimation error is assumed to be
ﬁxed for all values of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Y. Wu et
al. [14] investigate effects of channel estimation errors on the
symbol-error-rate (SER) performance of a cooperative com-
munication system operating in AF mode. J. Zhang et al. [15]
assume that the receiver estimates the channel imperfectly,
based on the pilot signal sent by the transmitter. Moreover,
both the source and the relay perform an optimization on the
power to be allocated to the pilot and data, assuming that
achievable rate is the only factor to be optimized.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous work exists

on the BEP performance of selective decode-and-forward
relay communication system that uses pilot symbol-assisted
modulation for channel estimation.
In the present paper, we derive a lower bound for BEP
performance of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation
for the selective decode-and-forward relay communication
system. We then apply the lower bound expression of BEP
as the performance metric of the system, and solve a power
allocation problem to optimally allocate power to training and
data sequences.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst
introduce our system model and channel estimation in Section
II. In Section III, the BEP expression is derived for the
system under consideration. Simulation results are presented in
Section IV, followed by conclusion and future work in Section
V.
Notation: E{·}, {·}∗, ˆx denote the expected value, the com-
plex conjugate and the estimate of the variable x, respectively.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND CHANNEL ESTIMATION
We consider a three-node relay network, which consists of a
source, relay, and destination node. This relay network model
is depicted in Figure 1. We assume BPSK transmission over
ﬂat fading channels. Note that this assumption is imposed
only for the convenience of notation. The analysis in this
paper can also be applied, after some simple modiﬁcations, to
the case wherein the source and the relay transmit using M-
ary phase shift keying (MPSK) modulation. Let hsd, hsr and
hrd represent the source-destination, source-relay, and relay-
destination channel gains, respectively. Each node-to-node
channel gain is modelled by a zero-mean complex Gaussian
random variable with variance σ2
h. Furthermore, each channel
is assumed to be constant during the frame transmission where
each frame consists of a ﬁxed number of symbols. A practical
relay node with low cost usually cannot transmit and receive
signal at the same time in the same frequency band. We assume
that nodes transmit under half-duplex constraint in the same
frequency band.
As in [1], the transmission protocol can be described as
follows: First, the source transmits data to both relay and
destination with power Ps. The received signals at the relay
and the destination can be written as:
ysr =
p
Pshsrx + nsr
(1)
ysd =
p
Pshsdx + nsd
(2)
where nsr and nsd represent the additive noise terms, x
represents the transmitted symbol with unit average energy,
i.e., E{|x|2} = 1 and Ps is the source power (energy per
symbol time) for data transmission. In the second time slot,
if the relay correctly detects the received message in the ﬁrst
time slot, then it will forward it to the destination; otherwise,
the relay will remain silent to avoid the propagation of errors
[7]. Thus, the received signal at the destination in the second
time slot is in the following form
yrd = θ
p
Prhrdx + nrd
(3)
where θ can be either 0 or 1 indicating whether the relay
was silent or not, nrd is additive noise term, and Pr is the
relay power (energy per symbol time) for data transmission.
At the end of the second time slot, the destination will combine
the desired signals from the source and the relay, if any, and
attempt to detect the symbol.

Transmission structure in a block of M symbols
The transmission block consists of two phases−training
phase and data transmission phase. We assume that the
communication between nodes is through single-input-single-
output (SISO) channel. For channel gain estimation of a
SISO system, only one pilot symbol is required [15][16].
To reduce the variance of channel estimation errors, one can
either increase the number of pilot symbols or use a higher
pilot transmit power. As in [15], we assume that only one
pilot symbol is used to estimate the channel coefﬁcient. We
point out that since block fading channels are considered, the
accuracy of MMSE channel estimation depends only on the
total training signal power regardless of the training duration,
and increasing the number of training symbols in each block
results in decreasing the throughput. We assume that, in the
considered scheme, the source and relay can allocate power
to pilot phase and data phase in different proportions. At the
beginning of the frame, the source sends a pilot symbol, which
we denote as sp, to the relay and destination. The received
signals, rp
sr and rp
sd can be expressed as follows
rp
sr = hsrsp + nsr

rp
sd = hsdsp + nsd
(4)
where rp
sr and rp
sd are the received pilot signals at the relay
and at the destination, respectively. Then, the relay sends pilot
symbol s′
p to the destination. The received pilot signal at the
destination is as follows
rp
rd = hrds′
p + nrd
(5)
The noise terms nsd, nsr, and nrd are modelled as zero mean
complex Gaussian random variables with equal variance N0
(N0/2 per real dimension).
The system conveys source information as a sequence of
frames, and each frame in the ﬁrst time slot accommodates M
symbols sent from the source–one symbol is dedicated for pilot
and the rest are for data transmission (Figure 2). The second
time slot of the frame accommodates M symbols sent from the
relay–one symbol is dedicated for pilot and the rest are for data
transmission (Figure 2). The energy allocated to a frame for
the source’s transmission is denoted by P1, and the energy
allocated to a frame for the relay’s transmission is denoted by
P2 (that is, if the relay ends up transmitting in that frame).
Parameter α denotes the fraction of source’s energy allocated
for transmission during the training phase, and β denotes the
fraction of relay’s energy allocated for transmission during
the training phase. Thus, |sp|2 and |s′
p|2, the transmit energies
for the training phase are equal to αP1 (if transmitted by the
source) and βP2 (if transmitted by the relay), respectively,
where 0 < α, β < 1. Source power (energy per symbol
time) for data transmission (Ps) and the relay power for data
transmission (Pr) can be obtained as:
Ps = (1 − α)P1
M − 1
,
Pr = (1 − β)P2
M − 1
(6)
The relayed communication system considered in the
present paper assumes that the relay and the destination both
estimate the wireless channel gain from the received pilot
signal using MMSE channel estimation method.
MMSE estimate of the channel is obtained at the relay and
destination by using ˆhsr = E{hsrrp

Remark: In the derivation of (23), it is assumed that the
relay is perfectly capable of diagnosing whether there has been
an error in the detection of the symbol transmitted by the
source. Based on this diagnosis, if the detection was erroneous
the relay would not forward that symbol to the destination
in the second time slot. In a practical system, error detection
scheme (e.g., cyclic redundancy check) could be implemented.
In the following, we prove (23) is a lower bound of the BEP
for a more practical system in which the relay uses a block
error detection scheme:
I) The case in which the relay mistakenly concludes that
there is a symbol that is detected wrong in the frame (while
all the symbols were detected correctly at the relay): In this
case, at the second time slot, the relay remains silent and the
whole frame is kept from being forwarded. In the practical
system, the ﬁnal symbol detection at the destination is made
only based on the received signal at the ﬁrst time slot, which
results in a higher BEP than the ideal system of Section II.
II) The case in which the relay’s block error detection
mistakenly concludes that all the detected symbols in the frame
are error-free (while there is a symbol that is detected with
error at the relay): In the practical system, the relay forwards
the frame which includes some symbol different from the
source’s and the frame may contain some corrected decoded
symbols. In the ideal system of Section II, which leads to (23),
only correctly decoded symbols will be forwarded. For the

correctly decoded symbols, the destination’s symbol detection,
which combines the signal from the source and the signal from
the relay, will result in the same probability of error in both
the practical system and the ideal system. For a symbol that
is detected by the relay with error, in the practical system the
destination will end up combining the signal from the source
and a signal carrying a different symbol from the relay, while
in the ideal system of section II the destination will detect it
based only on the signal form the source. Therefore, the ideal
system will have less likelihood of making a symbol (bit) error.
III) In the case in which the relay correctly concludes that
the frame contains a symbol that is decoded with error at
the relay: In this case, in the system the whole frame is kept
from being forwarded. In the ideal system, only the corrected
decoded symbols will be forwarded, and for these symbols the
ideal system will combine both source’s and relay’s signals.
Therefore, the ideal system has a lower chance of making
error.
IV) The case in which the relay correctly concludes that
the frame contains no symbol error: In both the practical
system and the ideal system of Section II, the whole frame
is forwarded to the destination. In this case, both systems will
have the same detection mechanism of individual symbols in
the destination. Finally, from I, II, III, and IV, it can be easily
concluded that (23) is a lower bound for a system that uses
block error detection at the relay.
In order to optimally allocate power to training and data
transmission phases so that (23) is minimized, we formulate
an optimization problem as
(αopt, βopt, ropt) = arg min
α,β,r Pe(α, β, r)
subject to : 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, 0 ≤ β ≤ 1
(24)
where r = P1/P is the ratio of source power constraint to
total power constraint (i.e., P1 = r · P and P2 = (1 − r) · P).
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented
and compared with (23). Matlab was used for Monte-Carlo
simulation, and 108 transmitted symbols were drawn from
the BPSK constellation in order to estimate the BEP. The
node-to-node channels are modelled by zero mean independent
Gaussian random variables with unit variance.
Figure 3 shows the BEP analysis proposed in this paper
in comparison with the simulation results for M=4, 8, 16
and 64 where M is the frame length. Parameters α, β and
r = P1/P are set to 0.30, 0.30 and 0.61 respectively. As
the ﬁgure shows, all the simulation curves and analytical
expression are very close. Note that the energy allocated
to each data symbol can be obtained from (6). In order

for P/N0=30 dB we have: d64=0.0010, d16=0.0024, d8=-

little difference between the values of BEP obtained from
simulation and analytical expression.
In Figure 4, the BEP is plotted against both α and β for
P/N0=15 dB, r = 0.61, and M=4. From the derived BEP
expression (23), it is apparent that for a ﬁxed total power,
the power allocation among pilot and data affects the BEP
performance. If we allocate too much power for pilots, channel
estimation error will be reduced but because of low data SNR,
detection of the data in noise is more difﬁcult. On the other
hand, lower power for pilots results in poor channel estimation
and thus in poor detection [22], [23]. The minimum value of
BEP under P/N0=15 dB, r = 0.61 and M=4, turns out to be
at α = β = 0.35.
In Table I, the optimum values for α, β and r for M= 4,
8, 16 and 64 under P/N0 =15 dB and 25 dB are tabulated.
To obtain the optimal values of α, β and r, an optimization
problem was formulated as in (24) and solved.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have investigated the impact of channel estimation
error on the performance of a selective decode-and-forward
relay communication network that uses a practical model for
channel estimation. We have derived a lower bound expression
for the BEP performance of considered scheme. We presented
numerical simulation to show the proposed approximate an-
alytical formulation is very close to the actual BEP. It is
observed that channel estimation error causes loss of BEP
performance. For a given power budget, this loss is decreased,
by optimal power allocation between pilot symbol and data
symbols based on the lower bound expression for BEP.
This paper assumed that the destination node perfectly
knows whether the relay at each time slot is in silent mode or
not. We are currently designing the destination’s schemes for
detecting whether the relay has forwarded the symbols in the
frame or not. The study of these schemes and analyzing the
BEP performance are left for future research.
