Abstract—In Norway, a local hospital and a specialist
hospital have implemented real-time videoconferencing to
exchange knowledge in order to obtain more complete stroke
diagnoses
and
increase
the
thrombolytic
treatment
supported by specialists. In this paper, the objective is to
explore
the
tension
between
the
potential
for
using
videoconferencing and its realization in practice. In 18
months, there were four videoconferencing consultations.
Videoconferencing
is
only
used
when
considering
a
thrombolytic treatment. As the thrombolytic treatment
depends on several contra-indications written in a guideline,
the guideline shape the work practice. In principle, the
guideline represents a meaning potential for dialogue and
for exploring knowledge in stroke treatment. But, in most
cases,
the
guideline
is
followed
strictly,
and
thus
thrombolysis is not a treatment option in such cases. There is
a breakdown in the potential for using videoconferencing,
since they only four times have realized the meaning by
creating sense and a shared repertoire of knowledge. This
includes small turnouts and a lesser strictness to the
guideline
might
lead
to
more
frequently
used
videoconferencing in acute stroke treatment.

INTRODUCTION
In Norway, a local hospital and a central hospital have
both implemented real-time videoconferencing (VC) so
that
the
small
local
hospital
can
access
specialist
knowledge from the large hospital to discuss acute cases in
which patients have suffered a stroke [1]. By using VC as
a tool, practitioners are able to examine patients in a
virtual collaborative process. In acute situations, when
time is critical, this collaborative process can shorten
decision times and improve treatment outcomes.
Approximately 15,000 people in Norway suffer from
strokes each year, constituting the third most frequent
reason for death [2]. The stroke incidence is three per 1000
inhabitants [2], estimated at 69 patients per year (1,32 per
week) in this local hospital. In most cases, strokes are
treated
with
medicament
intravenous
thrombolytic
therapy. Thrombolytic therapy is a treatment used to break
up dangerous clots inside the blood vessels. To perform
this
treatment,
the
physician
injects
clot-dissolving
medications into a blood vessel. The effect of thrombolytic
treatment
diminishes
over time,
while
the
risk
for
complications
increases
[3].
Thrombolytic
treatment
should be given as soon as possible, but within 4 ½ hours
after the symptoms start [2]. As time matters, decisions
about diagnosis must be made as soon as possible.
Shortening the time to pre-hospital stoke treatment might
be possible by remotely assessing patients with stroke
prior to their arrival at the hospital through discussions
over ambulance computers [4] and through bedside
assistance from real-time video smartphones [5]. Once a
patient with a suspected stroke reaches the emergency unit,
the local hospital might use in-hospital VC to shorten the
decision process, and improve the quality of care [6].
Each
patient
needs
to
complete
a
computer
tomography (CT), an image digitizing cerebral scanning of
the brain, before an exact diagnosis is determined. The
professionals have a guideline they follow when patients
arrive at the hospital. The decision to start thrombolytic
treatment within 4 ½ hours depends on several criteria, or
contra-indications, and every case should be considered
individually. Giving stroke patients thrombolytic treatment
in the acute phase improves their prognosis. The national
goal is to give 20 % of the patients thrombolytic treatment
within 4 ½ hours after the symptoms’ debut. Today, the
average in Norway is about 5 % [7].
Many emergency physicians do not use thrombolytic
treatment, because they have a sole responsibility for the
patient
[8].
In
the
local
hospital
described
here,
thrombolytic
treatment
should
be
given
under
the
supervision
of
a
specialist.
To
access
specialist
competence
for
a
second
opinion
for
supervising
thrombolytic treatment over distance, and to save time, VC
has been implemented. Implementing VC increases the
number of thrombolytic treatments and the patients
threatened in the 4 ½ hours window [9]. Therefore, VC
can further support the decision about thrombolysis and
potentially
lead
to
an
increase
in
the
number
of
thrombolytic treatments given. In September 2010, the VC
service was ready to be used, so that the visual sight of the
patient
could
supplement
the
spoken
descriptions,
traditionally communicated by telephone. In this way, the
physicians and nurses at smaller referring hospitals could
communicate with the specialists in the specialist hospital,
seeing each other and the patient.

The paper is organized as follows. Next section gives a
background to the paper, by presenting the research
question, illuminated and made current by previously
research. Section III provides the environment where the
VC is situated, and provides a framework for analyzing
social interaction. Section IV is methods, describing the
research method and how the data is analyzed. Section V
is the results, discussed in Section VI. Conclusion and
further work are provided in the last section of the paper.
II.
BACKGROUND
Using VC in stroke treatment has been referred to as
“telestroke”. Since the end of 1990s and early 2000s,
telestroke networks have been developed. The use of
telestroke
networks
has
shown
great
promise
for
improving access to expertise and for giving more precise
diagnosis. Studies, many of which are connected to
funded programs, report outcome, i.e. factors related to
successful telestroke interventions, such as levels of
satisfaction,
acceptance,
positive
experiences
and
improved quality of care [10]. Patients treated in hospitals
with telestroke networks receive more complete stroke
diagnosis and earlier rehabilitation therapy than patients
treated in other hospitals [11]. There have been reviews
on the motivations for telestroke programs and the
barriers to program adoption [12]; the barriers are, i.e.,
lack of technology support and lack of funding [12].
Research
reporting
success
and
barriers
to
the
development
of
telestroke
programs
focus
on
the
effectiveness,
cost-effectiveness
and
quality
of
the
technology [8, 10-12]. Little is known about the use of
telestroke in daily work practice and what affects the
work processes that lead either to success or failure.
Grounded in international findings of satisfaction,
positive experiences and improved quality of care using
telestroke equipment, as well as our own results on how
VC technology per se is not the reason for the low
frequency use[13], the aim of this work is to explore why
VC use is lower than expected. Here, the paper focuses on
the work practice of stroke treatment and how the
organization of stroke treatment affects VC use in acute
care. The objective is to explore the tension between the
potential for using VC for collaborative work to increase
thrombolytic treatment and for the realization of VC in
practice.
III.
MATERIALS AND FRAMEWORK
The local hospital examined in this paper has a stroke
unit, but no neurologist. Traditionally, the physicians in
this local hospital seek a second opinion from the larger
specialist hospital over the telephone. The distance
between them is about 63 miles or 100 kilometers by
airplane over the sea. Using VC instead of a telephone
gives the specialist the opportunity to see the patient and
the local team when giving advice about treatment. In
September 2010, the service was used for the first time,
and it is still running.
The VC is located in the local hospital’s emergency
room (Figure 1). In the specialist hospital, the VC
equipment is located in a dedicated room used only for
this purpose (Figure 2). When the referring hospital calls
up the specialist hospital by telephone and initiates a VC
meeting, the specialist immediately moves to this room.
During their social interactions, the professionals are able
to draw on resources such as their different knowledge
and the patient him/herself when discussing the medical
problem. The professionals discuss and make sense of the
signs and actions that are a part of the collaborative work;
i.e., results from the CT, dialogue with the patient,
information from the physicians and the nurses.
Social interaction is a difference between meaning
potential
and
meaning
realized
[14].
The
meaning
potential in work practice is the way stroke treatment is
performed, where the blood test, the CT and the clinical
signs and information represent the potential. Through the
use of dialogue and VC, the professionals create sense
and a shared repertoire of knowledge.
When using VC the professionals meet, medical
discussions arise and problems are handled. It is the
tension and the gap-closing between the knowledge of the
local physicians, their traditional approach to stroke
treatment, and their collaboration with the specialist by
using
VC,
which
might
increase
the
number
of
thrombolytic treatments and the patients treated within the
hours window, i.e., the meaning realized.

METHODS
A.
Research methods
The VC equipment was introduced to the clinics in
September 2010, and it has been studied since. All activity
using VC is automatically logged. As a consequence, one
can know how many times, when, and for how long the
VC equipment has been used. The log data have then been
used as a basis for conducting the interviews. As the
results will show, the VC equipment logs indicated four
total uses.
Thirteen
professionals,
nurses,
physicians
and
specialists from both hospitals were interviewed, through
12 semi-structured interviews in the autumn of 2011.
There were seven informants from the local hospital and
six informants from the specialist hospital. In one of the
interviews there were two participants. The informants
were selected on the basis of their roles: working with
stroke
patients
in
the
acute
phase
and/or
having
participated in VC consultations. Five of them had used
the VC equipment. Twelve interviews were conducted
face-to-face. One interview was conducted by telephone,
since the informant
had
to
postpone the interview
appointment when visiting the hospital.
Each interview lasted from 20 minutes to two hours.
Those informants introducing the topics of equipment and
the workplace while talking affected the length of the
interviews, and made them the longest. All interviews
were audio recorded, then transcribed. All transcriptions
were categorized according to utterances that seemed to be
repeated by the practitioners.
Understanding the overall treatment of stroke patients,
in both the acute and rehabilitation phases, called for an
understanding of the organization of stroke treatment in
the
hospitals.
This
included
conversations
with
professionals involved in different stages of the stroke
treatment (the laboratory personnel, the stroke unit and CT
personnel), but as they were not the ones using the VC
equipment in the consultations, they were not included as
informants, but as a resource for understanding the
treatment of stroke patients.
B.
Analysis
All the empirical material was analyzed with emphasis
on the collaborative processes and knowledge sharing
through medical discussions. It has been important to
understand the tension between the use and the non-use of
the VC equipment; the patients that could have been
discussed by using VC, those patients who have been
discussed and why some patients are not discussed.
C.
Ethical considerations
The study has been registered and evaluated as a non-
report obliged by the North Norwegian Regional Medical
Ethics Committee (REK). The personal data are handled
according to the personal informative rules in Norway.
V.
RESULTS
A.
The work practice
The stroke patients arrives the local hospital in the
emergency room. The physician on duty meets the patient
here and considers the patient condition supported by the
nurses. If the patient has symptoms of a stroke, he/she is
considered for thrombolytic treatment. The physician
evaluates the time limit and other contra-indications for
thrombolytic treatment written in the guideline. The
patient has blood tests and a CT taken. If the physician
and the emergency team want to discuss the patient with a
specialist,
or
if the
physician
wants
to
administer
thrombolytic
treatment,
the
physician
calls
up
the
specialist at the larger hospital while the patient has the
blood tests and the CT. This is first done by telephone to
let the specialist hospital know that the local hospital want
to have a VC. Second, this is done by VC, so that both
hospitals are able to both see and hear the patient and the
whole team at the local hospital. When the patient has
finished the CT, the specialist and the local team wait by
the VC to discuss the treatment. This organization
prevents lost time by connecting the two hospitals.
Giving thrombolytic treatment depends on several
contra-indications; for instance, the time limit is 4 ½
hours, so the onset time must be known, and there are
individual criteria such as previous and present medical
conditions and medications. Therefore, every patient
needs to be considered individually. If the physician
evaluates the time limit and the contra-indications in such
way that thrombolytic treatment is not an option, the
specialist is not connected and the patient is moved to the
local medical department and later to the stroke unit for
rehabilitation.
B.
Stroke patients
During a one-year period, there were reported 12
patients suffering from a stroke in this area [3]. Only two
patients were threatened with thrombolysis. It is important
that patients are aware of the symptoms of a stroke
(informant 4, 5, 10). If the time of onset is not known, the
patient cannot receive the treatment. Following quotes
represent this:

“…we can improve our internal routines, but
most
important
is
consciousness-raising
among the public, to get in touch” informant
4.

“…the majority are non-relevant (…); they
arrive too late” informant 5.

“…the majority arrive too late (…); they do
not reach us in time” informant 10.
Also, every case must be evaluated individually, first
in terms of the time of onset and the time limit for
thrombolysis, then for other specific circumstances.

The following utterances illustrate how the physicians
(informant 8 and 12) and the specialist (informant 7)
reflect the guideline:

“…one thing we often experience is that
patients reach us too late (…) and we might
be too strict with the criteria. We might
exclude too many small turnouts” informant
8.

“…we consider it too strict (…) most of the
patients are excluded for different reasons”
informant 12.

“The question is if we are too strict. Maybe
others
have
lower
limits
for
giving
thrombolytic
treatment.
It
is
a
clinical
judgment. But, we interpret the guidelines
very differently from hospital to hospital”
informant 7.
As the utterances illustrate, the individual evaluation
of the contra-indications, or the guideline, are those cases
warranting the potential use of VC.
The contra-indications are not that strict as the time
limit, and are available for clinical discussions. These
cases, reflecting the guidelines are those where the
guideline can be discussed. The guideline are interpreted
differently from hospital to hospital (informant 7), and the
professionals say they might evaluate them too strictly
(informants 8, 12, 7), excluding too many small turnouts
(informant 8). This means, that including the small
turnouts and a lack of strict adherence to the guideline,
could have resulted in some discussions, evaluating and
exploring the standardized knowledge in the guideline.
More discussions of the guideline, further leads to more
frequently used VC consultations.
C.
The use of VC
Over the course of 18 months, VC has been used four
times to discuss stroke patients. In all four cases, the
specialist was connected because the local hospital
wanted to offer thrombolytic treatment or to discuss the
treatment because the patient was considered a possible
candidate for thrombolytic treatment.

As Table 1 illustrates, Patients 1 and 4 had their
diagnoses dismissed and changed, so no thrombolysis was
given. Patient 2 was rejected because of a previous heart
transplant, and Patient 3 had received thrombolytic
treatment successfully earlier, and then had it again. The
following quotes illustrate the treatment outcome:

“…we had the image, and were able to talk
directly to the patient. So it was easier to
evaluate the aphasia and the other parameter
as well. Because of other symptoms, we did
not do thrombolysis” informant 11.

“I am not sure this will lead to more
thrombolysis, but maybe to thrombolysis to
those
having
the
correct
indication”
informant 12.
When VC is used, it is easier to make clinical
judgments because the specialist is able to see the patient
and the overall situation. The specialist also talks to the
patient, which offers more insight into the patient’s
condition. As Informant 11 and 12 expressed, the
treatment is given under more correct indications since
VC makes it easier to evaluate all the symptoms. Even
though the specialist does not think more patients will
have thrombolytic treatment, he says that the treatment
decisions are of a higher quality.
VI.
DISCUSSION
As giving thrombolytic treatment depends on several
factors or contra-indications, the treatment guideline
shape the work practice and the use of thrombolytic
treatment. If a patient arrives more than 4 ½ hours after
symptoms start or the onset time is unknown, he/she is
not considered for thrombolytic treatment. There is also
guideline for administering thrombolytic treatment, which
are discussable and make the evaluation of every patient
unique. The guideline represents the meaning potential for
exploring knowledge in stroke treatment. But, in most
cases,
when
following
the
guidelines
strictly,
thrombolysis
is
not
a
treatment
option.
When
thrombolysis is excluded, VC is not connected and stroke
treatment is not discussed with specialists using VC.
Hence, the guideline limit dialogue and the need for
decision support. The work practice, with its routines
established in the guideline, makes the use of VC break
down.
Before the VC was implemented in 2010, the number
of patients with stroke symptoms in this local area was
estimated to be 69 patients per year. This local hospital
had 12 reported stroke patients in a one-year period
resulting
in
a
lower
number
of
candidates
for
thrombolytic treatment than estimated. By deducting
those patients who are identified within 4 ½ hours, only a
few
patients
remain
as
possible
candidates
for

45
thrombolytic treatment per year. These patients represent
the meaning potential for knowledge sharing, discussing
thrombolytic treatment and hereby the use of VC. In one
year, two patients had thrombolysis. One patient had
thrombolytic treatment with no discussion of the patient
using VC, as the local team made the decision that it was
the correct treatment. The second patient was discussed
with the specialists using VC.
Over a period of 18 months, VC has only been used
four
times.
Once,
the
outcome
was
thrombolytic
treatment. When connecting by VC, the local physicians
has
evaluated
the
patient’s
condition
and
found
thrombolytic treatment to be a possible treatment option.
Exchanging knowledge using VC as a tool resulted in
thrombolytic
treatment
on
one
occasion.
After
consultation, the stroke diagnosis was dismissed and
changed in two cases, and once, thrombolysis was refused
since the patient had a heart transplant. This illustrate that
the guideline serve as a guide, and that collaborative work
with the specialist might change and/ or influence the
decision. When discussion the patient, the meaning
potential was realized, as the professionals created a sense
and a shared repertoire of knowledge, by interacting and
drawing on each other’s resources. After the dialogue, the
exchanged knowledge had made such sense that the local
physician followed the treatment plans being discussed.
One can assume that several patient cases were the
basis for thrombolysis discussions using VC, creating a
meaning potential for expanding the knowledge exchange
and the use of VC in stroke treatment.
From a
retrospect
evaluation
of the
cases,
the
professionals determined non-thrombolytic treatment to
be the correct option. One patient could have been given
the treatment, but even though the patient did not receive
it, the patient recovered well. This illustrates that the
situation
has
the
potential
for
knowledge
sharing,
treatment modifications or corrections, and perhaps an
increased number of thrombolytic treatments. Over time,
discussing cases with may change the way the guideline is
used
in stroke treatment. The professionals strictly
evaluate the use of the guideline and their use differs from
hospital to hospital. Using VC gives the professionals
access to specialist expertise, and over time realizing the
meaning potential by exchanging knowledge so that the
guideline can be discussed and the thrombolytic treatment
can be used more frequently.
Telestroke research reports on successful telestroke
interventions,
i.e.,
satisfaction,
acceptance,
positive
experiences and improved quality of care [6]. Studies
reporting barriers explain the obstacle for use, i.e., by the
lack of technology supports and the lack of funding. This
paper discusses the processes leading to the outcome; VC
was only used four times in acute stroke treatment over a
period of 18 months. Findings illustrate how work
practice, with guideline for treatment, affects the need for
a second opinion and the use of VC as a tool for
exchanging knowledge. Accordingly, the basis for acute
stroke consultations cannot be estimated merely by the
number of stroke patients.
Lesson learned, when considering implementing VC,
the amount of patients sufficient for the investment needs
to be accounted for; i.e. the extent on knowledge sharing
and the use of VC consultations is affected by the
organization of work practice. There is a tension between
the potential for collaboration by using VC as a tool for
increasing thrombolytic treatment, and how the traditional
way of performing treatment affects the realization of VC
in practice. VC represents a tool for potential meaning
making. When the patient arrives in the emergency unit,
the professionals make decisions affecting how they
realize the meaning potential in the situation. Many
emergency
physicians
do
not
traditionally
use
thrombolytic treatment, because the rare event of giving
thrombolysis and because they have the responsibility
solely [4]. By using VC, they can consult specialists and
increase the number of thrombolytic treatments supported
by specialist
competence
[5].
Hence,
the
way the
guideline is handled affects the use and the number of
thrombolysis as treatment for stroke.
VII.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
When a stroke patient arrives at the hospital, the blood
test, the CT and the clinical signs and information
represent the potential for sharing knowledge and creating
a shared repertoire of knowledge. Through the use of
dialogue and VC, medical discussions arise and problems
are handled. The workflow affects how often and if the
dialogue using VC and the guideline are used as tools for
decision support. The professionals might create a sense
and a shared repertoire of knowledge when treatment is
discussed and carried out. Hereby, more frequent use of
VC consultations can lead to knowledge exchanges and a
greater number of thrombolytic treatments made by
confident professionals. The specialists are connected on
the
VC
after
the
physicians
have
decided
giving
thrombolysis. Therefore, only a small number of stroke
patients are discussed. Including small turnouts and
discussions about the guideline might lead to knowledge
exchange about several cases. Hereby, videoconferencing
consultations will be used more frequently in acute stroke
treatment.
It is the tension and the gap-closing between the
knowledge of the local physicians, their traditional way of
treating stroke, and their collaboration with specialists
through the use of VC, which might increase the number
of thrombolytic treatments and the patients threatened in
the hours window. Changing the work practice, by
practicing
the
knowledge
discussed
in
the
VC
consultations, realize the meaning potential in acute
stroke treatment.

Even though the VC only has been used four times for
discussing acute patients suffering from stroke, these
cases are important. The knowledge exchange by the use
of VC might have an important influence on the patient’s
condition and rehabilitation. For future work, it will be
interesting exploring the four cases and the processes of
knowledge sharing.
