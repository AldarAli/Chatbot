solutions
for
the
improvement of Human-Computer Interactions, principally
through Telemedicine Platforms in France.
First of all, we

I.
INTRODUCTION
Health is an essential sector in the digital transformation
of our entire society, using interactive devices. The Isaac’s
report [1] clearly highlighted the main challenges of this
transformation,
with
digital
technology
enabling
the
transition from curative to more predictive medicine. More
recently, Villani’s report [2] stressed the importance of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the health sector.
The question of health is linked to the territories, in
particular
with
the
subject
of
social
and
territorial
inequalities in health [3], with the concern of "medical
deserts", with issues of traceability of care acts and health
pathways, with the possible contributions of telemedicine.
In
this
paper,
we
propose
first
to
examine
the
background of the transformation of the healthcare system
and the current context of the development of telemedicine
platforms and AI. We clarify the scope and the objectives of
the survey that deals with the production and use of
healthcare data on telemedicine platforms. Then, we intend
to address, through an example, the issue of the AI
solutions
to
implement
better
Human-Computer
Interactions in telemedicine. To get a relevant picture of the
recent situation, we choose the examples amongst new
worldwide trends and French implementations. During
teleconsultations, there are no physical examinations, so
they seem somewhat like tele regulation and are required to
reduce uncertainty in diagnosis. We intend to identify how
combining AI and telemedicine may specifically support
and improve the process of a remote medical consultation.
Finally, we try to bring out the main findings concerning
technical approaches as well as other considerations.
The transformation of the French healthcare system has
become vital due to the combination of demographic
evolution and
the epidemiologic transition. With
the
decrease of infectious diseases that have led to the model of
hospital, important changes have been brought with the rise
of degenerative diseases and multi chronical pathologies. In
this context, the patients are more and more involved in
their healthcare pathway. They use search engines to get
information on Internet, they share opinions and feelings on
social networks, they interact on platforms to obtain
medical appointments and
they take charge of their
healthcare records.
With the implementation of Healthcare Information
Systems (HIS) in doctors’ offices or hospitals, important
volumes of medical data are produced. They gave rise to the
implementation of data warehouses for archiving them in
secure ways and managing their use. With multi-chronic
pathologies,
data
for
analysis
are
not
only
medical
parameters but they come from different sources, on issues
such as nutrition, habits and behavior, environment, etc.
This wide scope of data is produced by the interactions of
patients
on
digital
platforms,
characterized
as
social
technical
devices.
Moreover,
the
chronic
patients’
healthcare requires the coordination of all the healthcare
providers in the hospitals and in the ambulatory system.
The different stakeholders have to exchange information for
the organization of their patients’ healthcare pathways and
the monitoring. Medical data are produced and recorded in
the different Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) on
proprietary software and in the "Dossier médical partagé"
(DMP) in France, used till recently as repositories. But the
priority is to enable data retrieval and sharing. Healthcare
coordination should be based on interactive devices and
updated data.
In this paper, after an introduction, in Section 2, we first
define our scientific position and the methodology used.
Then, in Section 3, we present the use of data in
123

telemedicine and Artificial Intelligence data processing. In
Section 4, we consider observations on AI applications in
telemedicine through cases analysis. In Section 5, we then
analyze
the
effects
of
the
combination
of
the
two
technologies. After a discussion in Section 6, finally, we
give a conclusion focusing on main challenges tackled and
perspectives for future works.
II.
SCIENTIFIC POSITION AND METHODOLOGY
In a research-action approach, this paper associates two
researchers, one with a university position and the other
with
a
more
consulting
position
and
implication
in
experimental activities on the deployment of interactive
devices, such as AI and telemedicine projects in the
territories. Their complementarity allows for a back and
forth between theory and practice, by comparing practical
results with theoretical issues, to produce knowledge for
action.
We position our research within the interdisciplinary
field of information and communication sciences, in the
perspective outlined by F. Bernard [4], proposing to
articulate the four dimensions of links and relationships
(interactions in a systemic dimension), meaning, knowledge
and
action.
We
insist
on
the
complementarity
of
information
and
communication,
stressing
both
the
importance of information to shape organizations and data
for their management and development, and also of
communication
to
foster
change
[5],
by
promoting
cooperative
dynamics,
articulating
the
project
and
storytelling dimensions of all actors [6], both human and
socio-technical devices. We propose an approach that we
call
Information
and
Communication
Organizing
Ecosystems (ICOE). The notion of “organizing” was
proposed
by Weick [7], focusing on processes, and
interdependence of interactions, to study human activity by
means of “sensemaking recipe” in a set of dynamics to try
to
grasp
the
complexity
of
organizations.
For
us,
information and communication contribute to the shaping
and ecosystems, which can be organizations, companies,
groups or territories. We thus articulate the approaches of
Economic Intelligence and Quality [8], in the wake of
Wilensky
[9],
when
he
speaks
of
organizational
intelligence, without forgetting the innovation dimension in
process approaches [10]. In the wake of Goffman [11], we
particularly mobilize the notion of situation (situations of
activity, management, information, communication, etc.)
with all the ambivalence of technology [12]. Tensions exist
between those who are in favor of new uses of digital
technology
to
improve
patient
services,
such
as
G.
Vallancien
[13]
and
those
who
fear
regression,
rationalization
meaning
rationing
or
“uberization”
(standardization
and
precarization
of
the
health
professions), such as the National Board of Doctors or
Conseil National de l'Ordre des Médecins en France [14].
By favoring the "situational and interactionist semiotics"
reading the grid proposed by A. Mucchielli [15], we
analyze situations of activity, also integrating the dimension
of emotions and leadership [16] and trust building in
complex projects [17]. The aim is to promote new services
for
patients
and
healthcare
professionals,
with
the
importance of information (data uses) and communication
with a strong territorialization and proximity dimension,
with the emergence of new professions such as data
scientist or human data interfaces [18], with specificities in
the health sector.
III.
THE USE OF DATA IN TELEMEDICINE AND THE AI
DATA PROCESSING
We intend to examine the use of healthcare data on
telemedicine platforms and then, the AI solutions that could
improve the process. The recent trend in new technologies
is melding telemedicine with AI. Figure 1 gives an idea of
the advance of those two technologies. For getting a
comprehensive overview of the context, we can observe the
expected expansion in telemedicine and AI in the twenty
next years through the following chart extracted from a
study of the English National Health System (NHS).
Figure 1. Top 10 digital healthcare technologies and their projected
impact on the NHS workforce from 2020 to 2040 [19].
A. The Use of Data in Telemedicine
According
to
the
French
regulation
definition
(telemedicine decree: 2010), five situations or types of
telemedicine can be distinguished: tele consultation, tele
expertise, tele monitoring (for chronic diseases), tele
assistance and medical answers for emergency regulation.
The types of patients addressed by telemedicine are:

Every
patient
in
contact
with
their
general
practitioner within their healthcare pathway,

The dependent elderly,

Patients with chronic diseases: diabetes, heart
failure,
renal
failure,
Chronic
Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), etc.

Outpatients after surgery in hospital.
In terms of technological structure, a telemedicine
platform is a connecting device, where the central data
repository is related to interfaces. For teleconsultations,
there are instantly interactions between the patients and the
124

ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

doctors, who receive measurements and answers, as well as
view and analyze patient health data through a web portal.
The portal is customized for the exchanges between
stakeholders: patients and professionals, according to the
medical specialties. It can be accessed from a computer
browser or also from a smartphone on a mobile app with an
ergonomic
workflow
interface.
The
integration
of
algorithms for a preliminary analysis of medical data and
imaging is now expanding. The platform has to support the
entire process chain for providing services:

The medical appointment, linked to calendaring,

The collect of the patient’s agreement,

The stakeholders’ authentication,

The diagnosis and medical report,

The prescription (for drugs, etc.),

The data recording,

The billing and payment processes.
Usually, booking a telemedicine appointment is possible
through this interface where it can be scheduled. The
waiting line may be displayed on a dashboard, and a virtual
space organized as a waiting room for the patients.
Sometimes
documents
can
be
exchanged
beforehand
(questionnaire,
measurements,
medical
imaging,
etc.).
Recording the National Healthcare Insurance card is the
usual way to check the identity of the patient. Some other
forms can be found like the patients’ agreement and the
eligibility questionnaire. The payment system and the
online prescriptions can be supplied through the portal.
Additional services consist of the integration of the EHR for
adding data and the report of the teleconsultation, with
eventually the telemedicine video record.
The Healthcare Insurance Fund may provide a financial
aid to physicians for purchasing the following connected
devices: oxymeter, stethoscope, dermatoscope, otoscope,
glucometer,
electrocardiogram
(ECG),
doppler
device,
echograph, device for blood pressure measure, camera,
tools for ocular and hearing tests and equipment for
breathing functional exploration. As a socio technical
device,
a
telemedicine
platform
contributes
to
the
transformation of the healthcare system mainly with an
extended
use
of
data
through
Human-Computer
Interactions. As there is no physical presence for the patient
and consequently no auscultation, the doctors have to
secure their medical acts by whatever means possible.
Different types of data are needed for improving the general
process that includes mainly assessment, diagnosis and
medical prescription. Data have to be retrieved and
completed for the anamnesis, the medical case history. The
diagnosis that is sometimes based on medical imaging
requires decision support systems, as prescription too.
B. AI Data Processing and Solutions
1)
Machine
learning,
deep
learning:
With
the
implementation of EHR in hospitals and the extension of
Information Systems (IS) for the healthcare production,
medical data began to be mass produced; then, the data
management could develop with the creation of algorithms. As
data mass production reduces the limitation in the use of
statistical rules, AI devices are more and more reliable with
deep learning. They were first learning algorithms, with data
analysis (neural networks) and the capability for the machine
to deduct rules to get a result. AI applications were especially
numerous for the analysis of medical imaging, allowing the
development of diagnosis support systems, for example in
cardiology or ophthalmology,
with satisfactory rates
of
reliability. Genetics is now providing huge amounts of data,
which paves the way to the search for predictive models. Thus,
AI solutions strengthen the evolution towards a personalized,
preventive, predictive and participative medicine.
2)
Mass
production
of
healthcare
data:
Human-
Computer
Interactions
increased
with
the
patients’
empowerment, as they access more frequently social technical
devices; they not only use various search engines to get
relevant
information,
but
mainly
digital
platforms
on
computers or smartphones to know the conditions and costs of
healthcare,
getting
on
line
appointments
or
healthcare
appreciations, discussing on forums, using connected objects
or contributing to design innovative products. Data can also be
retrieved from the informal exchanges on the social media that
have become at the origin of useful information related to
healthcare (behavior, habits, ways of living, feelings). In a
more global approach towards the determinants of healthcare,
information lead to new perspectives in retrieving more data
and crossing them to build algorithms that could help to
improve the patients’ healthcare. The data integrates not only
medical, but social, psycho-social information to obtain the
signs of any evolution in the living conditions of a person and
the risks of degradation.
3)
Different uses of AI: The following figure displays the
main uses of AI in healthcare:
Figure 2. Typology of AI uses in healthcare (the mature uses are pointed
out in green) [20].
Through the main characteristic of AI, which is to
manage huge amounts of data and provide quick results, we
try to clear the applications that would especially enhance
the value of the telemedicine process, combining data
retrieval, data analysis and the decision support system.


Retrieval of the Appropriate Information: AI
applications can retrieve the patients’ information
automatically,
from
EHR
and
other
sources.
Basically, machine learning can help to analyze
clinical data in a patient’s EHR to provide patient care
recommendations.

Automatic
Analysis
of
Medical
Imaging:
AI
solutions are especially relevant for analyzing
huge masses of data from medical imaging. In
2018, DeepMind developed a software using a
neural network learning system for detecting
ophthalmic pathologies from scanner eye retina
imaging [21]. The detection focuses on age-related
macular degeneration
(AMD),
diabetic
retinopathy,
glaucoma
or
retinal
detachment.
DeepMind obtained a precision of around 94% for
the AI application it developed. Such AI solutions
in medical imaging can provide aid for diagnosis,
which helps to secure them.

AI Advice for Prescriptions: Machine learning
algorithms may recommend treatment options and
solutions for the patients.
They
help
the
doctors
when
recommending
prescriptions by taking into account the existing
ones, checking and validating prescriptions to
make sure that the drugs prescribed are compatible
with the patient’s data.
IV.
THE OBSERVATION OF AI APPLICATIONS IN
TELEMEDICINE
A. The Analysis of New Trends for AI in Telemedicine
Some applications for telemedicine now use machine
learning to help the medical professionals with diagnostic
support based on symptoms and patient health data. New
trends pivot on the capabilities and benefits of AI in
combining high speed data retrieval from very different
sources, analysis of huge amounts of data and its results
with the decision support system. AI solutions may be used
for the patients’ orientation, helping to screen patients in
telemedicine as they do for emergency calls.
B. Data Collection before a Consultation
Lemonaid Health, an AI application before virtual video
consultations: Lemonaid provides video consultations with
medical professionals [22]. It uses machine learning at the
beginning of the process with the evaluation of the patient’s
state
of
healthcare.
The
patient
has
to
complete
a
questionnaire online that includes medical history, current
medicines, allergies and regular symptoms. An AI model of
screening based on the complexity of the case analyzes the
information obtained to categorize the patient and orientate
him to the suitable healthcare provider. Doctors evaluate the
situation, usually during a video consultation available with
an assigned healthcare professional.
C.
Personalized Diagnosis Support
The telemedicine application Ada Health (Germany): A
diagnosis support for telemedicine [22] uses a machine
learning AI application to provide personalized diagnosis
support.
The patient has first to complete his medical
profile in an initial survey. A chatbot uses a series of
questions to identify possible symptoms.
D.
A Case Example of Telemedicine Using AI
1) MédecinDirect: MédecinDirect is a telemedicine
platform [23] that provides medical advice and remote
consultations through contracts with companies and mutual
funds for their stockholders. Facing the increase of the
activity in remote medical consultations, MédecinDirect
uses AI solutions in order to keep the quality level and to
reduce the length of time for providing an answer. They
fulfill two major aims: improving the anamnesis and
securing both the diagnosis and the prescribed treatment.
2) Analysis Based on the Reasons for the Consultation:
The healthcare practitioners have to ask different questions
for the clarification of symptoms and to retrieve the
patients’ medical history, without omitting to get important
information. Built on the use of a great number of
exchanges recorded on the platform, the analysis aims at
standardizing
the
different
healthcare
professionals’
answers. After the analysis of the major reason for the
consultation from natural language, AI solution proposes to
the doctor a complete set of relevant questions in order to
better define the medical case history. A conversational
agent may be integrated into the process of asking
questions.
E.
Decision Support System
AI is used for creating an inference engine that enables
the provision of medical recommendations to doctors for
the exclusion of serious risks, for making diagnosis and
assisting medical prescription.
V.
THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING TELEMEDICINE AND AI
TECHNOLOGIES
A. The Impacts for the Doctors
The processes are noticeably different between remote
medical consultations and consultations with the physical
presence of the patients. This fact explains how some
doctors are still reluctant to the practice of telemedicine. AI
and telemedicine are complementary. AI really contributes
to securing the whole process of a teleconsultation. First,
getting accurate information about the patient’s state of
health helps the professionals in their assessment. Then, any
information improving the decision-making and enabling to
confirm the appropriate diagnosis is really valued. Finally,
the prescription is much more reliable if the doctors get all
the
information
about
the
patients’ other
drugs
and
prescribed medicine. AI algorithms have to be trustworthy,
especially since they are used for healthcare. The use of AI
solutions may be time saving for doctors. They can give
them more time for doctor-patient interaction. So AI may be
a real help for doctors in the teleconsultation process, but
some challenges have still to be solved [24]; it introduces a
risk due to an insufficient accuracy in the results of AI.
Retrieving significant amount of data for the training
126
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-761-0
ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

procedure in order to create reliable algorithms is very
important. The data retrieval and their standardization are
very important factors facilitating faith in the algorithms
created.
B.
The New Scopes for the Patients
The present development of teleconsultations seems to
result not only of recent changes in regulation and of the
context of “medical desertification”, but also of the
patients’ current needs.
Some policy holders have access to telemedicine
platforms with their healthcare insurance contracts; more
patients want to avoid waiting for a medical consultation
going to the doctor’s office and use such platforms for
getting
information
fast
and
accurately.
With
the
empowerment for their healthcare, patients are more
involved in digital processes, like booking online for
medical appointments or filling in information forms before
consultations. They also communicate about their patients’
experience on social media and forums, so that they
contribute to producing data that can be retrieved for AI in
healthcare. This observation leads to the questioning
concerning the evolution towards digital medicine, with
direct access for patients to the information automatically
produced by AI, and less human interactions with the
healthcare professionals.
VI.
DISCUSSION
The interactive devices studied (AI, telemedicine) are
certainly very promising and should constitute major levers
of the digital transformation to make the health system
evolve from a purely curative and fee-for-service medicine
to a more preventive medicine, as envisaged by the Isaac’s
report [1].
We have already highlighted in the wake of J. Ellul [11],
the ambivalence of technology and the tensions between
technophiles and technophobes. In France, the Descartes’
country, engineers have always occupied a privileged place,
with the risk of technological "solutionism" drifting away
from
technocentric
approaches,
with
tools
too
often
developed without real consultation with users, whether
they are health professionals or patients and their families.
The integration of new project management methods
(known as "agile", integrating users into the various stages
of project development) such as the method for developing
trust
in
complex
projects,
for
instance the
Fears
-
Attractions - Temptations (FAcT)-Mirror method proposed
by G. Le Cardinal [17], are interesting approaches. These
tools also renew territorial approaches to health and in
particular those of health inequalities, which can have an
individual, social (isolation and poverty) and collective
dimension,
concerning
not
only
individuals,
but
the
collective dimension of territories, the question of "medical
deserts", territories without health professionals, these
"medical deserts" being also "digital deserts" [3] with
specific work on AI and rurality, data and weakened
territories or smart cities and smart territories.
Another essential aspect is the evaluation of the impact
of these new devices and their added value in improving
services for both health professionals, patients and their
families. This is another area of research we are working to
propose, still in an approach based on information and
communication issues, a more contributory evaluation by
integrating
the
expectations
and
emotions
of
all
stakeholders, tool designers, users: health professionals,
patients and their families. These patients are gradually
affirming their role with the notion of "health democracy"
enshrined in the law on "Patients' rights and the quality of
the health system" of March 2002.
All these developments imply a new “territorialization”
of health management, with an affirmation over the past
thirty
years
of
“healthcare
interface
organizations”
(healthcare networks, multi-professional healthcare centers,
home
hospitalization,
etc.)
to
overcome
the
barriers
between urban medicine and the hospitalization sector, or
new territorial groups of urban medicine, with whom there
are still challenges of coordination and traceability of acts.
All these digital transformations are also reflected in the
affirmation of new coordination professions [25] and also to
give meaning to data, not only data scientist but also human
data mediation [18]. But if we have outlined the challenges
of the digital transformation of the health system through
the
implementation
of new devices,
mainly
AI
and
telemedicine,
we
must
not
forget
the
whole
human
dimension of healthcare, well emphasized by M.J. Thiel,
with the suffering and anxiety of illness and the end of life
[26].
VII.
CONCLUSION
With the rise of more uses in telemedicine, we are
witnessing a new step in the transformation of the
healthcare system, with major challenges to overcome.
The digital process in telemedicine is a Human-
Computer Interaction, both requiring and producing data. It
contributes to the increase of the volume of healthcare data
and
therefore
to
the
possible
development
of
AI.
Telemedicine is based on data exchanges between the
stakeholders and data processing. Data collection in this
case is even more important than when there is physical
presence in a medical consultation. The doctors have to act
without any information from the patient’s auscultation.
The relevant information must be available, thus the
necessity to gather as much data as possible, i.e., recent
information, then, to select the required information and to
get support when making a decision.
The use of AI strengthens the requirements of the
information systems interoperability, as data are collected
from different sources where their meaning may be
different. Data entered into an AI system should be
complete and accurate. A healthcare data normalization
engine,
curated
and
versioned
data
sets
for
the
terminologies could be used. But in order to improve the
quality of the available data, especially with large-scale data
sources, we would need some of the standardization tools
for curating the data that do not yet exist [27][28]. A
standard
terminology,
such
as
the
Systematized
Nomenclature
for
Human
and
Veterinary
Medicine
(SNOMED)
Clinical
Terms
achieves
semantic

interoperability. Archetypes provide the shared meaning of
data with the specifications of its format.
Furthermore,
the
implementation
of
AI
solutions
highlights the complex ethical questions about the use of
medical and behavioral personal data, with the upcoming
extension to genetics. From an ethical point of view,
beyond the patients’ free consent, the use of their healthcare
data mandates a differentiated exploitation according to
their sensitivity.
The future trends may be the temptations to use AI for
services to patients without any human interaction, in
answer to their various questions about the seriousness of
the symptoms, how to understand, what to do, when seeing
a doctor is essential. We have outlined the risk of any only
“solutionist’ approach, as medicine is managing human
beings and not only materials or connected objects. The
challenges are very important and shape the whole future of
our society. Health is an essential sector to observe the
issues and challenges of the digital transformation of our
entire society.
