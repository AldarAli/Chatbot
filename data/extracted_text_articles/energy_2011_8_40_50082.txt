Abstract—This paper discusses the planning problem of a
group of domestic Combined Heat and Power (microCHP)
appliances, which together form a Virtual Power Plant (VPP).
To act on an electricity trading market, this VPP has to specify a
production plan for electricity for given times of the day to offer
to this market. These amounts have to be delivered exactly when
these times arrive; moreover, deviations from these contracts are
penalized for. We focus on the planning of individual microCHPs
for one day ahead, given that the aggregated output of the
group should fulﬁll a desired production pattern that the VPP
wants to offer on the market. The contribution in this context
is twofold. Firstly, we present a planning approach based on
column generation which calculates for all individual appliances
production patterns. The production patterns are calculated such
that the deviation of the agregated pattern of all appliances from
a prespeciﬁed pattern is minimized. Secondly, we investigate how
a desired pattern for the group can be speciﬁed based on global
parameters and which patterns can be realized afterwards by the
developed planning approach. In this way we get insight what
kind of pattern may be offered on the market. The presented
results show that we can ﬁnd near optimal solutions using a
column generation technique and that we can offer patterns with
large variation on the market, as long as the running average
does not deviate too much from the possible production.

I. INTRODUCTION
During the last years the electricity supply chain (the
production, consumption, distribution, storage and load man-
agement of electricity) has changed. Important aspects in this
change are the increase of the availability of renewable energy
sources, the development of distributed electricity generators
and the demand for more energy efﬁcient appliances [1].
A speciﬁc type of upcoming distributed electricity genera-
tors is microCHP (Combined Heat and Power on a domestic
scale). When running, a microCHP produces both heat and
electricity for household usage at the kW level. The produced
electricity can be delivered back to the electricity grid or
consumed locally. The control of the microCHP is heat led,
meaning that the heat demand of the building deﬁnes the
possible production of heat and, simultaneously, the possible
electricity output. Combined with a heat buffer, the production
of heat and electricity can be decoupled to some extent and
an operator has ﬂexibility in the times that the microCHP
is producing, which creates a certain degree of freedom in
electricity production. This freedom of electricity production
may be used to increase stability in the grid, on a large scale it
may allow to replace a conventional power plant, and more. To
effect these possibilities the individual microCHPs need to be
controlled, as standalone devices, but also in cooperation with
other microCHPs or generators in a so-called Virtual Power
Plant (VPP) (see for a German example [2]). For possible
methodologies of the control of a VPP we refer to [3], [4]
and [5].
The production of a VPP can be traded on different markets,
from which the day-ahead electricity trading market is one
option. To act on this market, the VPP has to provide an
offer a day ahead and has to matched this offer in real-time
by the group of generators the next day. In this paper we
investigate for a ﬂeet of microCHPs how to 1) use a good day
ahead planning to provide and afterwards match an offered
production and 2) derive a simple guideline on how such an
offer could look like.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, an introduc-
tion on the electricity trading market and on column generation
is given. Section III gives a more detailed formulation of the
considered problem, the way column generation is applied to
it and a derivation of a lower bound on the quality of the
achieved solutions. In Section IV, a scenario is proposed;
results are given in Section V. The paper ends with some
conclusions and future work.
II. RESEARCH FOCUS
The research in this paper focuses on the application of a
column generation technique to ﬁnd a planning for a group
of microCHPs to reach a prespeciﬁed production pattern on
the electricity trading market. To understand the idea of the
planning problem, ﬁrst a short introduction of the relevant
electricity market is given. Then the general idea of the column
generation approach is explained.
A. Electricity trading market
For electricity trading many different type of markets exist
around the world, ranging from long term trading up to real-
time balancing. For the setting considered in this paper, mainly
the day ahead markets are of interest, i.e. the markets where
electricity is traded for one day ahead, e.g., [6], [7]. In this
market electricity is traded on an hourly basis, whereas on

intraday (balancing) markets trade is on a 15 minute basis
[6]. Bids can be made for speciﬁc hours and on blocks of
consecutive hours. The electricity is traded in multiples of
100 kWh. When the market is cleared, the blocks that were
traded need to be generated on the next day as speciﬁed in
the contracts. Penalty costs are incurred when the contracts
cannot be supplied.
B. Column generation
In this paper we apply a general method called column
generation to ﬁnd a good solution for our speciﬁc optimization
problem in reasonable computation time. The idea of column
generation is to divide the given problem in two parts: a main
problem and (a) sub problem(s). The main problem consists
in principle of the original problem but reduced to a small
part of the solution space, indicated by a set of solution
vectors, the so-called ‘columns’. Based on the solution for
this (restricted) main problem, new columns are added to the
solution space, as long as they improve the objective value of
the main problem. In the sub problem(s) the new columns are
found, by optimizing on the added value of the new columns,
taking into account the current solution of the main problem.
Column generation is widely applied in practice. An exam-
ple of the use of this technique is given in [8], where it is
applied to solve the Cutting Stock Problem. It has also been
used to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem, as in [9].
III. APPROACH
The planning problem for a group of microCHPs on the
one hand focuses on the individual control of the microCHPs,
installed in (small) buildings, satisfying the local (household)
constraints, but on the other hand aims at achieving an
aggregated electricity output of the group which can be traded
on a day ahead market and, thus, has to fulﬁll speciﬁed
requirements. In general, this problem is NP-complete in the
strong sense [10].
A concrete formulation of the problem is given in Section
III-A. Next, a column generation technique is explained in
Section III-B, which is a heuristic method that is used to
solve the problem in reasonable computation time. Finally,
in Section III-C lower bounds are derived for the problem,
to analyze the quality of the developed heuristic method and
to analyze the impact of choices for a speciﬁc offer on the
electricity trading market.
A. Problem formulation
The main objective for a VPP, when acting on a market,
is to maximize its proﬁt (or revenue). For this, the VPP has
to decide on which times of the day it wants to produce
how much electricity. The overall amount of electricity a
VPP consisting of a group of microCHPs can offer to the
market is limited by the individual production capacities of
the microCHPs. These can be calculated based on predictions
of the local heat demand. However, for trading, not only the
overall capacity of the VPP but it’s deviation over the time
periods of a day needs to be speciﬁed to be able to act on
the day ahead market. For this, a planning of the production
of all individual microCHP’s is needed. This planning may be
steered by bounds on the overall production proﬁle, whereby
these bounds result from possible ways to act on the market.
A feasible planning of a microCHP naturally should respect
the individual heat demand within the building where the
microCHP has been installed. In addition, the total electricity
production should be within the given bounds resulting from
possible actions on the market. The goal of the planning
problem in this paper is to ﬁnd such a feasible planning, in
contrast to a planning with the objective of maximizing proﬁt
in the market.
Let microCHPs i = 1, . . . , N be given and let the time hori-
zon of 24 hours be discretized in time intervals j = 1, . . . , NT .
Furthermore, let P be the set of possible binary production
patterns for the type of microCHP that is used. These pat-
terns do not take into account heat demand requirements or
total desired electricity production, but include the (technical)
restrictions of the microCHP. Note that the set P can be
extremely large.
In general, the offered bounds on the market (i.e., the
desired production pattern) are represented by upper and
lower bound vectors P upper = (P upper
1
, . . . , P upper
NT
) and
P lower = (P lower
1
, . . . , P lower
NT
). These vectors specify per
time period a lower and upper bound on the total production
of the microCHPs that should be generated during that time
period. A pattern p ∈ P for a microCHP is deﬁned as a binary
vector p = (p1, . . . , pNT ) where pj ∈ {0, 1} speciﬁes whether
the microCHP is on or off. The problem is to pick exactly one
pattern for each microCHP, such that the sum of all production
patterns falls between the lower and upper bound of the desired
production pattern in all time intervals. For this, let Fi ⊂ P be
a subset of all possible production patterns that takes the local
heat demand into account of the building where microCHP
i is installed, in case that a heat buffer is used. Thus, this
set speciﬁes the locally feasible patterns for microCHP i. The
choice for using this set is explained in Section III-B, where
we restrict ourselves to solving the problem by only using
those production patterns that can supply the heat demand.
The planning problem for the VPP now can be formulated
by the following Integer Linear Program (ILP):

j=1

(6)
where yip is a binary decision variable indicating whether
pattern p ∈ P is chosen for generator i (in this case yip = 1)

or not (yip = 0). In Equations (2) and (3) slack and excess
variables slj and exj are introduced to calculate the devi-
ation from the desired (and predeﬁned) production pattern
(P upper, P lower). The sum of slack and excess variables is
minimized in Equation (1). Finally, Equation (4) requires that
exactly one pattern is chosen for each generator.
A feasible planning is achieved when the sum of slack and
excess variables equals 0. If no feasible planning can be found,
the objective value is a measure of the deviation from the
desired production pattern.
B. Column generation
The problem formulated by equations (1)-(6) takes into
account locally feasible production patterns from the sets Fi.
These sets however are still very large and, therefore, it is
already difﬁcult to solve the problem for instances with 10
microCHPs if all possible patterns are added to the sets Fi
[11]. For this reason a column generation technique is applied.
The column generation technique starts with a relatively
small set of feasible patterns Si ⊂ Fi for each microCHP i.
By looking at only a small set of patterns the problem can
be solved relatively fast. However, this comes with a possible
loss of patterns that are necessary for a high quality solution.
The VPP might perform better, when some feasible production
patterns from Fi not in Si would be added to the set Si.
Unfortunately, we do not know on beforehand which patterns
are useful in the ﬁnal solution. Therefore it is the idea of the
column generation technique to improve the current solution
step by step, by searching for those patterns which promise
to improve the current solution, and by adding these patterns
to the (small) feasible pattern sets Si of the corresponding
microCHPs. We have chosen to expand the pattern set Si by
at most one pattern per iteration as the heuristic evolves.
The column generation technique uses a main problem and
sub problems as indicated in Algorithm 1. The main problem
is similar to equations (1)-(6), with the only difference that
the set Fi is replaced by Si:
min
NT
X
j=1
(slj + exj)
(7)
N
X
i=1
X
p∈Si
pjyip + slj ≥ P lower
j
j = 1, . . . , NT
(8)

p∈Si
pjyip − exj ≤ P upper
j
j = 1, . . . , NT
(9)
X
p∈P
yip = 1
i = 1, . . . , N
(10)
slj, exj ≥ 0
j = 1, . . . , NT
(11)
yip ∈ {0, 1}.
(12)
The second phase of the column generation technique con-
sists of creating new patterns that can be added to the current
pattern sets Si for each microCHP in the main problem. These
new patterns should contribute to the existing sets in the sense
that they must give possibilities to decrease the objective value
in the ﬁrst phase (i.e., the sum of slack and excess). A new
pattern p is only added to Si if it 1) promises to improves the
existing solution and 2) is a locally feasible pattern (p ∈ Fi).
Let λj represent the shadow prices for equations (8) and (9),
obtained from the optimal dual solution of the linear relaxation
of (7)-(12). A pattern p only may improve the existing relaxed
solution if:
NT
X
j=1
λjpj > 1.
(13)
However, this does not necessarily mean that this pattern can
be automatically selected in the new solution of the main
problem, since newly added patterns of other microCHPs (by
solving these sub problems) can lead to different choices for
this speciﬁc microCHP. As a consequence, the main problem
has to be solved for the new sets Si completely in each
iteration.
The second requirement (p is locally feasible) has not been
formalized yet. The reason for this is that the constraints that
we use for forcing this requirement are only used in the sub
problem of the column generation technique. For the main
problem it sufﬁces to know that the patterns have been checked
for feasibility before; these feasible patterns are given input
data for the main problem. The feasibility check is controlled
by using two parameter sets, specifying in each interval j
the minimum production the microCHP generator i should
have generated (MinOnij) and the maximum production
the generator could have generated (MaxOnij) up to and
including the current interval. These parameters MinOni,j
and MaxOni,j are ﬁxed in such a way that they fulﬁll
technical runtime/off-time constraints of the microCHP and
the heat demand requirements of the building (for details see
[10]). Startup and shutdown phases are neglected.
Summarizing, the sub problems of the column generation
are given by the following ILP formulation for all microCHPs
i:
max

X
j=1
λjpj
(14)

k=1
pk ≤ MaxOnij
j = 1, . . . , NT
(15)
j
X
k=1
pk ≥ MinOnij
j = 1, . . . , NT
(16)
pj ∈ {0, 1}
j = 1, . . . , NT ,
(17)
where from all locally feasible patterns the one is chosen that
maximizes the added value to the main problem. If constraint
(13) is satisﬁed, the pattern p is added to the set Si.
To summarize, the solution method is given in Algorithm
1. In each iteration, the main problem is solved ﬁrst, after
which for each microCHP the sub problem is solved and new
feasible and improving patterns are added. If at least one sub
problem leads to an improvement, the routine is repeated.
C. Lower bound of the objective
The lower and upper bounds P lower and P upper (repre-
senting the desired production pattern) and the possible pro-
duction bounds MaxOni and MinOni form the basic input

The calculation of the lower bound of the group planning problem
parameters of a problem instance. To derive a lower bound
zLB for the objective of the main problem, we concentrate on
these parameters. Since we have a minimization problem and
the sum of slack and excess variables cannot be negative, the
theoretical lower bound zLB is at least 0.
The calculation of the lower bound works in phases. In each
phase a minimal guaranteed mismatch (slack or excess) zextra
LB
is found and added to the current lower bound.
In the ﬁrst phase, the additional value of the lower bound
zextra
LB
equals:

This value equals the maximum deviation of the aggregated
possible production from the aggregated desired production
pattern. An example of this phase is shown in Figure 1(a),
where the aggregated minimal mismatch per time interval
is given by the gray area. In this example, the maximum
difference between the maximal possible production and the
minimal desired production is found at time 7.5, with a value
of 93. So, in this example, the lower bound has now improved
from 0 to 93.
The ﬁrst value of j for which zextra
LB
is found is the
starting point r for the calculation of the next phase. This
starting point is important in two ways. First, the mismatch
in previous intervals cannot be undone, if we only look
at intervals j > r. Secondly, the starting point r offers a
natural reset point; the sum of desired maximum (minimum)
production upto and including interval r can be replaced by the
maximum (minimum) possible production upto and including
interval r. Other reset values either are not allowed (these
total productions are not possible at r) or would increase the
value of zextra
LB
. Considering the second option, these values
do not represent the lower bound, since the chosen reset
values are reachable (at least in the lower bound calculation)
and give a smaller mismatch. So, Pj

IV. SCENARIO
In this section, some computational results achieved with
the presented approach are given. For this, a scenario is set up
to answer two kinds of problems. First, the deﬁned instances
should provide a framework to test the quality of the column
generation technique. Secondly, the instances should give an
indication of the type of pattern that qualiﬁes for being offered
on the electricity trading market.
To support both questions, we focus on variation in the
offered/desired patterns and keep the possible total production
constant. The variation is created by adding a sine function to
a constaint proﬁle, where we vary both amplitude and period
of the sine function, i.e. the sine function characterizes the
variation of the proﬁle.
The instances consist of a group of 100 microCHPs and
a discretization of the one day time horizon into 48 time
intervals. Although this group size is too small to be able to act
on the electricity market at the moment (microCHPs generates
at the 1 kW level), this size already gives a good indication
of the possibilities of the planning method. Decisions are
made on an half an hour basis. The discretization in half
hour periods is more ﬁne grained than required, since the day
ahead electricity market works on an hourly basis, however,
for this granulation the planning problem gets more realistic
(and more difﬁcult). If needed, the production patterns can be
simply converted to hourly blocks.
The maximum and minimum possible production MaxOni
and MinOni are chosen to differ per microCHP, i.e. the
heat demand differs per building. The aggregated values of
all microCHPs are already given in Figure 1.
The initial patterns in the sets Si are derived from the
parameters MaxOni and MinOni. Each microCHP sub
problem starts with two patterns, one resulting from the earliest
possible time intervals that the microCHP can be switched on,
and one resulting from the latest possible time intervals that
the microCHP has to be switched on.
Upper and lower bounds of the desired production are
deﬁned as follows. The upper bound P upper is derived from
the highest integer value of µupper for which a given amplitude
amp and period per result in a total desired production
that is still feasible, when only looking at the total possible
production:
max µupper
(20)
X
j
P upper
j
≤
X
i
MaxOni,NT
(21)
P upper
j
= rnd(amp × sin(f(per) × j)) + µupper∀j, (22)
where f(per) is the frequency corresponding to the given
period per and rnd() is a rounding function. Likewise, the
lower bound P lower results from the lowest sine curve ﬁtting
in the possible minimum production:
min µlower
(23)
X
j
P lower
j
≥
X
i
MinOni,NT
(24)
P lower
j
= rnd(amp × sin(f(per) × j)) + µlower∀j. (25)
Looking at the ﬁnal time interval in Figure 1(a), we can
conclude that the lower and upper bound of the example ﬁt
within the possible total production domain. Figure 2 gives
the corresponding resulting individual values.
Based on the above, an instance is deﬁned as a pair
I(amp, per) and a solution can be characterized by a tuple
(I(amp, per), zLB, zfound). For this paper, we choose amp ∈
{0, 1, . . . , 40} and per ∈ {2, 3, . . . , 24}.
V. RESULTS
Figure 3 shows the lower bound and the best found solutions
for the deﬁned instances. The lower bound is plotted as a
surface plot, whereas the found solutions are given as dots in
the ﬁgure. For the example used throughout this paper, the
found optimization value is 176.5, whereas the lower bound
is 176, close to the lower bound.
In general, the column generation technique ﬁnds solutions,
which are close to the derived lower bounds of the objective
value. This means that when the total production capacity of
the microCHPs is known and the variations on the average
production per time interval is not to extreme, the column
generation technique can ﬁnd actual assignments of individual
patterns to match the pattern. However, for small amplitudes
the difference between the lower bound and the found value
can be relatively large. The inability to ﬁnd better patterns for
these instances is probably due to the simple choice for the
initial patterns in the sets Si.
Regarding the quality of the eventual production pattern,
Figure 3 shows that the period has the most inﬂuence on
the deviation from the desired pattern. For small periods, the
mismatch stays relatively low, even for large values of the
amplitude. This indicates that we may use large variation in
our market offer, as long as the sum of positive and negative
deviations from the possible production is close to zero.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In this paper, we have presented an application of the
column generation technique to the planning problem of
a group of microCHPs. This technique ﬁnds near optimal
solutions for a large fraction of the deﬁned instances. It is
possible to specify in advance a desired output pattern, which
is calculated based only on global parameters, and afterwards
create individual patterns which combine to an output of the
whole group, which is close to the desired output. This enables
the group to act on the electricity trading market by only using
global information.
As a guideline to what kind of production pattern the group
should offer on the market, we can state the following: large
variations may occur, as long as they are ’corrected’ in close-
by intervals. In other words, we can offer patterns with large
variation on the market, as long as the running average does
not deviate too much from the possible production.
Future work - In future work, the inﬂuence of the initial
pattern set on the resulting quality of the overall solution
should be investigated. We believe that by a better choice the
results also for small amplitudes improve.
In the current implementation of the column generation
technique we neglected startup and shutdown times, opposite
to the work in [11]. It is of interest to see the impact of adding
these requirements, which results in a more accurate modeling
of the electricity production.
Finally, to be able to trade on a real market, the group size
has to increase. It has to be validated if the proposed planning
method also works for these larger groups.
