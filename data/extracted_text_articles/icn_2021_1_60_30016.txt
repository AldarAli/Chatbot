Abstract—In this paper, we present an analytical model to reuse 
spectrum in the Terahertz (THz) band in small cells located within 
a building. We characterize Co-Channel Interference (CCI) in the 
140 GHz band and derive a minimum distance between co-channel 
small cells subject to satisfying predefined CCI interference 
constraints in both intra-floor and inter-floor levels. The set of 
small cells in both intra-floor and inter-floor levels constitute a 3-
Dimensional (3D) cluster of small cells. The whole THz spectrum 
allocated to a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) can be reused to 
small cells of each cluster. We derive system-level average 
capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy Efficiency (EE) 
metrics for an arbitrary number of L buildings of small cells 
located over a macrocell coverage. With extensive numerical and 
simulation results and analyses, we show that the 3D clustering of 
small cells in a building and reusing the same spectrum in the 140 
GHz band to each cluster improve both the SE and EE 
performances. Further, it is shown that the expected SE and EE 
requirements for the future Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile 
networks can be achieved by reusing the spectrum in a fewer 
number of buildings of small cells than that required when no 
spectrum reuse is considered.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Radio spectrum in mobile wireless communications is scarce 
and very costly. A direct, yet effective, way to improve the 
network capacity of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) is to 
increase the system bandwidth by aggregating spectra in 
different bands. In this regard, due to the availability of large 
spectrum availability, high-frequency spectra in the range of 
millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands and Terahertz (THz) bands 
are considered to operate small cells deployed within a building. 
Even though, the Fifth-Generation (5G) mobile network has 
been rolled out in many countries in several mmWave spectrum 
bands, including 28 GHz and 39 GHz, the future Sixth-
Generation (6G) is expected to operate in even higher 
frequencies such as THz bands. Due to their operational and 
signal propagation characteristics, including high distant-
dependent path loss, low transmit power, small coverage, and 
presence of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) components, both mmWave 
and THz bands are suitable to serve indoor coverage.  
Another major approach to improve the network capacity is 
to reuse the same spectrum spatially more than once. In this 
regard, due to high penetration losses from external and internal 
walls, as well as floors in a building, the high-frequency 
spectrum can be reused suitably by forming a 3-Dimensional 
(3D) cluster of small cells subject to managing Co-Channel 
Interference (CCI) between co-channel small cells. The whole 
spectrum can be reused to small cells per 3D cluster. However, 
comprehensive modeling of interference, as well as clustering of 
small cells, for reusing spectrum in them under the in-building 
scenario are not obvious. To the best of our knowledge, we first 
addressed these issues by modeling CCI and defining a 
minimum distance between co-channel small cells in a building 
in both intra-floor and inter-floor levels to develop a 3D cluster 
of small cells in order to reuse the same spectrum in each cluster 
in the 2 GHz microwave band Saha [1]. Likewise, in Saha [2], 
we dealt with managing CCI between co-channel small cells in 
the 28 GHz and 60 GHz mmWave bands to reuse both spectra 
in each 3D cluster of small cells. Due to considerable differences 
in 
operational 
requirements 
and 
signal 
propagation 
characteristics from the microwave and mmWave bands, 
following the continuation in Saha [1] and Saha [2], in this 
paper, we model CCI in the 140 GHz THz band to define a 3D 
cluster of in-building small cells in order to reuse the THz 
spectrum of an MNO in each 3D cluster.  
In doing so, firstly, we discuss the system architecture and 
140 GHz, indoor loss model, in Section II. We then present in 
brief CCI in both intra-floor level and inter-floor levels of a 
building and deduce minimum distances between co-channel 
small cells in both levels. A 3D cluster of small cells is then 
defined subject to satisfying both intra-floor and inter-floor 
interference constraints set by an MNO. The whole spectrum in 
the 140 GHz band is then reused to each 3D cluster of small 
cells. We derive system-level average capacity, Spectral 
Efficiency (SE), and Energy Efficiency (EE) metrics in Section 
III. In Section IV, we define parameters and assumptions, 
evaluate the impact of 3D clustering of in-building small cells, 
and compare the system-level SE and EE performances of the 
MNO with the corresponding expected requirements for the 6G 
mobile networks. We conclude the paper in Section V.   
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND THZ INDOOR LOSS MODEL  
A. System Architecture    
We consider a simple system architecture of an MNO, i.e., 
MNO 1, in a country as shown in Figure 1(a), which has three 
types of Base Stations (BSs), including Macrocell BS (MBS), 
Picocell BS (PBS), and Small cell BS (SBS). MBSs and PBSs 
operate in the 2 GHz spectrum, whereas all SBSs located in 
buildings are operated in the 140 GHz spectrum. Figure 1(a) 
also shows the placement of SBSs at the center of the ceiling of 
each apartment in a building. Each SBS serves one User 
Equipment (UE) at a time. An illustrative clustering in the inter-
floor level (a single floor) and intra-floor level (nine

B. 140 GHz Indoor Loss Model  
1) Indoor path loss model: We consider the LOS path loss 
model for indoor THz communications in the 140-150 GHz 
band such that the average path loss at a distance d can be 
expressed as follows [3].

2) 140 GHz floor attenuation loss model:  The floor 
penetration loss is not linear and decreases with an increase in 
the number of floors. Moreover, the floor attenuation loss is 
frequency-dependent and increases with an increase in 
frequency. In general, experimental signal propagation studies 
and results in the THz band are very limited in the existing 
literature. Hence, if we consider a reinforced concrete floor, 
according to [4], the floor attenuation loss is above 50 dB for 
31

the first floor at 28 GHz. Since the floor attenuation loss 
increase with an increase in frequency, the loss at 140 GHz 
must be higher than 50 dB for the first floor. The impact of CCI 
at this floor attenuation loss of more than 50 dB for the first 
floor at the 140 GHz is negligible in the adjacent floor, and 
hence we assume no CCI interference effect from one adjacent 
floor to another at the 140 GHz band.

Due to the high operating frequency and the low 
transmission power of each small cell, we consider similar 
indoor signal propagation characteristics for all L buildings per 
macrocell. Then, by linear approximation, the system-level 
average capacity per macrocell of MNO 1 is given by the sum 
of the aggregate capacity of all macrocell UEs served by the 
macrocell and picocells and the aggregate capacity of all small 
cell UEs served by small cells in L buildings. Hence, using (12) 
and (15), the system-level average capacity per macrocell of 
MNO 1 is given by

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND COMPARISON  
     Default parameters and assumptions used for the evaluation 
are given in Table I. Note that due to low output power and high 
propagation loss, the coverage of THz signals is limited [6]. To 
overcome these constraints, high-gain antennas at both ends are 
required. Hence, following [3], we consider horn antennas at 
the transmitting and receiving ends each with a gain of 21 dB.

cells. Hence, for a 6-story building with each floor having 9 
apartments, the 140 GHz spectrum can be reused 6 times.   
Figure 2 shows the SE and EE responses due to reusing 50

. Clearly, it can be found that clustering 
small cells in the 140 GHz band and reusing the same spectrum 
more than once improve both SE and EE performances. 
Further, it is expected that the 6G mobile systems will require 
10 times average SE [10] (i.e., 270-370 bps/Hz), as well as 10-
100 times average EE [11] (i.e., 0.03×10-6 to 0.3×10-6 
Joules/bit), of 5G mobile systems [12]-[13]. Now, from Figure 
2, it can be found that the expected average SE and EE can be 
satisfied by reusing the spectrum to less number of buildings of

spectrum reuse is considered.

V. CONCLUSION  
      In this paper, we have presented an analytical model to 
reuse Terahertz (THz) spectrum to small cells of an MNO. All 
small cells are deployed within buildings and operate only in 
the 140 GHz band. Interference from one small cell to another 
due to reusing the 140 GHz spectrum has been modeled both 
intra-floor and inter-floor levels and the corresponding 
minimum distance between co-channel small cells have been 
derived. These minimum distances in the intra-floor and inter-
floor level provide the size of a 3D cluster of small cells. We 
have derived average capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and 
Energy Efficiency (EE) performance metrics.  Extensive 
simulation and numerical results analyses have been carried 
out. 
      It has been found that the 3D clustering of in-building small 
cells, and reusing the same spectrum in the 140 GHz band to 
each cluster improve both the SE and EE performances. 
Moreover, both inter-building reuse factor and intra-building 
reuse factor have an impact on the overall performance 
improvement. Finally, we have shown that the presented model 
can satisfy the prospective SE and EE requirements for the 
Sixth-Generation (6G) networks by reusing the spectrum in less 
number of buildings of small cells than that required when no 
spectrum reuse is considered in the 140 GHz.
