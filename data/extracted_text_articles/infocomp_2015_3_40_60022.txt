Abstract—Ultrasonic image is an imaging technique that is
commonly used for medical diagnostics. Unfortunately, the quality
of ultrasonic images is limited, mainly due to speckle noise.
Speckle noise reduction is one of the most important processes
in enhancing the quality of ultrasonic images. In this paper,
an adaptive noise reduction technique in wavelet domains for
ultrasonic images is studied. First, a logarithmic transformation
is performed on an original ultrasonic image in order to convert a
multiplicative noise to an additive one. Next, Stationary Wavelet
Transform is used to decompose the image resulting from the ﬁrst
step into four subbands. Then, an adaptive Wiener ﬁlter is applied
to all detailed subbands in order to suppress additive noises in
these subbands. Subsequently, the reconstructed image is derived
by performing an inverse Stationary Wavelet Transform on those
resulting subbands and following by an exponential transfor-
mation. The performance of the studied algorithm is evaluated
objectively and subjectively on several ultrasonic images and it is
compared against several well-known methods, such as Median
ﬁlter, Wiener ﬁlter, Discrete Wavelet Transform based on soft
thresholding, and Discrete Wavelet Transform along with Wiener
ﬁlter. The results clearly demonstrate the superior performance
of the studied method in terms of signal to mse ratio (S/mse),
edge preservation (β) values as well as perceptible image quality.

INTRODUCTION
Ultrasound imaging is predominant and plays an important
role in medical diagnosis because it is a noninvasive, nonra-
dioactive, real-time and inexpensive modality [1]. However,
ultrasonic images usually suffer from three component kinds
of noises. The ﬁrst arises from the electronics of the detection
system. For instance, the signal intensity of the backscattered
ultrasound signals is affected by the operating frequency
of the transducer: the higher the frequency, the greater the
tissue attenuation, which therefore produces a lower signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR). The second source, speckle, corresponds
to coherent wave interference in tissue. It is well known to
be signal-dependent in ultrasound imaging systems. The ﬁnal
term, clutter, is applied to signals arising from side lobes,
multipath reverberation, and tissue motion that add noise to
the ultrasound images [1].
Over the years, speckle noise suppression has been widely
studied and considered. When ﬁltering random noise from an
image, there are two main issues to be considered: how much
noise has been removed, and how well edges are preserved
without blurring. Traditionally, there are several simple tech-
niques for noise suppression, such as a moving average ﬁlter
and Gaussian ﬁlter. Being merely low-pass ﬁlters, they can
effectively suppress noise, but they fail to preserve many useful
details [2]. For speckle noise reduction techniques, some of
the well-known ﬁlters include Lee ﬁlter, Kuan ﬁlter, median
ﬁlter, and homomorphic Wiener ﬁlters
[3]–[5]. These ﬁlters
can effectively suppress speckle noise, but they fail to sufﬁ-
ciently preserve the edges. In the past decade, there has been
considerable interest in using Wavelet transform as a powerful
tool for recovering signal from noisy data. This method is
generally referred to as a wavelet shrinkage technique. In
1995, D. L. Donoho presented a soft threshold method for
denoising in one dimensional signal [6]. S. Chang, B. Yu and
M. Vetterli introduced an adaptive wavelet threshold for image
denoising and compression. They proposed a new shrinkage
method, BaeyShrink [7], which also outperformed Donoho
and Johnstone’s Sureshrink [8]. Furthermore, other authors
proposed probabilistic methods for speckle noise reduction
in the wavelet domain [9]–[12]. Recently, A. K. Gupta and
D. Sain have proposed a speckle reduction technique using a
logarithmic threshold contourlet [13]. The method proposed
by C. Barcelos and L. Vieira used an adaptive edge-controlled
variation function to detect and reduce speckle noise [14].
Another proposed approach uses adaptive block-based singular
value decomposition for speckle noise suppression [15].
In this paper, an adaptive noise suppression technique
for ultrasonic images is proposed. The studied method is a
preprocessing step for speckle noise reduction, before ap-
plying a feature extraction process [16]. First, a logarithmic
transformation is applied to an original image in order to
convert the multiplicative noise into additive noise. Next,
Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) is used to decompose
the transformed image resulted from the ﬁrst step into four
subbands. SWT is a wavelet transform algorithm that do not
decimated but instead padding the ﬁlters with zeros [17].
That is, all the subband images would have the same size
as the original images. Therefore, it has several advantages,
as compared to Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). First,
the transformation is translation-invariance. In addition, there
is no information loss in each subband, since there is no
downsampling process, unlike DWT. Then, an adaptive Wiener
ﬁlter is applied to all the detailed subbands. An adaptive
Wiener ﬁlter is a well-known ﬁltering technique that has been
applied not only to reduce stationary noise in noisy images
but also to suppress blocking artifacts [18]. As a result, a
reconstruct images derived from the studied method would
be smoother, as compared to other ﬁltering techniques, e.g.,
a block-based SVD based approach [15]. Finally, an inverse

SWT is computed and applied to the exponential transfor-
mation to reconstruct the denoised image. Then, in order to
evaluate the performance of the studied method, the quality
of reconstructed images derived from the studied method is
compared against other existing approaches, such as median
ﬁlter, Wiener ﬁlter, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), based
on soft thresholding, and DWT coupled with Wiener ﬁlter.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
a studied method for speckle noise reduction is described in
details. Then, the quantitative image quality measurements
and experimental results are given in Section III and IV
respectively. Finally, the conclusion remarks are provided in
Section V.
II.
STUDIED METHOD
Similar to homomorphic Wiener ﬁltering, the studied
method could be used to reduce a speckle noise in medical
images, which is done in the SWT domain. The block diagram
of studied method is illustrated in Figure 1. Details are as
follows:
•
Take a logarithmic transformation to the original im-
age (f), which yields image result (g).
•
Perform a 2-D SWT on the log transformed image in
order to decompose the transformed image g into four
subbands (LL, LH, HL and HH).
•
Perform a 2-D adaptive Wiener ﬁlter only in the
detailed subbands (LH, HL and HH), window size of
7x7 is chosen which yields the image result ( ˆY ).
•
Apply the inverse 2-D SWT which yields a denoised
image (ˆg).
•
Take the exponential transformation of the denoised
image to get the reconstructed image ( ˆf).
The two main components of this method: 2-D stationary
wavelet transform and adaptive wiener ﬁlter, are described
below.
A. 2-D stationary wavelet transform
Unlike the conventional Discrete Wavelet Transformer
(DWT), the two dimensional Stationary Wavelet Transformer
(2-D SWT) is based on the idea of no decimation, which
means the SWT is translation-invariant [19]. It applies the
DWT and omits both down-sampling in the forward and
up-sampling in the inverse transformation. 2-D SWT can
be implemented by ﬁrst applying the DWT along the rows
of an image, and then applying it on the column of an
image. Therefore, a transformed image is decomposed into
four subbands, which are the same size as the original image.
The LL band contains the approximation coefﬁcients, the LH
band contains the horizontal details, the HL band contains
the vertical details and the HH band contains the diagonal
details. Without translation-invariance, slight shifts in the input
signal will produce variations in the wavelet coefﬁcients that
might introduce artifacts into the noise reduction process. This
property is good for noise removal because the noise is usually
spread over a small number of neighbouring pixels. The 2-D
SWT decomposition scheme is illustrated in Figure 2.
B. Adaptive wiener ﬁlter
Two dimensional Wiener ﬁlter is a minimum mean-square
error ﬁlter [20]. It is a nonlinear spatial ﬁltering that moves a
window or kernel over each pixel in the image, computes and
replaces the central pixel values under the window. It uses a
collection of window sizes to estimate the noise power from the
local image mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). The output
of 2-D Wiener ﬁlter [21] [22] is deﬁned by:
ˆY (xi, yj) = µ + σ2 − v2
σ2
× (Y (xi, yj) − µ)
(1)
where µ and σ2 represents the local mean and standard
deviation obtained from the noisy image window respectively.
Y is the noisy pixel and ˆY is the ﬁltered pixel. Also, v
is the noise variance, estimated from the average of all the
local estimated variances in the image. Note that, only an odd
number should be used as the size of the kernel. If the size
is too large, important feature will be lost. On the other hand,
if the size is too small, noise reduction may not yield good
results. In general, a kernel size of 3x3 and 7x7 provides good
results [13].
III.
QUANTITATIVE QUALITY MEASURES
To quantify the achieved noise reduction ability perfor-
mance, there are two main issues to be considered, which
are how much noise has been removed, and how well edges
are preserved without blurring. In the past decade, there have
been many quantitative quality measurements proposed. In
this research study, three image quality measurements: Mean
Square Error (MSE), Signal to MSE ratio (S/mse), and edge
preservation (β) are computed using original and reconstructed
image data [23] [24].
A. Mean Square Error (MSE)
MSE =
1
mn
m,n
X
i,j=1
( ˆSi,j − Si,j)2
(2)
Where n and m are image dimension. ˆS and S are referred
to reconstructed and original images, respectively. The higher
MSE value denotes the lower image quality.
B. Signal to MSE ratio(S/mse)
To evaluate speckle noise reduction, a Signal to MSE ratio
(S/mse) is used, instead of the standard signal to noise ration.
It is deﬁned as below:
S
MSE = 10 log10

mn
Pm,n
i,j=1(S2
i,j)
MSE
(3)
The lower S/mse means the lower image quality.
C. Edge preservation (β)
To consider the performance of edge preservation, a pa-
rameter β based on a correlated operation between original
and reconstructed images is used and given by:
β =
Γ(∆s − ¯
∆s, ∆ˆs − ¯
∆ˆs)
p
Γ(∆s − ¯
∆s, ∆s − ¯
∆s)Γ(∆ˆs − ¯

where

∆s and
¯
∆ˆs) are the mean values in the region of
interest(ROI) si,j and ˆsi,j respectively. Also, ∆s and ∆ˆs rep-
resent the high pass ﬁltered operation of s and ˆs, respectively,

tion ability of the reconstructed image.

EXPERIMENTS
In this part of the experiment, to validate the performance
of the studied method, various cholecystitis ultrasonic images
are used, as shown in Figure 3. The image size is 256x256.
A number of experiments were conducted and compared with
other traditional methods, which were 2-D median ﬁlter (7x7),
2-D adaptive Wiener ﬁlter (7x7), DWT with soft thresholding,
and DWT along with Wiener ﬁlter. The experiments reported
in this section have been tested using MATLAB 10.0 - R2010b
(64 bit). All the wavelet-based techniques used Daubechies 4
wavelet basis, with one level of DWT and SWT decomposition.
In fact, noise is generally spread over in detailed subbands, due
to the components of highpass wavelet ﬁlters. Therefore, the

2-D adaptive Wiener ﬁlter is applied only in detailed subbands.
To quantify the achieved performance in terms of the ability of
speckle noise reduction and edge preservation, three original
cholecystitis ultrasonic images, as illustrated in Figure 3, are
used. These images are ﬁrst corrupted with noise at variance
of 0.08 where the noisy images are depicted in Figure 4(a).
Then, different speckle noise reduction techniques are applied
on these noisy images. Then, the quality of reconstructed
images are evaluated using S/mse and β. The numerical
results, presented in Table I, show that the proposed approach
outperforms other methods in terms of S/mse and β.
To visually compare with all other methods, the compara-
tives of various results are shown in Figure 4. As for the results,
Figure 4(b) and Figure 4(c) are operated by a ﬁxed window
size 7x7 in spatial domain. The reconstructed images are overly
smoothed and have artifacts around the object. On the other
hand, the combination of Wiener ﬁlter and SWT outperforms
DWT with soft thresholding and DWT along with Wiener ﬁlter,
as shown in Figure 4(d), 4(e) and 4(f). It is seen that the studied
method can efﬁciently reduce noise in the homogeneous area
and simultaneously preserve the edges feature thereby resulting
in a better reconstructed image in terms of visual perception.
Next, in order to evaluate performance of studied method
more extensively, the realistic noisy liver and kidney ultrasonic

images are also used. The original images and resulting images
of different speckle noise reduction techniques are shown in
Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively. The results demonstrate that
SWT along with Wiener ﬁlter outperforms other methods since
it can effectively reduce speckle noises and simultaneously
preserve edge features as well as important details of the
ultrasonic images.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this research, the main aim is to study and compare
the different methods of speckle noise suppression in ultra-
sonic images. The studied method uses SWT to transform a
logarithmic image and then applies an adaptive Wiener ﬁlter
in each detailed subband. The advantage of multi-resolution
analysis using SWT for speckle noise reduction is that it
can reduce noise while preserving the feature structure of
the reconstructed image. From the preliminary results, the
combination of the SWT and adaptive Wiener ﬁlter has bet-
ter quantitative and qualitative performances, compared with
existing methods. Future work, the use of different types of
mother wavelets and other types of wavelet transform, such
as Wavelet Packet Transform, will be investigated in order to
get the best result. Moreover, subjective assessment has to be
performed by ultrasonographers in order to visually ensure the
reconstructed image quality. Consequently, the best technique
could be developed and be implemented in hardware.
