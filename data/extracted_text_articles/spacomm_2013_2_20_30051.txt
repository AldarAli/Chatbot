Abstract—The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is a 
type of the wireless communication device for vehicles, defined as 
a safety assist system for enabling drivers to efficiently check and 
manage tires. In the TPMS communications, external electric and 
electronic devices may interfere with the exact data transmission. 
In this paper, we propose a hybrid TPMS beamformer based on 
a switching beamformer and minimum-variance distortionless–
response (MVDR) beamformer for selecting an efficient 
algorithm depending on circumstances in order to eliminate the 
interference and to transfer the accurate data to drivers. We also 
suggest an effective signal decision algorithm based on the signal-
to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) in order to ensure the 
transferred data reliability. The performance of the suggested 
hybrid TPMS beamformer and the effective signal decision 
algorithm is identified through a computer simulation example.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is a safety 
assist device for measuring tire temperature and pressure by 
means of a sensor in each tire of a vehicle, transmitting the 
measured data to the signal processing unit of the vehicle, and 
displaying them in the display unit to inform the driver about 
the tire state information in real time [1]. The TPMS employs 
various carrier frequencies such as 433.92 MHz in U.S.A and 
Europe, and 433.92 MHz and 447 MHz in Korea. 
Most of TPMSs currently employ the one-way wireless 
communication 
technique 
with 
low 
data 
transmission 
efficiency and decision reliability. In order to overcome this 
problem, we suggest a method for deciding the TPMS data 
reliability of high performance based on the bidirectional 
communications. 
An 
advantage 
of 
the 
bidirectional 
communications is that it may save the power of the battery in 
the sensor unit installed in each tire, because it transmits the 
data when only it is required. Also, since it contains Ack/Nack 
data which indicates the effectiveness of the transmitted data 
and E/N data which indicates the condition of a tire, it may 
efficiently improve the data reliability. Decision of data 
efficiency by the suggested algorithm is based on the measured 
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR).  
The TPMS employing various frequencies across the globe 
may experience the serious interference by high-power signals 
from external electric and electronic devices utilizing the 
similar frequencies. Researchers have studied switching 
beamformers 
[2] 
and 
minimum-variance 
distortionless-
response (MVDR) beamformers [3] in order to eliminate the 
aforementioned 
interference. 
Although 
the 
switching 
beamformer has low computational complexity, it has low 
interference elimination performance. Although the MVDR 
beamformer has high interference elimination performance, it 
has extremely high computational complexity due to the 
calculation of an auto-correlation matrix. In this paper, we 
propose a hybrid beamformer, which selects one out of the 
switching beamformer and the MVDR beamformer according 
to circumstances. Decision of selecting one out of two 
beamformers is based on the measured SINR. We consider a 
structure which has a layout of M  receiving antennas in a line 
in the center of a relevant vehicle to use the beamformer for the 
TPMS. In order to eliminate the interference from other tires 
and reduce the power consumption of the battery in a sensor 
unit installed in each tire, we employ the Gold code to each tire. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, 
we define the received signal model for TPMS and the 
interference signals in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). 
In Section III, we describe effective signal decision algorithms 
in signal processing unit and sensor unit, including flow-charts. 
The hybrid beamformer based on the switching and MVDR 
beamformer is proposed to effectively suppress interference 
signals from external devices in Section IV. Computer 
simulations are provided in Section V to demonstrate the 
performance of the proposed technique. Finally, conclusions 
and the future work are outlined in Section VI.

spacing to a quarter or one-eighth of the wavelength. In order 
to save the length of entire space for the antenna elements, we 
are studying to employ the rectangular or the circular antenna 
array structure in the center of a vehicle.

EFFECTIVE SIGNAL DECISION ALGORITHM 
In this section, we propose a TPMS effective signal 
decision algorithm based on the duplex TPMS data architecture 
[2].

duplex  TPMS wireless communication system (signal processing unit) 
A. Effective Signal Decision Algorithm in Signal Processing 
Unit 
A flow chart for the effective signal decision in the signal 
processing unit installed in a vehicle is shown in Fig. 2. The 
signal processing unit measures SINR of the received signal, 
compares the measured SINR with a threshold. If the measured 
SINR is greater than the critical value, it sends the Ack signal, 
which means that the transmitted signal is effective, to the 
sensor unit to request transmitting the main data. On the 
contrary, if the measured SINR is smaller than the critical value, 
it does not send any signal and the sensor unit recognizes Nack 
which means that the transmitted signal is not effective. In this 
case, the sensor unit requests retransmitting the reference data. 
After receiving the main data, the signal processing unit 
decides the normal or abnormal state of a tire using the main 
data. If the tire is decided normal, the signal processing unit 
transmits N bit (for example, bit 1) which indicates the normal 
mode, and operates in the normal mode which indicates the 
normal tire state (for example, receiving data once per minute). 
On the contrary, if the tire is decided abnormal, the signal 
processing unit transmits E signal (for example, bit -1) which 
indicates an emergency mode, and operates in the emergency 
mode which indicates a dangerous tire state (for example, 
receiving data once per second). The data processed in the 
signal processing unit is sent to the display unit to enable a 
driver to check the tire condition.

B. Effective Signal Decision Algorithm in Sensor Unit 
Fig. 3 shows a flow chart for the suggested effective signal 
decision method based on a duplex TPMS communication 
system in the sensor unit. The sensor unit receives Ack/Nack 
and E/N bits from the signal processing unit. If the sensor 
receives the Ack bit (for example, bit 1), it transmits main data 
to the signal processing unit. On the contrary, if the sensor unit 
receives Nack bit (for example, no bit), it retransmits reference 
data (preamble data) to the signal processing unit. If the signal 
transmitted from the main data is decided N bit (for example, 
bit 1), the sensor unit operates in the normal mode (for example, 
transmitting data once per minute). If it is decided E bit (for 
example, bit -1), the sensor unit operates in the emergency 
mode (for example, transmits data once per second).  
 
IV. 
HYBRID BEAMFORMER 
In order to efficiently suppress interference signals from 
external devices and receive the accurate data from the sensor 
unit, we propose a hybrid beamformer, which selectively uses 
the switching beamformer and MVDR beamformer after 
comparing the measured SINR and the given threshold. The 
switching beamfomer has obviously low computational 
complexity comparing with the MVDR beamformer, because it 
does not require an auto-correlation matrix but the MVDR 
beamfore requires that. Hybrid beamformer forms beam in a  
 
Figure 4.  Flow chart of the hybrid TPMS beamformer 
desired direction to receive TPMS data. The received signal 
includes TPMS signals of each tire, interference from external 
devices, and noise. The hybrid beamformer basically uses the 
switching beamformer to weaken interference signals. If the 
output SINR of the switching beamformer is greater than the 
threshold, the output signal of the switching beamformer is 
analyzed to display the data in the display unit and thus to 
inform a driver about the tire condition. However, if the 
measured SINR is smaller than the threshold, the hybrid 
beamformer changes the mode from the switching beamformer 
to the MVDR beamformer as shown in Fig. 4.  
Since 
the 
switching 
beamformer 
has 
very 
low 
computational complexity and has the relatively good 
performance of interference suppression, it is used as a basic 
beamformer of the hybrid beamformer. That is, if the measured 
SINR is greater than a specific threshold, the hybrid 
beamformer operates in the switching beamformer mode. 
However, if the SINR of the switching beamformer output is 
smaller than the threshold, it results the low ratio of the 
accurate data reception due to the interference signals. In this 
case, we employ the MVDR beamformer, which forms beam in 
the desired direction and nulls in the directions of the 
interference signals to minimize them, at the same time [7]. 
The MVDR beamformer has excellent performance of 
interference elimination, but it needs calculation of an auto- 
correlation matrix resulted in very high computational 
complexity. The proposed hybrid beamformer optimizes 
interference elimination performance and computational

despreaded using the unique Gold code for the i th tire.  
 
V. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION 
Computer simulation result is described below to identify 
the performance of SINR threshold decision for an effective 
data decision method and the hybrid beamforming technology. 
We use a million received signal data for determining the SINR 
threshold for the suggested effective data decision method and 
set the number of antennas as one. Fig. 6 shows data reliability 
from –10 dB to 10 dB with respect to SINR. From the figure, 
we observe that increasing SINR results in rising data 
reliability. This result is utilized to determine the threshold for 
the proposed hybrid beamformer. 
Six receiving antennas are used to identify the performance 
of the suggested hybrid TPMS interference suppression. It is 
based on the assumption that the received signal included three 
interference signals and noise, and a Gold code of 
N =15
 is 
given to the TPMS signal of each tire. The incident angles of 
transmitted signals for each tire are assumed 60°, 120°, 240°, 
and 300°, respectively. The incident angles for 3 interference 
signals are randomly assumed 89°, 175°, and 340°, respectively. 
It is identified that the output SINR threshold value, which is a 
reference of data reliability 99% is about 4.4 dB from Fig. 6. 
This value is assumed as a threshold in the simulation for 
evaluating hybrid beamformer performance.  
Fig. 7(a) and 7(b) show beampatterns for the switching 
beamformer which forms beams to direction of incidents 
angles 60° and 300° with respect to the right-front and right–
rear tire TMPS signals and which forms beams to direction of 
incident angles 120° and 240° with respect to the left-front and 
left–rear tire TMPS signals, respectively. Fig. 8(a) and 8(b)

beams for right and left tire TPMS signals, respectively. Note 
that the MVDR beamformer forms nulls to incident angles of 
interference signals, unlike the switching beamfomer. Since the 
array response vector includes the cosine function, the 
proposed hybrid beamformer alternately uses two weight 
vectors (not four weight vectors) for the front tire in the right

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Enactment for compulsory use of TPMS to inform a driver 
about the tire condition in real time is globally underway in 
order to prevent serious traffic accidents due to abnormal tires. 
Since the TPMS employs wireless communication technique, it 
is essential to ensure the data reliability. For the high TPMS 
data 
reliability, 
we 
considered 
the 
duplex 
wireless 
communication technique, which is more developed than the 
one-way wireless communication method used in the 
conventional TPMS, and suggested a data reliability decision 
method according to the threshold based on SINR of received 
signals. We also proposed a hybrid TPMS beamformer based 
on the switching beamformer and MVDR beamformer in order 
to effectively eliminate interference caused from external 
devices. An optimum algorithm between two beamformers is 
selected based on the measured SINR according to 
circumstances for exact data transmission. The unique Gold 
code is employed to each tire in order to eliminate interference 
signals from other tires and to reduce the power consumption 
of a battery in the sensor unit of TPMS. The performance of 
the proposed hybrid TPMS beamformer was illustrated via the 
computer simulation example. In the future work, we will 
consider the effects of the car body and the ground, and the 
coupling between antennas for TPMS.
