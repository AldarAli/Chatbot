    Abstract--Wind energy has recently became the most 
promising renewable energy. The global cumulative installed 
wind power capacity increased dramatically to reach 627GW 
in 2019.  In order to handle the growing size and more 
stringent grid codes, researchers have developed and improved 
many converters topologies. Some of these converters are 
commercialized while others are still in development. This 
paper presents the state-of-the-art of the power converters 
usable in wind turbine applications, an overview of the most 
interesting converters topologies and their efficiency in Wind 
Turbine Systems (WTS). As reliability became essential in 
WTS, especially in offshore turbines, a detailed study on the 
reliability of the static converters used in WTS with a 
comparison analyse of the most reliable configurations and 
their fault tolerant ability. The study shows the importance of 
the choice of the power converter topology in the overall 
reliability of WTS.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Unlike the fossil fuel energy, with renewable energies, it 
is possible to produce electricity without harming the 
environment. In the last decade, with global awareness of 
climate warming, electricity production from the energy 
renewable has come under increasing attention. In 2019, the 
power production from renewables energies has reached 
2530GW, it is about a third of total installed electricity 
capacity. Wind power is the second most renewable energies 
installed in the word with 627GW which represents 21% of 
global energy renewable electricity production [1]. 
The used technology in wind turbine applications has 
changed since the power capacity penetration has grown 
dramatically to reach, for example, 14% of all electric energy 
consumption in Europe and 41% of all electric energy 
consumption in Denmark [2]. The first configuration used in 
wind turbine applications was a fixed-speed Squirrel-Cage 
induction Generator (SCIGs) directly connected to the grid.  
Recently, as the power capacity of the wind turbines 
increases, regulating the frequency and the voltage in the 
grid becomes a very important issue, the technology has 
developed toward variable speed. Permanent Magnet 
Synchronous Generator (PMSG) connected to the grid 
through a power converter shows nice properties like high 
efficiency, small size, and low maintenance; hence, it is a 
nice choice for wind turbine applications.   
The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of recent 
converters technologies used in WTS. On other hand, as 
reliability is a major challenge in WTS, a comparative study 
about reliability of those converters is presented.  
In section II, an overview of existing technology market 
developments of wind power generation. In section III, the 
most used wind turbine configurations and currents 
promising power converters topologies for WTS are 
presented. In section IV, the reliability of WTS components 
is analyzed. In section V, as they constitute one of major 
source of failure, a study about reliability of power 
converters used in WTS is presented. Finally, the 
conclusions are presented in section VI. 
II. 
WIND TURBINE SYSTEMS  
The wind power installed capacity is growing 
significantly since 1999 to reach 58 GW installed only in 
2019. Therefore, the cumulative installed wind power 
capacity increased exponentially from 6100 MW in 1996 to 
627 GW in 2019. Estimation predicts that this number would 
reach 2015 GW in 2030. Approximately 10 countries have 
more than 83% of all cumulative installed wind power 
capacity in the world, including 5 countries in Europe 
(Germany, Spain, UK, France, Italy), 2 in the Asia-Pacific  
(China, India), 2 in North America (US, Canada) and 1 in 
Latin America (Brazil), [1]. This dominance is shown in 
Figure 1 and it’s obvious that countries with high technology 
advancements have a higher growth rate and higher 
penetration of wind power electricity. The large turbine 
presents a lot of advantages. They allow capturing a high 
power with low installation and maintenance costs compared 
to the small turbines. Hence, the size of the commercial wind 
turbine has greatly increased in the last decade as presented 
in Figure 2. The largest wind turbine reported in 2020 is 
12MW with a diameter of 220 m (General Electric Haliade-
X 12MW), and it is will be commissioned in 2021.

Siemens Gamesa has announced that they are developing 14 
MW wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 222 m. It 
announced that the turbine will be available in 2024 [3].  
Denmark based wind turbine company Vestas remained the 
world’s largest wind turbine manufacturer and supplier in 
2018 [4], due to its wide geographic diversification strategy 
and strong performance in the U.S. market.

companies account for over 75% of the global installed 
capacity every year, and their industrial dominance is 
expected to continue over the future.  
III. 
 WIND TURBINE CONCEPTS AND CONVERTERS 
TOPOLOGIES 
Depending on the types of generator, power converters 
and speed control, most wind turbine can be classified into 
following four types: 
 
Type 1: Fixed-speed wind turbine systems; 
 
Type 2: Semi-variable   speed   wind    turbine     
with variable rotor resistance; 
 
Type 3: Variable speed wind turbine with partial-
scale converter; 
 
Type 4: Variable speed wind turbine with a full-scale 
converter. 
All those wind turbine technologies have been used and 
commercialized in the last 30 years. Due to their efficiency 
the two last configurations are the most dominant 
technologies in the market. The power converters is one of 
the most important components of Wind Turbine System 
(WTS). The main objective of the power converters is to 
ensure the generator speed variation control in the turbine 
system. To accomplish this purpose, different topologies of 
converter have been proposed in the literature in the last 
decades. Recently, with the growing wind turbine 
penetration, these converters have to fulfil several technical 
requirements.  The converter cost is an important factor, 
since it represents approximately 7%~8% of the global cost 
of the wind turbine system [8][9]. The cost of maintenance 
must also be as low as possible to reach less expensive and 
competitive energy compared with the others sources of 
energy, reliability is also an important element in the choice 
of the converters. The efficiency of the converters is also 
very important, especially in high power wind turbines 
where even, 1% efficiency improvement can save thousands 
of dollars over a period of a few years [19]. The output 
power quality of the converters is a primordial in the 
comparison between the different topologies. The output 
voltage should be as close as possible to the sinusoidal 
shape with low total harmonic distortion (THD) and small 
filter for a better converter [12][17]. The power converters 
can be classified as direct and indirect according to the 
different stages of the conversion. Overall, the indirect 
Back-to-Back (BTB) converters technology is the most used 
in the wind turbine applications [10]. 
A.  Two-levels Voltage Source Converter (2L-VSC) 
The two-levels voltage source converters are the most 
widely used converters on the market. For its simple, 
configuration this technology is mastered and well 
established in the field of wind energy conversion. It is 
considered a dominant topology used in around 90% of the 
wind turbines with power less than 0.75 MW. As illustrated 
in Figure 4, the Voltage Source Rectifier (VSR) and the 
Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) are back-to-back and are 
connected to a dc-link capacitor. This dc-link ensures the 
decoupling between the generator and the grid, therefore 
transient in the generator do not appear on the grid side. The 
VSR controls the torque and speed of the generator, while 
the VSI controls the voltage of the dc-link and the reactive 
power of the grid.

The VSR and the VSI are generally made with low-voltage 
transistors (LV-IGBT) arranged in a matrix. The switching 
frequency of VSR and VSI are fixed between 1 and 3 kHz to 
achieve low witching loss and high power density [5]. 
 
Figure 4.  BTB based on the two-levels voltage source converter. 
B. Parallel two-levels Voltage Source Converter (2L-VSC) 
To achieve high current capacity, two or more VSC 
converters can be connected in parallel depending on the 
power required. As illustrated in Figure 5, two VSC modules 
are connected in parallel to reach a power of 1.5 MW 
corresponding to type 4 of the wind turbines. For type 3 of 
the wind turbines, connecting two modules in parallel can 
achieve a power of 5 MW. This configuration allows a wide 
margin for redundancy operation. To improve the system 
efficiency in the case of under production one or more 
converter modules can be put out of service. The redundancy 
of the converters allows to the wind turbine to continue 
operating at reduced capacity in the case of a fault in the 
converters, after the faulty module is isolated. In the Gamesa 
G128, more than 6 power converters are connected in 
parallel to reach a nominal power of 4.5 MW [11]. However, 
the major disadvantage is that a large number of modules 
lead to the complexity control and congestion of the system.  
Figure 5.  WTS with parallel connected BTB Two-levels VSCs  
C. Three-levels Neutral-Point Clamped Converter (3L-
NPC) 
Another solution that has been widely studied in the 
literature for type 4 of the wind turbines is the three-levels 
Neutral 
Point 
Clamped 
converter 
(NPC). 
In 
this 
configuration, an arrangement of four power switches per 
leg, clamped with diodes to a midpoint of the dc-link. With 
this configuration, each power device has to block only half 
of the total converter voltage then the power of the converter 
can be doubled [13].  The output phase voltage of the 
converter contains three-levels leading to a reduced voltage 
variations dv/dt and electromagnetic interference compared 
to the 2L-VSC converters [12][13][16][20]. The main 
drawback of 3L-NPC is that the power switches do not have 
symmetric losses, forcing a derating of the devices. As 
shown in Figure 6, NPC converters enable medium voltage 
operation, and commercial wind turbines reached 6 MW 
rated power without connecting serial or parallel switching 
devices. These converters are installed and marketed with the 
“Multibrid M5000” wind turbine [6][22]. 
 
 
Figure 6.   Three-levels Neutral-Point Clamped Converter ( 3L-NPC) . 
 
D. Three-levels Active Neutral-Point Clamped Converter   
(3L-ANPC) 
The     Active  Neutral  Point  Clamp (ANPC)     
converters,  illustrated in figure 7,  have a structure almost 
identical to the NPC converters, the diodes are replaced by  
Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) switches. Although 
more active switches are used, that allowing more 
redundancy to maintain the frequency and the same 
switching losses in all the IGBT switches, [6][12][23][24]. In 
similar operations, BTB 3L-ANPC converters are capable of 
handling 32% higher power (up to 7.12 MW) and 57% 
higher switching frequency (1650 Hz) compared to 3L-NPC 
BTB converters.  This configuration has been applied more 
recently in the field of MV drives and can also be used in the 
wind turbine system sector [18]. Vestas, one of the leading 
manufacturers, is currently studying this power converter 
topology, [19].

ANPC). 
E. Three-levels Flying Capacitor  Converter (3L-FC) 
The configuration of the Flying Capacitor converter (FC) 
is similar to the NPC converter, where the clamping diodes 
14

are replaced by the floating capacitors. The concept of FC 
was introduced in the early 1970, and was introduced into 
machines drives applications in the 1990. The converter 
generates additional voltage levels while reducing voltage 
stress on the drive [14]. The power switches, setting an FC 
between two devices, is illustrated in Figure 8. Each pair of 
switches with an FC constitutes a power cell.  
 
 
Figure 8.  Three-levels Flying Capacitor Converter (3L-FC)  
The most important difference with the NPC topology is that 
the FC has a modular structure and additional cells can be 
connected, increasing the number of voltage levels of the 
converter and the power rate. 
The advantages of the flying capacitor multilevel 
converter are flexible switch mode, high protection ability to 
power devices, to control active power and reactive power 
conveniently [25][26]. The 3-levels configuration has found 
a practical application, but has not yet found a commercial 
success in wind turbines.  
IV. 
WIND TURBINE SYSTEM RELIABILITY  
Recently, 
with 
the 
orientation 
of 
wind 
energy 
manufacturers towards offshore wind turbines, the issue of 
the reliability of wind systems has become a major 
preoccupation for what it generates maintenance costs 
caused by accessibility limited of wind farms. This problem 
has been extensively studied in literature to identify a major 
failure in wind systems. Researchers have conducted surveys 
of the reliability of wind systems at various wind sites 
around the world to identify the most common faults in these 
systems [27-31]. According to a study published by the 
University of Kassel, Germany in 2006 [27], based on the 
recovery of maintenance data from a 13 years (1993-2006) 
on a wind power site Germany, the power converters is a 
leading cause of failure in wind system as shown in Figure 9. 
Another study [28], shows that the use of maintenance data 
recorded for 11 years in a field of 650 wind turbines in 
Germany allowed researchers to identify the main causes of 
failures on this site. The conclusions given in [28] show that 
the defects in the converters represent a large part of these 
defects.  They are ranked in 3rd position just behind the faults 
in the electrical system control and the mechanical defects in 
the rotor. 
More recently, in 2016, a study of the City University of 
Hong Kong on two wind farms in China [29], the researchers 
found different results: -The first project, which contains 61 
wind turbines of 1.5 MW, with data recovered over a period 
of 4 years between 2009 and 2013, the result shows that 
electrical systems (converters) account for 14% of the 
failures. The control of the wind system accounts for the 
largest share of these defects with 35% of total defects 
recorded over this period. The second project contains a 
small number of wind turbines, 46 wind turbines, but with a 
power greater than that of the first project, 2 MW by a wind 
turbine. The analysis of maintenance data over a period of 
two years show that electrical systems (converters) account 
for 26% of failures, equal to failures rate found in the control 
system. 
 
 
Figure 9.  Share of main components of total number of failures [27]. 
   The wind turbines designed in 2000 are generally based on 
fixed or semi-variable speed technology, different from the 
technology generally used this last decade based on the 
synchronous machine with variable speed. It can be noted 
that the zone of the installation of these fields also plays an 
important role in the rates of defects of the components. 
Another point that can be made is that the reliability of wind 
turbines systems depends on the reliability of the used 
components and experience of the manufacturers. However, 
despite the difference in the failure rates between the 
different components of the wind system, which can be 
found in the different studies, the defects in the converters 
are considered as a major element in the shut-down of the 
service in the almost all of these studies. 
V. 
CONVERTERS RELIABILITY IN WIND TURBINES 
APPLICATIONS  
In the following, a deep analysis of the different 
reliability studies carried out on wind turbines around the 
world is proposed. The purpose of this analysis is to find a 
link between the different systems used in wind turbines and 
the failure rate in power converters. This study will allow us 
to identify the causes of failures in power converters and to 
propose the solutions and topologies to be used to improve 
the reliability of wind turbine systems. In [28] and [30], the 
results of the data recovered on the wind farms, affirm that, 
contrary to that is widespread in the literature, the failures in 
the systems with direct drive permanent magnet synchronous 
generator (PMSG) are more significant to those with indirect 
drive doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). In their 
conclusions, the authors ask questions about the usefulness 
of the systems based on PMSG generators with the number 
of failures recorded, while it is supposed to improve the 
reliability of wind turbines systems. In the same study of  the 
15

University of Columbia [30], the failure rates in the electrical 
converters used in the case of the two systems (Geared/ 
Direct drive) are studied and compared. The failures at the 
converters are greater in the case where the system is based 
on direct drive technology. In another study [31], 
maintenance data from 2220 turbines were studied to 
determine the failure rate in the various components of these 
systems. The wind turbines studied are modern types, with 
power ranging between 1.5 MW to 2 MW. They are divided 
into two groups, depending on the training configuration. 
The first group is made up of 1800 turbines based on the 
DFIG generators. The second group consists of 400 turbines 
equipped with the PMSG generators. It should be noted that 
the converters used in the two configurations belong to the 
same manufacturer, which will allow us to analyse and 
compare the failures of these converters for each 
configuration. The comparison between the failure rates of 
the power converters of the two systems illustrated in 
Figure10 shows that the converter in the direct drive system 
with PMSG generators presents annual failure rate of 0.593 
which is approximately four times more than the failure rates  
recorded in the system based on the DFIG generators. 
To answer the questions on the number of significant failures 
recorded in PMSG generators systems compared to systems 
based on the DFIG generators, asked by the authors in, 
[28][30]. 
 
Figure 10.  Annual failure rate [31]. 
This difference is mainly due to the increase in failures in 
power converters. Knowing that for the same power value 
of a turbine, the used converter in the PMSG systems must 
have a power three times higher than that of the converter 
used in DFIG systems, since in the latter case, the power 
supplied via the converter represents only part of the overall 
power supplied by the turbine. Since the maximum power of 
a two-levels converter does not exceed 750 kW, to increase 
the powers in PMSG systems, manufacturers tend to put in

parallel several two-levels converters as presented in Figure 
5, which generates the increase of the number of switches 
and proportionally the number of failures in the system. 
Figure 11 illustrates a comparison between the failures of 
converters recorded in two studies [30][31] with turbines of 
different powers. It is noted that the increase in the power of 
the turbine generates the increase in the difference between 
failure rates between the DFIG systems and the PMSG 
systems, due to the paralleling of two-levels converters to 
achieve the desired power. 
In the literature, the reliability of the power converters is 
linked only to the redundancy of the system, something 
which could be sufficient in the case of onshore wind 
turbines. Furthermore, in offshore wind turbines where for 
economic 
and 
production 
reasons, 
the 
reliability 
requirement is more important any source of failure must be 
considered. 
Figure 11.  Converters failures rates based on the power of the turbine. 
Therefore, in this study the analysis of several maintenance 
data from   different   wind   farms around the world, 
allowed us to identify the importance and the need to take 
into account the number of switches used in the converters 
as a criterion for the reliability of energy conversation 
systems. Moreover, the choice of the most reliable converter 
topology is depending on the power of the application. In 
Table I, an example of  reliability of converters for a 5 MW 
wind turbine, in this case the paralleling of 2-level 
converters do not offer higher reliability since the number of 
switches which are fragile components becomes very 
important and decrease the reliability of the whole system. 
Multilevel converters, especially modified 3-level NPC 
converter with redundant arm [32][33][34] can be the most 
suitable for this application, as they present redundancy and 
low number of switches. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The global production capacity of wind turbines has been 
steadily increasing over the past ten years, and as a result the 
penetration rate has risen dramatically, which imposes more 
requirements and constraints on the design of the wind 
turbines systems. This paper gives a summary of the latest 
technologies and industrial solutions used in the field of 
wind turbines. The paper shows the importance of power 
converters in the performance and efficiency of the wind 
turbines systems. Several topologies of converters are 
studied in the literature. However, only a few topologies are 
used today in the real industry applications. The choice of 
the converters is important in the global wind turbines 
systems. The two-levels converters are most used but with 
the current trend towards systems with high power levels and 
high voltage levels, multilevel converters, especially three-
levels NPC converters represent the most suitable system. 
For reliability of the power converters issues, the failures at 
the level of converters are proportional to the number of 
switches used in the energy conversion system. The majority 
of recent studies claim that, contrary to popular belief, 
failures in systems based on PMSG generators are greater 
than those in systems based on the DFIG generators. In our 
study, we explain the reasons which are mainly due to the 
significant increase in failures in the power converters 
system. However, systems based on the PMSG generators 
remain the most reliable for onshore wind turbines since the 
downtime caused by a failure at the converters is 
significantly lower than that caused by a failure of the 
gearbox.
