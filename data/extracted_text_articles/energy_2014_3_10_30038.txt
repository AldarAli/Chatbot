Abstract—Understanding 
the 
energy 
consumption 
of 
households is a cornerstone for improving residential energy 
efficiency. In addition, the CO2 emission profile of energy 
consumption must be fully understood, to achieve the 
decarbonisation of energy sector in Europe. Smart houses 
incorporated into smart grids allow the survey and control of 
household energy consumption. In this article, the electricity 
consumption and its related CO2 emissions are studied for a 
typical Finnish household. A model detached house is used to 
simulate the effect of home automation, designed to optimize 
energy usage, on the CO2 emissions of this household. Hourly 
electricity production data are used with an hourly electricity 
consumption profile generated using fuzzy logic. CO2 emissions 
were obtained from the monthly and weekly electricity 
generated data. The CO2 emissions related to the use of electric 
appliances represent around 543 kgCO2/y per dwelling when 
considering the electricity generated only, and 335 kgCO2/y 
when balancing the emissions with the exported and imported 
electricity. Home automation reduced the CO2 emissions by 13 %. 
Part of emission reduction was achieved through peak shifting, 
by moving energy consumption load from daytime to night 
time. This paper aims at highlighting the role of home 
automation in reducing CO2 emissions of the residential sector 
in the context of smart grid development.

 INTRODUCTION 
In December 2013, the European Commission has set 
clear 
goals 
in 
its 
Energy 
Roadmap 
2050 
(COM(2011)885/2), to achieve a decarbonised society. 
Decarbonisation in this context means reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions to 80 % - 95 % below 1990 levels by 2050. 
This will provide considerable challenges for electricity 
production, consumption and management. Smart grids 
represent one tool for achieving this target. Smart grids aim 
at increasing the energy efficiency of the network, peak load 
shaving, 
load 
shifting, 
and 
reduction 
of 
energy 
consumption. Smart buildings are expected to be an integral 
part of smart grids, with smart meters as the gateway 
allowing the entrance of smartness into the building. Smart 
meters receive and send information to and from the 
building for use such as in Home Area Networks, and Grid 
handling. 
The massive deployment of smart meters under way in 
Europe facilitates digital measurements, and will allow a 
consequent access to energy consumption data to energy 
companies and authorities. European Union (EU) Member 
States have the obligation of implementing smart meters 
covering 80 % of consumers by 2020 at the latest [1]. In 
contrast to the European Energy Efficiency Directive 
(2012/27/EU) [1], the Finnish Electricity Market law 
588/2013 and its application Act 2009/66 on the electricity 
supply in the survey and measurement sets the deadline of 
2014 [2]. Legal obligations to increase energy efficiency 
also provide a motivation to the deployment of renewable 
energy sources (RES) as a vector for energy production, 
both electrical and heating, in a large scale as well as in the 
buildings. Home energy management can have a significant 
role in contributing to energy efficiency and cutting or 
shifting peak load. This can be achieved through an active 
collaboration of energy consuming systems and the 
information network on a local level [3]. Putting together 
the different factors, smart grids, smart building, RES-based 
heat and electricity and energy efficiency, involve the 
development of a smart energy network (SEN), capable of 
managing the energy system through constant monitoring. 
The impact of energy efficiency on emissions from the 
residential sector has been a subject of much research [4]. It 
has been shown that electric load shifting from the 
residential sector may reduce air pollution in urban areas 
[5]. To this effect, developing mathematical tools that are 
able to anticipate and cut emissions through the deployment 
of smart systems and home automation is of major 
importance. 
This article aims at exploring the significance of home 
automation and its impact on the carbon emissions of 
dwelling, and the possible ways home automation can 
contribute to decarbonisation. In the first section of the 
paper, a description of the CO2 emissions from the 
production and the use of electricity in Finland will be 
presented. The second section presents the methodology 
used for translating hourly carbon emissions to single 
households will be described. The third section shows and 
details the results from the simulations carried out on two 
chosen type of dwelling which will be described and 
analysed.

RELATED RESEARCHES 
Researches on smart houses and their development have 
been going on for quite some times. Smart homes can be 
broadly seen as a building monitored and controlled for 
multiple purposes [6]. The energy management feature 
taken in charge by the smart home is one aspect that has

been developed. Algorithms for generating electricity 
consumption load profile have been developed on an hourly 
and half-hourly basis [7], but also with a finer grid on a 
minute-basis [8]. These algorithms can be further used to 
emphasise the potential of energy smart houses and their 
roles in improving the energy efficiency, reducing the 
energy consumption, and reducing the carbon emissions 
from the energy used. More elaborated algorithms have 
been developed where the integration of each appliance 
within the dwelling have been modelled [9], [10].  Finally, 
the management of appliances within the dwelling may as 
well be implemented in simulation for optimizing their 
usage and enhancing demand-side management [11], [12]. 
Previous studies have attempted to measure the impact of 
energy efficiency measures on the CO2 emissions from the 
residential sector [4]. Detailed algorithms for evaluating the 
CO2 emissions from appliances usage have been proposed 
[13]. One of the main drawbacks of the previous methods is 
that the carbon emissions are based on a fixed coefficient, 
thus limiting the understanding of the CO2 emissions 
mechanism. A more dynamic model has been elaborated for 
estimating the CO2 emissions and their impact on demand 
response [14]. Although the last research has based its 
dynamism on real dataset of energy production on an hourly 
basis for various countries, the CO2 emissions related to the 
production of electricity is based on the IEA annual report 
on CO2 emissions [15]. Consequently, studies on segmented 
electricity production, related CO2 emissions, and the 
impact of home automation on the emissions are lacking. 
III. 
ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION AND CARBON EMISSIONS 
IN FINLAND 
The role of the residential sector in reducing carbon 
emissions is paramount in the development of the future 
smart grid [16]. In terms of CO2 emission reduction in the 
residential sector, the largest effort should be made in 
retrofitting buildings.  The average renewal time of the 
residential sector is estimated to be around 70 years [4]. The 
influence of technology on CO2 emissions needs to be 
highlighted.  Consequently, technology upgrading can 
greatly influence the total CO2 emissions of the residential 
sector. In Finland, lighting consumes over 30 % of the total 
electricity used in households for appliances [17]. The 
upgrade of lighting technology is one way for impacting 
energy consumption [9], but also for reducing carbon 
emissions [18].  Furthermore, home energy management 
systems will continue to play a role for increasing energy 
efficiency, reducing energy consumption [19] and allow 
load shifting.  
Electricity 
generation 
and 
consumption 
is 
being 
constantly surveyed, recorded and reported by the Official 
Statistics of Finland. In 2012, household appliances 
consumed 8 072 GWh of electricity [17]. At the same time,  
2 579 781 households were registered in Finland [20], 
resulting in an average consumption of 3 129 kWh/y.dw-1. 
There can be considerable deviation from this average value, 
if the households is in an apartment building or a detached 
house [21]. Furthermore, the total electricity production in 
Finland was around 67.7 TWh in 2012, while the total 
consumption of electricity was around 82.9 TWh, and a total 
of 8.4 MtCO2 were emitted. Therefore, it can be estimated 
that the share of electricity using devices in the total CO2 
emissions from electricity production and use are 1001 
tCO2/GWhpro or 817 tCO2/GWhcons.  
IV. 
METHODOLOGY 
A. Electricity consumption profile 
The house electricity demand profile is drawn on an 
hourly basis using different components for evaluating the 
electricity consumption from appliances, without primary 
and secondary electric heating systems. Two dwellings will 
be studied: one having home automation and one without 
home automation and the difference in their CO2 balance 
will be evaluated. 
The modelled house contains twenty-one appliances, all 
of them labelled A or B [9]. The house being in Finland, one 
of the appliances is an electric sauna stove. The sauna stove 
used for the modelled house was set to be 6 kW. The overall 
electricity consumption of appliances in this modelled house 
is 4 501 kWh/y, which correlates with the findings of the 
European ODYSSEE MURE project and that of the 
Sähkötohtori Analysis [21]. The measured data were 
obtained from detached houses in Oulu, Finland, which were 
equipped with a 10 kW sauna stove. 
B. Hourly electricity generation and emissions 
 Data acquisition consisted of analysing the electricity 
generation of all power plants in Finland and the categories 
of power plants on an hourly basis. Secondly, the carbon 
dioxide emissions associated with the aforementioned 
categories were calculated on an hourly basis. Monthly CO2 
emissions are available from July 2007 to October 2013 
[22]. It is then possible to evaluate the CO2 emissions on an 
hourly basis by associating both elements, the primary 
energy source for electricity generation and the associated 
monthly CO2 emissions. 
The electricity generated in Finland on an hourly basis is 
reported by the Finnish Transmission Service Operator – 
Fingrid since 2004 [23]. The data is split into two groups: the 
electricity generated from the power plants and the electrical 
load on the network taking into consideration the import and 
export of electricity. Moreover, the Finnish Industry 
Association 
(Energiateollisuus) 
recorded 
the 
weekly 
electricity generated from 1990 [24], which has been broken 
down between the energy technology used for producing the 
electricity: wind, hydropower, nuclear, CHP Industry, CHP 
district heating, conventional and gas turbine power plant. 
Finally, Fingrid informs in real-time the state of the network 
using the same categories as mentioned above. Thus, for 
building up the hourly electricity generation by categories for 
the year 2012, the weekly average electricity production by 
category is used in parallel with the hourly electricity 
generated 
countrywide. 
The 
exported 
electricity 
is

considered in the electricity generated and in the 
corresponding CO2 emissions. The imported electricity is 
considered as a share of the CO2 emissions from electricity 
consumption in Finland. In order to include the imported 
electricity into the overall emissions from electricity 
consumption in Finland, it is necessary to know the energy 
mix for producing the electricity of the country from which 
Finland is importing. The hourly electricity generated from a 
particular energy source in the primary country is evaluated 
using (1). The notation h, w, and m designate the hourly, 
weekly, and monthly time step respectively, i is the energy 
technology used for producing the electricity, and tot stands 
for the total amount of a unit countrywide.  
 
(1) 
Where Ph,i is the electric energy generated by a given 
technology per hour [MWh/h], Pw,i is the electric energy 
generated on a weekly basis by a given technology 
[MWh/w], Pw,tot is the total amount of electricity produced 
in Finland per week [MWh/w], and Ph,tot is the total amount 
of electricity produced per hour [MWh/h]. 
Once the hourly electricity generated by technology has 
been defined, it is possible to evaluate the hourly emissions 
from the power plant park. 
C. The CO2 emissions from power plants  
As part of the its legal obligation, Finland is publishing 
the CO2 emissions from power plants, and every energy 
intensive industry reports its expected and measured CO2 
emissions for each site [25]. The Finnish Industry 
Association estimates monthly specific emissions related to 
electricity production, based on the type of fuel used by the 
energy industry [24]. By knowing the hourly electricity 
production from each sector, it results in estimating the CO2 
emissions for each hour countrywide using (2) to (5).  
 
(2) 
Where, a is evaluated using (3) if the full week is within 
the same month n, or (4) if the full week is between two 
months, n and n+1. 
 
(3) 
 
 
(4) 
Thus, the hourly emission is given by, 
 
(5) 
Where Eh,i-gen is the total emissions from the electricity 
generated hourly [ktCO2/h], and Ew,tot is the total weekly 
emissions for all power plants [ktCO2/m], δw is the day 
number within a week where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7, 
δm is the number of days in the studied month, Em,n is the 
monthly CO2 emissions for the month n. Fig. 1 (a) illustrates 
the energy generated and its corresponding CO2 emissions 
on an hourly basis for the year 2012 in Finland. It can be 
noticed that, although there is a strong correlation of CO2 
emissions to electricity generation, emissions may decrease 
even though the energy generation increases, due to the fact 
the energy mix is changing Fig. 1 (b). 
The emissions due to the electricity imported are further 
implemented to the primary emissions from the electricity 
generated within the country. The CO2 emissions from the 
electricity generated dedicated to the export is further 
subtracted from the hourly emissions Eh,c1. In order to 
account the total CO2 emissions from the electricity load in 
the country, the emissions from each country with which 
Finland is trading electricity are evaluated, meaning 
Norway, Sweden, Russia and Estonia. As the hourly energy 
mix is not known for each country, a general coefficient of 
CO2 emissions has been considered for each country named

previously, respectively 30, 17, 384 and 1 014 kgCO2/MWhpro 
[15]. 
 The share of CO2 emissions coming from each trading 
country is evaluated using (6). 
 
(6) 
Where, Eh,cn is the hourly emissions for each participating 
country to the electricity trade [kgCO2/h], Ph,load is the 
hourly electric load on the Finnish network [MWh/h], Ph,net-cn 
is the net balance of electricity traded between Finland and 
the country n [MWh/h] in case of export or the difference 
between the electricity generated and the electricity 
exported in the case of Finland, and Ecn is the coefficient of 
CO2 
emissions 
for 
the 
corresponding 
country 
[kgCO2/MWh]. In case Ph,net-cn is negative, the coefficient of 
CO2 emissions is equal to Eh,i-gen as the emissions from the 
Finnish production is exported as well, otherwise, Ecn takes 
the value defined by the IEA. 
Finally the hourly emissions Eh are determined as the 
sum of the hourly emissions for each participating country 
to the electricity trade Eh,cn as shown in (7). 
 
(7) 
The emission data in Fig. 1 are then translated to a single 
household where the hourly electricity consumption profile 
has been previously generated using (8). 
 
(8) 
Where Eh,house is the hourly emissions from the household 
[kgCO2/h], and Pj,house is the total hourly electricity consumed 
by the household excluding the electric heating [kWh/h]. 
Two cases are differentiated: CO2 levels towards the 
production of electricity within the primary country, the net 
CO2 emissions level considering the import and export as 
presented in this section. In the first case, P takes the value 
of the total electricity produced in the primary country Ph,tot. 
In the second case, P takes the value of the total load on the 
electric grid of the primary country Ph,load.  
The results give an estimate of CO2 emissions related to 
the electricity consumption in a private household on an 
hourly basis. This model is then applied to the previously 
modelled dwelling in order to estimate the daily CO2 
emissions from an average Finnish dwelling. 
V. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The model showed that the CO2 emissions are highly 
dependent on electric consumption levels. Depending on the 
energy mix for electricity production at a given time, CO2 
emission levels may be lower at peak hours and thus not 
proportional to consumption levels. Two models have been 
developed. In the first case, the CO2 emissions from the 
dwelling are accounted relatively to the electricity 
production only. In the second case, the CO2 emissions from 
the dwelling are balanced with the electricity exported and 
imported. Fig. 3 represents the energy consumption for the 
two modelled dwellings with home automation (Fig. 3 (a)), 
and without home automation (Fig. 3 (b)). The electricity 
consumption shown was extracted for a randomly selected 
week in May 2012, starting on Monday, the 23rd of May.  
A. Case 1: Emissions related to the electricity production 
These dwellings are similar in their characteristics e.g. 
number and types of appliances, number of inhabitants, 
dwellings dimensions, or users’ habits. The CO2 emission 
levels vary from 0.06 to 0.20 kgCO2.kWh-1. The levels 
depend on the energy mix of Finland’s electricity generation. 
Consequently, the emissions from the dwelling, on an hourly 
basis, peak at 1.93 kgCO2.h-1 for the dwelling without home 
automation and 1.81 kgCO2.h-1 for the dwelling with home 
automation. In the first peak emission case, the related 
energy demand was 10.03 kWh.h-1 and, in the second peak 
emission case, 9.42 kWh.h-1. The maximum electricity 
consumption in the first case is 12.33 kWh.h-1, and 10.16 
kWh.h-1. The emission peaks are somewhat related to the 
level of electricity consumption but also to the energy mix 
for electricity generation at the same time. The use of home 
automation may reduce the instantaneous peak of CO2 
emissions. The daily electricity profile of the dwellings and 
CO2 balance between the two dwellings are represented in 
Fig. 3 (c). 
The difference in the profile of the two modelled 
dwellings result in a 592 kWh.y-1 reduction of total 
electricity consumption. In terms of CO2 emissions, the 
dwelling that is not equipped with a home automation emits 
543 kgCO2.y-1, while the house with home automation emit 
473 kgCO2.y-1. The amount of CO2 saved represents 12.78 % 
of original emissions. 
The home automation shifted some of the electricity 
consumption from the evening peak to the night. It resulted 
in a decrease of the CO2 emissions in the evening down to 37 % 
from the original level, and an increase of 51 % of CO2 
emissions overnight (Fig 3. (d)). Considering, however, that 
the emissions overnight are about 0.1 kgCO2.h-1 on average,

this can be regarded as relatively small cumulative amount. 
The emissions increased overnight by 3 to 5 kgCO2, and 
reduced by 17 kgCO2 on average over the whole year during 
the evening.  
While the home automation was not optimised for 
reducing CO2 emissions but for cutting the building peak 
load consumption, it resulted in the decrease of CO2 
emissions that relates to the electricity consumption. 
Notwithstanding, it is to be seen that the emissions related to 
electricity generation countrywide vary throughout the day. 
Fig. 2 represents the summed CO2 emissions per hour on the 
left axis and the hourly average profile of CO2 emissions on 
the right axis for the year 2012 from the electricity produced 
in Finland. 
The CO2 emissions during the peak hours are 0.95 
ktCO2.h-1 on average, and correspond to a total of 346 ktCO2 
between 6 and 7 pm. The lowest point on the daily plot of 
CO2 emissions occurs around 2 and 3 am, with an average 
emission of 0.8 ktCO2.h-1 and a corresponding emission for 
this particular hour throughout the year of 294 ktCO2. 
B. Case 2: Emissions related to the net load 
The CO2 emissions in this 2nd case were found much 
lower than in the first case. Firstly, the total CO2 emissions 
factor Eh,i-gen has slightly decreased. This can be interpreted 
as an improvement in the global CO2 emissions from the 
electric load at the country level. This is explained by the 
fact that Finland is mostly importing its electricity from 
Sweden and in second place from Russia. Norway and 
Estonia represents a small share of the electricity trade. On 
the one hand, Sweden has an average emission factor 
around 7 times smaller than the one of Finland, and on the 
other hand, Finland is exporting electricity with a high 
emission factor. Also, as the emissions from the Finnish 
electricity has been calculated for every hour, it introduce 
some peaks of CO2 emissions while the electricity from the 
surrounding countries are applied a constant factor, thus 
bring a bias result. Nevertheless, the exchange of electricity 
is beneficial for Finland in terms of CO2 emissions. The 
same dwellings that the one mentioned in case 1 were found 
to have 335 kgCO2.y-1 in case the home automation was not 
simulated, and 293 kgCO2.y-1 when home automation was 
running.  For both dwellings, the difference between case 1 
and 2 is around 38 %. This shows that the CO2 emissions 
can be interpreted very differently depending on whether the

produced electricity, dedicated to the export, is subtracted 
from the overall electricity consumption of the country or if 
it should be included into the total CO2 emissions. 
Similarly, the peak of CO2 emissions due to the 
electricity consumption in the dwellings are reduced 
compared to the Case 1 by 24 %. In the Case 2, the peak of 
CO2 emissions for the dwelling without home automation 
reach 1.46 kgCO2/h, and 1.37 in case the home automation 
is running in the dwelling. 
At the system level, the total and average hourly CO2 
emissions have decreased as well. In case the exported and 
imported electricity are accounted in the total emissions, the 
low peak occurs between 4-5 am with an average emissions 
of 0.64 ktCO2 and the high peak period occurs between 10-
11 am with an average emissions of 0.75 ktCO2 and 
cumulates 275 ktCO2 for the same hour. 
Regarding the shift of CO2 emissions due to the home 
automation device and the feedback strategies used for 
informing the private consumers, it has decreased by 6 
kgCO2 in the evening and has risen by 2.7 kgCO2 in the 
night time. The quantities of CO2 shifted, presented in Fig. 3 
(d), are different from Case 1 to Case 2 as the CO2 emission 
profile for both cases are different, as shown in Fig. 2. 
C. Discussion 
Both cases showed that load shifting can contribute to 
12.7 % decrease in CO2 emissions. However, there is a 
difference depending if the balance of import and export is 
considered.  
As well, consumer awareness and their willingness to 
comply is also a factor in the potential for reducing CO2 
emissions. Table 1 summarises the results from the CO2 
emissions and the electricity consumption from both 
dwellings.  
It is necessary to point out the importance of methods 
evaluating emissions on the results. It is paramount that the 
countries involved use the same methodology for their CO2 
evaluation. In this study, Finland is mostly importing 
electricity from Sweden and Russia and exporting to 
Norway and Estonia. For Sweden, it results in importing 
“polluted” electricity and exporting cleaner electricity to 
Finland. Consequently, for Finland, the shifting of CO2 
emissions is greater when relating the emissions to the gross 
electricity production. Multi-objective algorithms will need 
to be developed for optimising electricity consumption 
and/or CO2 emissions. In addition, an added level of 
complexity is if export/import net emissions are considered 
or not. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The article detailed the CO2 emissions of electricity 
generation in Finland. Firstly, monthly and weekly data of 
electricity generation were used to calculate corresponding 
CO2 emissions into hourly data. This was used to evaluate 
the CO2 emission profile of households. The model was 
based on hourly electricity load profiles previously built.   
Secondly, the CO2 emissions associated with imported 
and exported electricity generation were accounted as well. 
Both cases show the same peak distribution in their daily 
profile. Notwithstanding, emissions will depend on the fuel 
used at a particular hour. Therefore, the relationship 
between electricity production, import and export is not 
straightforward. The cumulated carbon emission overnight 
from the electricity produced in Finland stands at around 
290 ktCO2.h-1, while the peak reaches 345 ktCO2.h-1. 
Considering the import and export of electricity, and their 
related CO2 emissions, the peak dropped to 230 ktCO2.h-1 
overnight, and the high peak at 275 ktCO2.h-1, respectively. 
Although the home automation has not been optimised 
for reducing the CO2 emissions from the modelled 
household, the CO2 emissions from the electricity 
consumption are somehow proportional to electricity 
consumption levels. The study showed that home 
automation might reduce the carbon emission by 12.7 % 
while influencing the private consumers’ everyday routine. 
The CO2 emissions have been reduced most substantially 
during the evening peak, by 18 kgCO2/h.y-1 in the first case 
and by 6 kgCO2/h.y-1 in the second case, while the emissions 
at night time have increased from 3 to 5 kgCO2/h.y-1 on 
average. Although the CO2 emissions related to electricity 
consumption from appliances are strongly correlated, the 
energy mix for producing this electricity needs to be 
considered and thus optimised for reducing the carbon 
footprint of households.  
Consequently, smart buildings within a smart grid may 
not only participate to load shifting, increase energy 
efficiency or decrease in electricity consumption, but can 
also contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 
emissions. It will, in turn, impact the total CO2 emissions of 
the country and will assist in achieving the decarbonisation 
goal of the EU.  
This limitation of this research is that there was no 
information available on the variation of the energy mix 
from the exporting countries, therefore, the import

electricity had to be considered with a yearly constant CO2 
emission factor. Secondly, in the case of Finland, a more 
detailed estimation would require knowing the energy mix 
hour-by-hour, rather than estimating it from the monthly 
average. 
Further research will investigate the impact of private 
consumers in correlation with home automation for reducing 
the CO2 emissions of households. In addition, a full 
assessment considering district-heating systems shall be 
done, in order to achieve full integration of smart buildings 
in a smart energy network. Finally, the multi-objective 
algorithms will have to be further developed.
