Abstract— Situation awareness could be considered as one of 
the most important factors that directly influences the pilot 
operation. In order to enhance the pilots’ situation awareness, 
this research was carried out by implementing a new display 
method, chase view, in flight simulator, not only to provide the 
front view, but also the airframe configuration. During the 
experiment, the training time and attempting times, area of 
interest of eyes and the flight performance of the landing phase 
were evaluated to determine the usability of chase view. And 
according to the results, the chase view could enhance the 
situation awareness during landing phase. 
Keywords-situation awareness; chase view;  AOI; flight path.

 INTRODUCTION  
According to NASA‟s statistics, about 70%-80% of the 
aviation accidents could be attributed to the performance of 
human, and among these accidents, decision errors 
contribute to 35% [1]. Decision making, as known, is 
directly related to the situation awareness of the pilots, which 
means if pilots have a thorough consciousness about what 
happen instantly and what is going to happen about the 
components or the whole aircraft, the disaster like turning off 
the wrong faulty engine, happened on the 8th of January 1989, 
of the British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 which 
resulted in the loss of 47 lives [2] would have been avoided.   
The definition of situation awareness is formally 
described as the perception of the elements in the 
environment within a volume of time and space, the 
comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their 
status in the near future [3]. Therefore, it includes three 
levels: firstly, perceiving critical factors around; secondly, 
understanding the means of those factors; thirdly, 
understanding what will happen in the near future [4]. 
A lot of researches have been carried out to enhance the 
situation awareness of the pilots. For example, the Highway-
in-the-sky (HITS) display [5] gives the path of the aircraft, 
conveying primary flight path guidance through use of a 
tunnel-in-the-sky [6], and 2D coplanar display contains a 
top-down view of the flight environment in the top panel [7]. 
Synthetic vision systems have been already wildly used in 
the aircraft as a solution to such problems as controlled flight 
into terrain and low-visibility condition [8]. 
All the studies reviewed above were about how to present 
a clear front view of the aircraft to the pilots. However, none 
of them was dealing with the failure of the airframe if the 
annunciation in the cockpit was ambiguous, like whether the 
landing gear was correctly released, and whether the flap was 
in proper position. Under the condition of the chase view, the 
viewpoint was located above and rear the aircraft, therefore 
the information of the airframe and the front view was 
combined together to provide a more useful scene to the 
pilots. 
In this research, the chase view was used in a flight 
simulator as a method to enhance the situation awareness.  
When the subjects operated the landing phase, the 
training time and times, area of interest (AOI) of eyes [9] and 
the flight performance will be discussed later.

METHOD 
A. Apparatus 
The apparatus comprised two parts: the flight simulator 
and eye-tracking device. 
The flight simulator part, as shown in Figure 1, includes 
four workstations to simulate the landing phase and record 
the behavior of the subjects and the flight performance of the 
landing phase, six 22-in. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) 
monitors to present the display information of the aircraft 
and a spherical screen to display the outside view of the 
airplane. This flight simulator is flexible, and it could be 
easily changed to several types of aircrafts according to the 
demands. In this research, the Boeing 777 was used as 
prototype to carry out the experiments.

eye-tracking device could give out many characteristics of 
the eye movement data during the experiments like Duration 
Time, Size of Pupil, Blink Rate, and etc. In this research, the 
eye-tracking device is used to record the AOI of the subjects. 
 
B. Procedure 
A scenario of landing phase was built up in the flight 
simulator, and Boeing 777 model was used in. The typical „T‟ 
layout, however, was changed in following way: a chase 
view of the aircraft was presented in front of the subjects, 
and the Prime Flight Display (PFD), Navigation Display 
(ND) were presented in the middle display, as shown in 
Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2. Layout of Chase View 
 
Landing phase began from 2000 feet above the surface, 
and the distance was 6 nautical miles from the runway of San 
Francisco International Airport, which height is 13 feet 
above the sea level. The time to complete the landing was 
less than 2 minutes, and the whole progress was recorded by 
scene camera. During each landing, the subject needed to 
manipulate the aircraft well through control wheel and 
throttle. Moreover, they needed to lower the landing gear at 
1000 feet, and to drop the flaps at 500 feet. This scenario was 
built up according to the Pilot Operation Procedure and 
Flight Crew Training Manual [10]. 
Before the real experiment, the subjects were given some 
training time to be familiar with the operations in the flight 
simulator, and the time and times to finish the first landing 
completely (landing on the runway) from the very beginning 
were recorded during the practice.  
After training and the calibration of eye-tracking device, 
the experiment was carried out. Each subject was asked to 
accomplish three landing, no matter landing on the runway 
or crashing, the times and eyes parameters were recorded for 
analysis and discussion. 
 
C. Participants 
Eight master students from the School of Aeronautics 
and Astronautics to be the subjects, who all have aviation 
studying background more than 2 years, were participated in 
this experiment. They have the knowledge on aircraft design, 
and know well about the landing process, but without 
experience on how to manipulate an aircraft in a flight 
simulator. Among the eight subjects, the whole average age 
was 20.53 (SD=1.24).  
The same eight students also manipulated the same B777 
model, however, the layout of display was the normal way 
after a week, and they just provided comparative data in 
practical phrase.   
 
D. Measurements 
The collection of measurements accomplished through 
two phrases as following.  
Firstly, during the practice, each subjects had 20 minutes 
of test-flight. At this process, the total time and attempting 
times of each subject to finish the first landing completely 
(landing on the runway), and the overall times of successful 
landing in training were recorded. These data would give 
some advices on training time and training strategy in some 
extent. 
Secondly, during the experiment, the eye movement of 
each subject was recorded by eye-tracking system. Eye 
movement could reflect the attention of the subject allocated 
when he/ she completes a task. These data were used to 
determine the AOI of each subject when he/ she carried out 
the landing. The AOI comprised four parts: Chase View area; 
Primary Flight Display area; Outside area and Other area. 
Furthermore, the whole flight process of each subject was 
also recorded.  
 
III. 
RESULTS 
A. A ttempting Times and Time for first landing  
Among the eight subjects, two of them finished the 
landing on runway within 5 times, three of them between 6-8 
times, one in 9 times, one above 10 times, and one did not 
land successfully, as shown in Table 1.  
Except the subject who did not complete landing, the 
mean times of other subjects is 6.71 (SD = 2.81), which is 
much smaller than the times by normal layout of B777 in the 
same flight simulator that is the mean times is 9.17 (SD = 
3.49), and the mean times of landing in training is 3.37 (SD 
=1.85). 
And the other data of subjects who operated under 
normal layout is shown in Table 2, and the comparative 
results of attempting times and times of landing are shown in 
Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.

From Figure 3 and Figure 4, both on times of successful 
landing and the attempting times, the Chase View is better 
than Normal Layout. Furthermore, ANOVA analysis was 
used to determine the significance. Comparing times of 
successful landing, the effect is significant (F = 5.81, p<0.05), 
however, the effect on attempting times is not significant 
enough (F = 1.56, p>0.23). 
B. AOI and Flight Performance 
As described above, the areas of interest included four 
parts: Chase View area (CVA); Primary Flight Display area 
(PFDA); Outside area (OUTA) and Other area (OA).  
Each subject was needed to accomplish three landing, no 
matter landing on the runway or crashing. The flight 
performance determining here are by the times of successful 
landing in three attempts and whether the landing is 
overweight landing or not. Table 3 gives mean seconds that 
each subject paid on different areas within the three landing.

combines three main areas: CVA, PFDA and OA. Subjects 2, 
4 and 6 also did good job. Comparing their patterns, they 
paid more attention on the Chase View area. Subject 1, 3 and 
8 did common during the experiment. There were almost no 
focus of outside area of subjects 1 and 3, and subject 8 paid 
more attention on other area. The performance of subject 5 
was bad. However, it was consistent with the performance in 
training phase. This may because that the subject 5 felt 
frustration during the practice, and did not cooperate well 
during the experiment. 
Furthermore, to determine the correlation of each area 
with attempting time, the correlation coefficients were 
calculated as follow Table 5.

According to the correlation coefficients, CVA, PFDA 
and OUTA had negative correlations with attempting time, 
since CVA gave out the state of the aircraft on certain 
moment, PFDA provided the main control information and 
OUTA supplied the situation awareness of what was 
happening in front of the aircraft. All of these are essential to 
safe flight and successful landing, while OA had a positive 
correlation with attempting time. Moreover, the abstract 
value of correlation coefficient of CVA versus attempting 
time was not as high as expect, however, the correlation 
coefficient of OA versus attempting time was high, which 
was consistent with the expectation. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The main aim of this research was to examine the 
influence of Chase View on landing phase. The research 
included two phases: training phase and experimental phase.  
In training phase, the comparative data between the 
Chase View and the normal layout show that, to novices, the 
different on attempting times to first landing was not obvious. 
The disparity, however on times of successful landing was 
significant. Therefore, subjects performed better under the 
condition of Chase View than normal layout. This could be 
considered that Chase View would be helpful during the 
early training period. It could enhance the experience of the 
novice about how the aircraft really operates in the real 
environment quickly, and arouse the interest to manipulate it. 
The results during the experiments showed that the flight 
performance was closely related to the distribution of eyes 
focus of the subject, and the Chase View improved the flight 
performance in some extent. However, the recommended 
pattern was to combine the Chase View, PFD and Outside 
parts together. It also means that the PFD information 
indispensable not only to pilots, but also to the novices. 
Furthermore, from the recorded video of eye-tracking device, 
when the eyes attention located on PFD area, the subjects 
were almost observing the information of speed and altitude. 
This was reasonable, since the attitude information could be 
obtained from Chase View, and the speed and altitude are 
also essential for landing. Moreover, Outside View is also 
important, especially to the novices, but not necessary. This 
is a common sense. After effective training, the pilots must 
have the skill to land under the condition of minimum 
visibility requirements by instrument landing system. 
According to the analysis of correlation coefficients, the 
abstract value of correlation coefficient of CVA versus 
attempting time was not as high as expect. It is probable that 
the smart combination of CVA, PFDA and OUTA that 
contributes an excellent performance. And the correlation 
coefficient of OA versus attempting time was high, which 
was consistent with the expectation, since the more irrelevant 
attention paid the probability of terrible performance was 
higher. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTIRE WORK 
In this research, the Chase View was used in the flight 
simulator. According to the analysis of the training 
performance and the flight performance, the Chase View 
could be helpful during the early training period and improve 
the training efficiency.  During the landing phase, although 
the Chase View cannot replace the normal layout, it could 
enhance the situation awareness of the operators.  
Further study would be carried out in several aspects. 
Firstly, more subjects will be anticipated in the training 
phase, and the training time will be expended. Then, the 
performances of Chase View and normal layout could be 
compared to determine whether the enhancement of situation 
awareness is significant or not, and the appropriate pattern of 
combination of CVA, PFDA and OUTA which would result 
in a better performance will also be considered.
