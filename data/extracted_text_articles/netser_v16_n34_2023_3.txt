Abstract—This paper presents a novel zero-touch-design 
information-centric wireless sensor network for smart-city 
applications. To promote self-growing in an autonomous-
distributed environment, the proposed scheme adopts zero-
touch technology implemented using micro-operators and 
micro-service providers with a focus on the lower layers where 
sensor nodes join the network. The scheme also aims to improve 
the overall availability by utilizing proxy caching and 
fragmented data management schemes. Computer simulations 
revealed that, for large-size sensing data (e.g., rich sensing data), 
the proposed scheme performs better when used with 
millimeter-wavelength band wireless networks. The results also 
showed that the scheme is effective in terms of availability and 
energy consumption. This study is a part of our ongoing 
research on the development of an ecosystem that enables a 
smart-city-as-a-service platform, where we are currently 
focused on the development and experimental trials through on-
site testing.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Internet of things (IoT) has stimulated new trends and 
empowered innovative new developments in smart devices. 
The deployment of such devices at distributed locations is a 
typical scenario in smart-city applications. Wireless sensor 
networks (WSNs) are an elemental technology in this regard, 
and they require rapid deployment, initial configuration, and 
sensing-data provisioning, all of which remain challenging. 
Moreover, in next-generation wireless networks, such as 
beyond the fifth generation (5G), massive IoT devices will be 
deployed in a heterogeneous environment across multiple 
network domains and versatile service slices. Therefore, for 
scalability and sustainability, the IoT platform must be shifted 
from a centralized cloud-based framework to an autonomous-
decentralized edge-based one that allows access from various 
end-users and applications ranging from individuals to 
enterprises or governments [2]. 
In light of this background, we focus on two key 
technologies: zero-touch and data-centric. The zero-touch 
design aims to completely automate the network management 
process to minimize the initial costs and set up individual 
execution environments. Ever since a zero-touch-design 
system was utilized in the first Linux operating system, there 
have been increased demands for service deployments that are 
versatile and flexible in cloud-native micro-services. As for 
the data-centric architecture, information-centric networking 
(ICN) (e.g., a content-centric network or named-data network) 
can be utilized to transform the current network world (e.g., 
the Internet). ICN natively supports functionalities, such as 
abstraction, naming, and in-network caching, which enables 
the data to be decoupled from its original location and the 
security of every piece of data to be adopted in the network 
layer. Combining ICN with WSNs is suitable for an 
autonomous-decentralized 
environment, 
which 
yields 
Information-Centric 
Wireless 
Sensor 
Networking 
(ICWSN) [3]. 
In our previous study [4], we investigated an ICWSN-
based ecosystem with a blockchain for smart-city applications 
utilizing a scheme that achieves efficient and reliable caching. 
We also presented a blueprint for the system design of a zero-
touch-design ICWSN on which the actual smart-city 
application services will be deployed [1]. In the current paper, 
utilizing these prior studies as a basis, we evolve and expand 
the ICWSN system with a focus on reliability and availability. 
We interpret reliability here as a benchmark indicating that the 
system operates correctly throughout a certain time interval, 
i.e., that a reliable system can tolerate any error that may occur 
(fault tolerant). We interpret availability as an indicator that a 
system is operating correctly and can continue running its 
functions at any time, i.e., a system with high availability 
should have undetectable periods of inaccessibility. In the 
proposed scheme, for reliability, we utilize a micro-operator 
(μO), where a network node can be joined only after the μO 
verifies its individual information when it turns on. 
For system deployment in actual smart cities, to reduce the 
effort required for initialization, the first step is to enable 
automatic participation by the ICWSN. To this end, for zero-
touch design, the proposed scheme also uses a micro-service 
provider (μSP). For the management of device information 
and application-service types in μOs and μSPs, the proposed 
scheme utilizes blockchain-based ledgers, as both the ICWSN 
and blockchain can work together under an autonomous-
decentralized network without mutual trust. However, in 
ICWSNs, the network nodes are typically limited to resources 
and thus cannot feasibly support the blockchain network. The 
μOs provide a solution in that the proposed scheme guarantees 
the trustworthiness of the nodes during an initial process.

Therefore, the data generated by a reliable node can be trusted 
without needing to receive any additional verification. For this 
reason, blockchain-based storage for the data no longer 
requires traditional computation-intensive mining, and the 
blockchain can simply select alternative consensus schemes, 
(e.g., proof-of-authority or proof-of-elapsed-time algorithms) 
instead of the traditional ones [5]. For availability 
improvement, the proposed scheme utilizes proxy caching and 
cooperative data management schemes, where the proxy 
caching scheme transfers the role of responding to the sensing 
data from relatively low-reliability nodes to more reliable ones, 
and the cooperative data management is applied among the 
nodes that assigned the task of the proxy caching scheme. 
In the proposed scheme, the protocol stacks are placed on 
the ICN layer of the wireless local area network (WLAN). 
Another option would be to directly place them on the datalink 
and physical layers, but this is not general purpose since it 
requires the construction of a special protocol suite. In 
addition, to support rich 3D sensing applications, virtual 
reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, etc., in a future 
innovative society, the WLAN underpinning the proposed 
scheme should select the mesh network based on two radio-
frequency 
bands, 
microwave 
and 
millimeter-wave 
(mmWave,) which are respectively specified as IEEE 
802.11 ac/ax and IEEE 802.11 ad/ay. In our evaluation and 
feasibility demonstration of the proposed scheme, we focus on 
these two radio bands while performing system modeling, 
computer simulation, testbed development, and a fundamental 
experiment.  
Section II of this paper presents an overview of the 
traditional technologies related to our work, and Section III 
describes the proposed scheme. In Section IV, we report the 
numerical results, and in Section V, we present the 
experimental results using a hardware-based testbed device. 
Related works are discussed in Section VI. We conclude in 
Section VII with a brief summary and mention of future work. 
 
II. 
WIDEBAND INFORMATION-CENTRIC WIRELESS 
NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES 
Various wireless communications and network systems 
have been investigated to meet different requirements 
regarding sensing-data collection, distribution, security, and 
privacy. This section presents an overview of ICWSNs and 
mmWave WLANs for wideband wireless communications. 
A. Information-centric wireless sensor network 
The ICWSN system deals with individual data as named 
data. For named data, one of two naming rules can be selected, 
hierarchical or flat, depending on the situation in which the 
ICWSN is deployed. When the data are wirelessly forwarded, 
the network nodes along the routing path cache (copy and 
store) them in the local storage for further retrieval of the same 
data. The caching method is generally categorized into on-
path caching or off-path caching. On-path caching is an in-
network caching scheme in typical ICNs, whereas in off-path 
caching, the nodes around the routing path also actively cache. 
Wireless communications are typically provided in a flooding 
(broadcasting) style, unlike wired networks, and this specific 
characteristic (i.e., overhearing phenomena) is what enables 
the off-path caching to be implemented. Thanks to these 
caching methods, the sensing data can be effectively expanded, 
making the retrieval accelerative. 
In the ICN layer, data packets are mainly transferred as 
interest and response packets. When data retrieval is 
performed, the requester sends the target packet to interest the 
network as an acquisition of the data. The node that receives 
the interest packet and matches the target data for this request 
plays the role of responder. The responder replies with the 
response packet encapsulated by the data. Note that, since the 
data is not distinguished from either the original or the cached 
data, the interest packet consists of data-requestor information 
and the properties of the required data. In contrast, the 
response packet includes the named data with a digital 
signature and lifetime (data freshness). For data exchange, the 
interest packets are forwarded to send back the data, and the 
trace information is recorded in the forwarding information 
base (FIB), which stores the outgoing interface(s) for each 
known naming prefix. The intermediate network nodes each 
have a pending interest table (PIT) that keeps a record of the 
incoming interfaces and the interest-packet information. The 
response packet follows the reverse path guided by the PIT 
entries, and these traversal records are removed while 
forwarding the data. 
B. Wireless communications in mmWave band 
The steadily increasing global demand for higher 
bandwidth has motivated the exploration of the underutilized 
mmWave spectrum. As shown in Figure 1, this spectrum has 
a higher potential than the microwave band (e.g., the sub-6-
GHz and sub-GHz bands) and can be made available for much 
larger bandwidth allocation to enable the use of beamforming 
for greater spatial reuse. Historically, the mmWave has been 
utilized for fixed wireless access, but standards defined as 
IEEE 802.11 ad/ay have been commonly provided in the 60-
GHz band [6] as well. Radio propagation in the mmWave 
band is characterized as free-space path loss and precipitation 
attenuation, which are typically a few dB per kilometer, unless 
heavy rain causes a significant attenuation (15 dB/km in 
 
Figure 1. Evolution and history of wireless local area network in IEEE 
802.11 specifications.

150 mm/hr). The 60-GHz band has further attenuation due to 
oxygen and the water concentration of objects, i.e., the 57–
64 GHz bands are high-oxygen absorbing bands with 10–
15 dB/km, and the moisture it contains (e.g., from leaves and 
humans) results in particularly strong attenuation across the 
radio path. 
IEEE 802.11 ad is a member of the IEEE 802.11 family 
and the pioneer in standardizing the 60-GHz band (i.e., in the 
unlicensed 57–66 GHz bands). IEEE 802.11 ay is the latest 
standard for expanding the data-transmission rate up to 
30 Gbit/s. The 60-GHz band has a greater amount of available 
bandwidth than all other unlicensed bands (e.g., 2.4, 5, and 
6 GHz), but rain and atmosphere make the radio links useless; 
thus, it is currently utilized only for short-range indoor 
environments. This should be reconsidered because today’s 
cellular-base-station cell size in urban areas is on the order of 
200 m, which offers greater flexibility in the deployment of 
outdoor scenarios. Terragraph (TG) is an IEEE 802.11 ad/ay-
compliant platform developed by Meta (Facebook) and has 
been successfully deployed by mobile operators and Internet 
service providers for the backhaul in wireless mesh 
networks [7]. 
The physical layer of mmWave WLAN uses a phased-
array antenna to execute beamforming between the transmitter 
and receiver side nodes since the mmWave propagation 
results in severe path loss and signal attenuation. Note that 
beamforming technology can concentrate the transmission 
power and the receiver region over narrow beams. The 
medium 
access 
control 
(MAC) 
layer 
has 
similar 
functionalities to the traditional microwave band; however, 
TG’s design only supports the single carrier PHY mode and 
12 types of modulation and coding scheme (MCS) sets with 
data rates up to 4.6 Gbit/s. 
III. 
PROPOSED SCHEME 
We introduce a receiver-side cooperation design into the 
ICWSN system to improve availability. The proposed scheme 
features two key technologies: proxy caching and fragmented 
data management. After modeling the ICWSN system, we 
describe the proposed scheme on the basis of the model. 
A. Network model 
The network structure of the proposed scheme consists of 
three main network sections: an ICWSN, an edge network, 
and a cloud network, as shown in Figure 2. The ICWSN 
includes sensor nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) as network 
nodes that are centrally orchestrated by a mobile base station 
(MBS). The SNs can perform a pull operation to answer the 
inquiries of other network nodes. Note that, in traditional 
WSNs, the sensing data is gathered for the cloud servers (push 
operation), and users retrieve it as needed. The SNs and RNs 
are both distributed across the smart-city area, and the SNs 
sense physical values. The sensing data are provided to users 
and then partially aggregated to the cloud network via the RNs 
and MBS. The RNs forward the data (as well as the legacy 
WSNs), and the data are cached in the local storage of the RNs 
(as well as the typical ICNs) during the data-forwarding 
process. The MBS is connected to both the ICWSN and the 
edge network, so it is relatively more resourceful than the SNs 
and RNs. The cloud network includes a storage server and a 
broker. The broker intermediates between the ICWSNs, edge 
networks, cloud networks, and users, i.e., it exchanges and 
translates the sensing data and the control messages between 
them as a gateway. This functionality enables interoperability 
between multiple regional ICWSNs and provides global 
scalability. The storage server stores and provides the (copied) 
partial caching data. Finally, the users are those who consume 
and obtain the data. 
The proposed scheme utilizes two service providers to 
overlay the physical network for reliability and a zero-touch 
design: a micro-operator (μO) and a micro-service provider 
(μSP). The μO verifies whether the SNs can join the ICWSN 
and provides them with the required connectivity. The 
information provided here comprises either the authentication 
that an SN is a proper member of the ICWSN or the network 
construction settings for wireless transmissions. The former 
information is provided by the μO, and the latter is managed 
using the FIB in the RNs, MBS, and broker. The μSP provides 
the application service and its setting information for the 
registered SNs to perform as a specified actuator in the 
ICWSN. Namely, when an SN device is turned on, it sends a 
registration request to the μO and establishes a secure Virtual 
Private Network (VPN) link if approved. An ICWSN with a 
VPN implements the orchestration of distant ICWSNs, 
terminal fixation at the datalink layer, and secure data 
exchanges. After joining the network, the SN downloads and 
installs a configuration setting and application software from 
the μSP. (The detailed procedures regarding the initialization 
and registration are described in later sections.) In the 
proposed scheme, the databases to be referenced by μO and 
μSP should be used as distributed databases, such as a 
blockchain. This design principle ensures scalability across 
interregional networks with different governments, operators, 
and providers, which is effective in the smart-city scenario 
assumed in this paper. 
As shown in Figure 2, as a network architecture, the 
proposed scheme uses a mesh network with IEEE 802.11 
WLANs in the microwave and mmWave bands in the lower 
 
Figure 2. Overview of proposed scheme.

layer. Since the ICWSN is constructed using WLANs, the 
ICWSN and edge network are in a closed local area network; 
meanwhile, we assume these networks can access the Internet 
via the wired or cellular network for global connection. The 
SNs, RNs, and MBSs can be virtually placed on the physical 
network in the middle layer, but they should also be placed on 
the WLAN access points for practical reasons related to 
location, power supply, and wireless features. The μOs and 
μSPs are deployed in the upper layer as a functionality of the 
overlay network technology. 
B. Proxy caching scheme 
One of the problems with ICWSNs is that SNs can 
suddenly disappear due to a lack of energy supply or the 
failure of a (cheap) device, and their turnover (including 
participating and withdrawing) is rapid because of node 
mobility. We overcome this problem by utilizing a proxy 
caching scheme, which ensures availability even in this 
situation. 
An ICWSN consists of an MBS, several RNs, and several 
SNs, which can be expressed as a set of { ℛ, 𝒮 }. The set of 
RNs and SNs are respectively represented as ℛ ≜
{𝑟0, 𝑟1, 𝑟2, ⋯ , 𝑟|ℛ|} and 𝒮 ≜ { 𝑠1, 𝑠2, ⋯ , 𝑠|𝒮| }. Note that 𝑟0 is 
the MBS and the others are RNs, and the operator |𝒳| is the 
number of elements in the set of 𝒳. In the proxy caching 
scheme, the RNs around an SN are assigned as the SN’s 
alternative nodes, named Proxy RNs (PRNs). The set of PRNs 
ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖 assigned to ∀𝑠𝑖 (∈ 𝒮, 𝑖 = 1,2, ⋯ , |𝒮|) is given by 
 
      ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖 ≜ Ω(ℛ|𝑠𝑖) = {𝑟̂1
𝑠𝑖, 𝑟̂2
𝑠𝑖, ⋯ , 𝑟̂|ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖|
𝑠𝑖
}, 
 
      (1) 
 
where Ω(ℛ|𝑠) is a function that lists up the set of RNs in 
which the members of ℛ can be connected to 𝑠. In addition, 
we assume that the SN does not belong to multiple ICWSNs, 
i.e., there is no roaming across multiple μOs. In proxy-
caching-enabled data retrieval, if 𝑠𝑖 does not respond to the 
data-query request for any reason, one of the ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖  answers 
instead of 𝑠𝑖 . The privilege of each ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖  is prioritized in 
accordance with its index, from small to large; specifically, 
𝑟̂1
𝑠𝑖  is called the primary PRN. The priority among ℛ̂ 𝑥𝑖  is 
determined based on the wireless channel condition when the 
SN is initially registered to the ICWSN or should be re-
registered when it moves. 
C. Data fragmentation and its cooperative management 
For the data fragmentation and management scheme, let 
𝑋𝑠𝑖,𝑡 denote the data generated by 𝑠𝑖 at time 𝑡. The expired 
data, 𝑋𝑠𝑖,𝑡+𝑡0, no longer has any value, where 𝑡0 is the period 
of valid data. If the data size is large, it is divided into smaller 
chunks. Let 𝛿𝑠𝑖𝑡  denote the number of fragmentations for 
𝑋𝑠𝑖,𝑡; then, this method can be expressed as  
 
      𝑋𝑠𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑥1
𝑠𝑖,𝑡 ⊕ 𝑥2
𝑠𝑖,𝑡 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ 𝑥𝛿𝑠𝑖,𝑡
𝑠𝑖,𝑡 , 
 
    (2) 
 
where the operator ⊕ is a bit-by-bit combining. The PRNs 
cooperatively deal with the divided data and not only perform 
data backup but also reduce the cost of unnecessary 
stockholding when the data becomes worthless. 
When not all data is complete during alternative data 
retrieval, the primary PRN gathers the partial loss of chunks 
from the other PRNs and compiles them. Among PRNs, the 
primary PRN is most likely to store the divided data, and the 
amount of available data will be limited in accordance with 
the size of its index. In some cases, however, only a certain 
chunk may be lost, which can be dealt with by using the 
scheme of erasure code and cooperative communications [8]. 
Using this technique, even if not all the data is complete (i.e., 
if some of them are lacking), the original data can be fully 
restored based on the incomplete divided data. 
D. Procedure of proposed scheme 
In this section, we present the signal processing procedure 
of the proposed scheme. When a new SN is appended to the 
ICWSN, it must be identified and its information recorded on 
the member nodes of the ICWSN. As shown in Figure 3(a), 
the SN sends a registration request to the neighbor RNs, and 
the message is then forwarded between RNs and delivered to 
the μO via the MBS. Note that the SN selects a primary PRN 
from among the available PRNs here. The μO inquires and 
verifies the SN’s identification to the blockchain network. If 
the SN is officially approved and activated, the μO sends back 
the message of complete registration. In this process, the MBS 
registers the SN as a member of the ICWSN, and the PRNs 
know that it is the SN to which they should provide a proxy 
caching mechanism. In addition, it is properly updated in the 
FIB of the MBS and the RNs on the traced-back routing path. 
After the SN has been registered, it requests a pre-defined 
execution (actuation) from the μSP and downloads the 
application (and its configuration) to enable a zero-touch 
initialization. Note that a kind of image file is downloaded 
data for the virtual operating system (e.g., Docker). 
When the SN moves, it takes over the task of the proxy 
caching scheme for the new PRNs, which includes selecting 
and registering them. As shown in Figure 3(b), the SN sends 
a withdrawal request to the current PRNs, but the primary 
PRN temporarily keeps this request on hold, and the SN 
simultaneously sends a reconstruction request to the 
neighboring RNs in a new location. A new primary PRN is 
selected and broadcasts the decision to the ICWSN. On the 
basis of this notification, the old primary PRN accepts the 
withdrawal request and removes its task from the old PRNs. 
In addition, the new and old PRNs should update their FIB at 
the same time. Through this process, the set of PRNs is 
changed from ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖  to ℛ̂ 𝑠′𝑖  corresponding to the movement 
from 𝑠𝑖 to 𝑠𝑖
′, which is given by 
 
      ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖
′  ≜ Ω( ℛ|𝑠𝑖
′ ). 
 
 
 
      (3) 
 
The PRNs of { ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖  ∪ ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖
′ − ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖
′ } remove the registered 𝑠𝑖, 
and the RNs of { ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖
′ − ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖  ∩ ℛ̂ 𝑠𝑖
′ } newly register it. If the 
user moves to a different ICWSN, it is necessary to obtain the 
wireless-connection information from the μO and re-install 
and reconfigure the application service from the μSP. 
If the radio channel is temporarily degraded (e.g., in the 
case of not receiving the data continuously), it is expected to 
recover over time, but since the reason typically originates 
from a failure of the SN device (e.g., a lack of battery supply, 

67

continuous busy status, or permanent poor radio condition), 
the RNs should detect the cause and reassign the PRNs 
accordingly. As shown in Figure 3(c), the primary PRN 
initiates and sends the diagnosis message to the other PRNs. 
If the PRNs without a primary PRN have also not received the 
data, the result is reported to the μO, and then the appropriate 
action is conducted, such as notifying the manager to repair 
the SN device. When one of the PRNs has received the data, 
i.e., the primary PRN’s radio channel is permanently worse, 
the secondary PRN takes over the primary PRN’s task: 
specifically, the primary PRN sends the change of primary 
assignment message to the secondary PRN to switch their 
duties. If the secondary PRN suffers from a similar situation, 
it can be replaced by the third PRN, thus maintaining an 
optimal primary PRN selection. 
If the data-requestor cannot directly access the ICWSN, 
(e.g., if a user cannot access the ICWSN via the Internet), the 
interest packet is alternatively sent from the broker. Note that 
users are not limited to human users, they also include the 
machine that periodically retrieves the collected data. As 
shown in Figure 3(d), if the required data have been cached in 
the cloud network, MBS, or RNs close to the MBS, the 
responder node replies with the cached data; otherwise, the 
primary PRN answers. 
E. Formulation of proposed scheme’s availability 
In this section, we formulate the effect of the proposed 
scheme in terms of availability. When introducing system 
reliability engineering to the network research field, we can 
define availability as the probability of a data-retrieval request 
being successfully answered. The availability of the system 
can be calculated based on the summation of the network 
node’s availability and the outage probability of wireless 
networks. The network node’s availability 𝐴  is calculated 
based on 
 
      𝐴 = 𝑇MTBF / ( 𝑇MTBF  + 𝑇MTTR ), 
 
      (4) 
 
where 𝑇MTBF is the mean time between failures and 𝑇MTTR is 
the mean time to repair. As for the outage probability of the 
wireless link, 𝑝o , it is determined based on the radio-
frequency band and radio-propagation environment, which 
will be modeled and illustrated in the next section. 
Let 𝐴SN, 𝐴RN, and 𝐴MBS denote the availability of SN, RN, 
and MBS, respectively. The RNs located close to the MBS 
have a greater effect on the availability of the overall system 
due to not only hardware failure but also network traffic (and 
its congestion). To simplify our analysis here, we ignore this 
effect, i.e., we assume the average availability, 𝐴̅RN, for all 
RNs. For the same reason, we use the average outage 
probability, 𝑝̅o , instead of 𝑝o  for time-varying channel 
conditions. Let 𝐴conv and 𝐴prop denote the availability of the 
overall conventional scheme and the proposed scheme, 
respectively, which can be calculated based on 
 
      𝐴conv = (1 − 𝑝̅o)𝐴SN ⋅ 𝐴MBS ⋅ ∏
(1 − 𝑝̅o) 𝐴̅RN
𝑁𝑠𝑖
𝑛=1
       (5) 
 
and 
 
      𝐴prop = 𝐴PRN
𝑠𝑖
⋅ 𝐴MBS ⋅ ∏
(1 − 𝑝̅o) 𝐴̅RN
𝑁𝑠𝑖−1
𝑛=1
, 
      (6) 
 
where 𝑁𝑠𝑖 is the number of hops from the primary PRN of 𝑠𝑖 
to the MBS, and 𝐴PRN
𝑠𝑖
 is the availability of the PRNs for 𝑠𝑖, 
which is given by 
 
      𝐴PRN
𝑠𝑖
≜ 1 − [ 1 − (1 − 𝑝̅o)𝐴̅RN ]|𝒮̂[𝑠𝑖]|.  
      (7) 
 
 
Figure 3. Procedure of the proposed scheme: (a) an SN is newly 
appended to the ICWSN, (b) the SN moves and changes its PRNs, (c) the 
SN’s data does not reach the PRNs, and (d) the data is retrieved for the 
ICWSN from the users (data consumers).

By comparing (5) and (6), the availability section of the 
SN in the first term is replaced by a parallel RN, which leads 
to an availability improvement thanks to the proxy caching. 
This is because, the relationship between them is 𝐴RN > 𝐴SN, 
since the SNs are generally cheap and massively spread 
around in the observation area. At the same time, we need to 
ensure that 𝐴MBS has a smaller failure rate, since the MBS is 
the single point of failure in a physical ICWSN and the 
proposed mechanism cannot change this. We adopt a high-
reliability (industrial use) hardware device as a testbed 
demonstration in order to mitigate this issue, as discussed in 
the later section. It should therefore have the highest 
availability compared to all other nodes, i.e., 𝐴MBS ≫ 𝐴RN >
𝐴SN. 
F. Modeling of wireless communications 
Radio propagation in the microwave and mmWave bands 
is typically characterized as free-space path loss. This can 
generally be represented as 
 
 𝐿∝𝑑 = 20 log10(λ/4π𝑑0) + 20 log10(𝑑/𝑑0)  +χs (dB),   (8) 
 
where λ (= 300/𝑓c MHz) is the wavelength of the carrier 
frequency 𝑓c, 𝑑 is the distance between the transmitter- and 
receiver-side nodes, and 𝑑0  is the closed-in free-space 
reference distance (typically set to 100 m). χs is a shadowing 
variation, i.e., it is a random variable with a Gaussian 
distribution. Using the practical-experiment-based radio 
propagation model, (8) can be rewritten as 
 
      𝐿∝𝑑 = α + β ⋅ 10 log(𝑑) + χs (dB), 
 
      (9) 
 
where α and β are decided based on the individual radio 
propagation model. For example, we select the model of Erceg 
et al. [9] for the link between the nodes on the ground and the 
model of Amorim et al. [10] for the link between the ground- 
and air-nodes, as these models are formulated based on the 
experimental measurements for their respective practical 
scenarios. Specifically, in Erceg’s model, in particular, β can 
be given by 
 
      β = (𝑎 − 𝑏ℎ + 𝑐/ℎ) + ε ⋅ 𝑧, 
 
 
    (10) 
 
where ℎ denotes the antenna height, 𝑧 is a random variable 
with the Gaussian distribution of 𝒩(0, 1), and 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, and ε 
are constant values depending on the surrounding 
environment [9]. In Amorim’s model, α and β are constantly 
given depending on the UAV altitude [10]. 
In the microwave band, the link budget, i.e., the 
relationship between the transmission power 𝑃TX and received 
signal strength 𝑃RX
microwave, is represented by 
 
      𝑃RX
microwave = 𝑃TX − 𝐿∝𝑑 + 𝐺ANT − 𝐿DEV (dB), 
    (11) 
 
where 𝐺ANT and 𝐿DEV are the antenna gain and device loss, on 
both the transmitter- and receiver-side nodes. In contrast, the 
radio propagation in the mmWave band is characterized as not 
only free-space path loss but also precipitation attenuation, 
which is typically a few decibels per kilometer, unless heavy 
rain. The moisture is influenced by the presence of natural 
materials (e.g., leaves, humans), which results in particularly 
strong attenuation across the radio path. Therefore, the 
received signal strength in the mmWave is given by 
 
      𝑃RX
mmWave = 𝑃TX − 𝐿∝𝑑 + 𝐺ANT − 𝐿DEV 
                           −𝐿RAIN − 𝐿O2 − 𝐿H2O           (dB) 
    (12) 
 
where 𝐿RAIN, 𝐿O2, and 𝐿H2O are atmosphere attenuation due 
to rain, oxygen, and natural moisture materials, respectively. 
The statistical distribution of the outage probability under 
the condition that 𝑃RX exceeds the desired signal power 𝑃min 
can thus be given by  
 
      𝑝o = Pr (𝑃𝑅𝑋 > 𝑃min) = 1 − 𝑄 (
𝑃RX−𝐿∝𝑑
𝑆𝜎2
), 
    (13) 
 
where 𝑄(𝑥) is the Gaussian Q function defined as 
 
      𝑄(𝑦) ≜ ∫

    (14) 
 
When 𝑝o is simply obtained from the received power, (13) 
suffices; otherwise, in practice, the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) should be considered in accordance with the 
modulation method and additive noise. In this case, (13) is 
rewritten as 
 
      𝑝o = Pr(𝛾𝑠 < 𝛾0) = ∫

where 𝛾𝑠 is the received SNR and 𝛾0 is the required SNR. 
IV. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION 
In this section, we conduct computer simulations to clarify 
the conditions under which the proposed system can perform, 
identify numerical examples of availability, and evaluate its 
power consumption for deployment in a smart city. 
A. Simulation environment 
The computer simulations were implemented in C++ 
language on a PC (Windows 10 OS, Core i5 2.9 GHz, 16 GB 
RAM). Assuming an experimental network composed of 
1,000 SNs, ten RNs, and an MBS, we implemented a scenario 
in which all SNs send the sensing data to the MBS via the 
PRNs. In the simulation, these nodes are deployed in a 1-km2 
area. The communication range of the nodes is equal in 
distance and all of them have the same outage probability. 
B. Conditions under which the proposed system performs 
Let ℓ denote the distance between the SN and RN and ρ 
denote the number of randomly distributed RNs per km2. 
Figure 4 shows the relationship between the number of SNs 
that do not have PRNs in the case where ρ = 50, 100, 150, 200, 
and 250. As ℓ increases, the percentage of SNs with no PRNs 
decreases because the RNs that come under the coverage of 
the SN increase. Here, ℓ should be kept as small as possible 
because increasing it would require additional energy 
consumption for wireless communications. Note that, 
according 
to 
Shannon’s 
information 
theory, 
the 
communication capacity is linearly increased based on the 
radio bandwidth and logarithmically increased based on the

2023, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
SNR, and thus more energy consumption is necessary to 
expand the communication distance of ℓ. In addition, for 
larger ρ, the area assigned to the RNs as the PRNs becomes 
smaller, and thus the percentage also decreases. Since a larger 
ρ  requires the placement of more RNs with higher 
functionalities (i.e., more expensive hardware equipment) 
compared to SN, ρ should be reduced from the viewpoint of 
cost reduction. Consequently, we set ℓ  = 200 m, 150 m, 
120 m, 100 m, and 80 m for ρ = 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250, 
respectively, as the minimum communication distance under 
no SNs without having PRNs. The computer simulation 
results will be evaluated on the basis of these parameters. 
For data retrievals, Figure 5 shows the probability of 
successful data acquisition for the average outage probability 
of the wireless link 𝑝̅o. Figure 5(a) shows the case where the 
ICWSN responds to the proposed method of PRN cooperation, 
while (b) shows the case where only PPRN responds. As we 
can see, the curves in the cases of different ρ overlap and the 
evaluation results do not differ, which indicates that the data 
retrievals are not affected if a sufficient ℓ is assured and 
determined for ρ. Therefore, the proposed scheme is available 
(scalable) if appropriate parameters are given for the network 
scale for the pair of ρ and ℓ that makes up the parameters 
determined depending on the observation-area environment. 
As shown in Figure 5(a), the proposed scheme can reduce the 
response failures to 5% or less under 𝑝̅o < 0.4: specifically, the 
probability of data-retrieval success is 0.986, 0.978, 0.974, 
and 0.966 in the case where 𝑝̅o  = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, 
respectively. From this result and the comparison of 
Figures 5(a) and (b), it is clear that the proposed scheme can 
improve the probability of data-retrieval success by 9.87%, 
23.79%, 39.22%, and 60.65% in the case where 𝑝̅o = 0.1, 0.2, 
0.3, and 0.4, respectively, thanks to a PRN cooperation. 
However, in the case where 𝑝̅o > 0.5, i.e., under the poor 
wireless channel condition, the curves experience rapid 
degradation, making it difficult to improve the data-retrieval 
success even if the proposed scheme is introduced. 
Figure 6 shows the mean number of PRNs with which the 
PPRN requests cooperation to collect data for PRNs. 
Specifically, this result represents the number of PRNs 
required to cooperate with each other until all the data 
divisions are completed. In Figure 6(a), the number of 
fragmentations is set to 10, while in (b), thanks to the erasure 
code, we assume that the original data can be recovered if ten 
of the 15 divided data are complete. With increasing 𝑝̅o, more 
cooperative PRNs are necessary because fewer divided data 
are cached in the RNs. When we compare Figures 6(a) and (b), 
it is clear that the use of the erasure code reduces the number 
of PRNs for data retrieval. This is an advantage when it comes 
to data acquisition, even though the total amount of sensing 
data increases during data generation. Specifically, the 
method with the erasure code improves by 53.7%, 55.2%, 
53.3%, and 51.9% when 𝑝̅o  = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, 
respectively. In particular, as shown in Figure 6(b), in the case 
where 𝑝̅o < 0.05, the number of cooperative PRNs is reduced 
to 0, which means that the data request can be fully completed 
by PPRN.

C. Evaluation results: Availability 
In this section, we calculate the availability modeled in the 
previous section using computer simulations. Figure 7 shows 
a numerical example in the case where ρ = 50 (ℓ = 200) and ρ 
= 250 (ℓ = 80). These simulations were performed under three 
conditions where (a) SNs were more unreliable than RNs and 
MBS, (b) MBS and RNs were equally reliable, and (c) MBS 
was more reliable than SNs and RNs. Note that, as shown in 
(6), the overall availability can be improved in the proposed 
scheme thanks to the proxy caching scheme, i.e., the system 
uses reliable PRNs instead of unreliable SNs. As a comparable 
method, the conventional scheme was not used the proxy 
caching technique. In addition, the MBS is a single point of 
failure in the ICWSN system. 
The results are shown in Figures 7(a–c), where we can see 
that the proposed scheme improves the overall availability by 
5.93%, 14.7%, 22.1%, 31.8%, 36.6%, and 46.7% for ρ = 50 
(ℓ = 200) and 5.91%, 14.5%, 23.3%, 31.2%, 38.8%, and 
46.0% for ρ = 250 (ℓ = 80) in the case where 𝑝̅o = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 
0.15, 0.2, and 0.25, respectively. As shown in Figure 7(a), SN 
devices were inferior to those of RNs (i.e., 𝐴RN = 0.99 and 
𝐴MBS = 0.999, which was the same condition, but 𝐴SN was 
0.95 versus 0.9). In terms of overall (ICWSN system) 
availability, the conventional scheme had a difference (with 
the cases under that 𝐴SN was 0.95 versus 0.9) of 5.56%, while 
the proposed scheme experienced no degradation. 
Figure 7(b) shows the results when the availability of the 
RN and MBS is in the same condition, with a difference of 
0.91% for both the proposed and conventional schemes. This 
result, which can be explained by the relatively unreliable 
MBS driving the overall availability, indicates that the 
proposed scheme cannot ensure the overall availability of the 
MBS with low reliability. However, as shown in Figure 7(c), 
in the case where the MBS is more reliable (i.e., 𝐴MBS = 
0.9999 and 0.99999), the overall availability was only 
improved by 0.09% and 0.1% compared to the case of 𝐴MBS 
= 0.9999. Therefore, the results in Figure 7(b) suggest that the 
MBS should be more reliable than RNs and SNs, but the 
results in (c) indicate that the overall availability does not 
significantly improve even if the MBS device is over-reliable 
due to paying much cost, such as high-reliable hardware-
device development. 
D. Evaluation results: Energy consumption 
The challenge in deploying the proposed scheme is how to 
ensure a benefit in terms of energy consumption among the 
SN devices. This is because ICN has a pull-type network 
design and must always be on standby, and the blockchain 
also causes energy wastage. Figure 8 shows the computer 
simulation we ran to investigate the cumulative energy 
consumption in the conventional scheme (current application-
programming-interface-based IoT platform) and the proposed 
scheme. Note that, when the SN does not execute any process, 
we assume the conventional scheme supports a sleep state 
with deep sleep and wake-up functionalities, whereas the 
proposed scheme waits in the idle state to be ready for data 
retrieval from any other node (because of the pull-type data 
acquisition). The energy consumption for each status is based 
on the actual measured values from our previous study [5].  
As shown in Figure 8(a), the proposed scheme can reduce 
energy consumption by 1.91% if there are no additional 
requests for data retrieval in most cases of periodic data 
collection in ordinary situations. Moreover, even if 66 
additional data retrievals per day are requested, the proposed 
scheme can outperform. Next, Figure 8(b) shows the total 
energy consumption in the ICWSN for 1,000 SNs, with the 
results converted into the power consumption per node. For 
these results, the number of data retrieval attempts for each

condintions: (a) SNs are unreliable, (b) MBS and RNs are equally 
reliable, and (c) MBS is more reliable than other nodes.

node was determined by a Poisson distribution, which is a 
more realistic calculation than the one in Figure 8(a). As we 
can see, the proposed scheme was able to reduce energy 
consumption by 3.85% and was advantageous until 138 
retrieval attempts.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section, we implemented a testbed device and 
conducted a preliminary evaluation of the network 
performance, particularly for mmWave band WLANs. Note 
that we omitted the microwave band WLAN here because it 
is widely used and its features are well-known. The testbed 
here demonstrates a part of sensing-data processing and 
wireless communications for SN, RN, or PRN. Namely, the 
device will be able to perform the baseline tests for future test 
field construction and sensor node implementations. The 
testbed was implemented using an Advantech [11] AIR-020X 
(Six-core ARM v8.2 CPU, 8-GB RAM, Ubuntu 18.04 with 
Jet Pack OS), which is embedded in equipment for industrial 
use and adheres to the form factor of the NVIDIA Jetson; thus, 
the software and settings can be easily moved from any other 
prototype platform. The AIR-020X is high-performance for 
rich 3D sensing data, and we integrated it here with peripheral 
devices into a rectangular attaché case as a portable unit, as 
shown in Figure 9. The portable testbed device includes an 
IoT router, which is used to connect to the Internet via the 
cellular network for external time synchronization and 
emergency external control. The electrical power can be 
supplied from a wall outlet, through the devices can also 
alternatively be provided from the internal power-supply hub 
as well as the USB type A and C connections. 
For the mmWave distribution networks, we utilized a pair 
of TGs consisting of distribution nodes (DNs) and client nodes 
(CNs), the specifications of which are listed in Table I. The 
TG was designed to construct a wireless mesh network. In 
particular, the DNs work and provide a backhaul wireless 
network, while the CNs can provide broadband wireless 
communications to the end users. In this paper, we evaluate 
the fundamental characteristics of mmWave communications, 
i.e., the link between the DN at the end of the backhaul 
network and the CN to the user terminal. Note that the 
hardware equipment for demonstrating the link between CN 
and 
DN 
and 
between 
DNs 
is 
different 
wireless 
communication equipment. However, we believe there is no 
significant 
difference 
in 
wireless 
communication 
characteristics. 
According to the TG specification [9], a DN provides a 
mesh network among DNs within 15 hops and is composed of 
multiple sectors capable of communication in different 
directions. A CN is typically a one-sector station node that 
terminates Internet protocol (IP) connectivity for an end-user. 
The communication protocol between a DN and CN 
corresponds to the model of access point to station node in 
IEEE 802.11 ad/ay. To determine the best beam angle for the 
best SNR, TG has features of periodic beamforming and 
interference measurement. The MCS set is a combination of a 
modulation method (specifically BPSK, QPSK, or 16-QAM) 
and the low-density parity check coding scheme (with code 
rates of 1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 13/16, and 7/8). TG supports a total of 
12 MCSs and typically operates at MCS nos. #12 and #9 (as

shown in Table I) for 250-m-range coverage and achieves a 
throughput of 1 Gbit/s.  
In the experiment, the network nodes are constructed using 
the implemented portable device and a 13-in MacBook Air. 
The TG equipment was mounted on a tripod, and both were 
respectively connected to the subscriber- and publisher-side 
devices. The horizontal plane of a DN and CN was maintained 
using a laser telemeter and the distance between the two nodes 
was measured at the same time. 
This experiment 
was conducted 
in 
an outdoor 
environment, as shown in Figure 9, and there were no objects 
to interrupt the radio route, although some of the surrounding 
buildings caused reflections. The radio propagation was 
dominated by line-of-sight and building-reflected paths. 
Figure 10 shows the experimental results, including 
throughput at the transmission control protocol (TCP) layer 
using iPerf3, a common tool for measuring TCP throughput, 
and the ICN layer using Cefore [12], a CCNx-based ICN 
platform. Note that, when the proxy caching scheme is used, 
there might be a problem of cache inconsistency. In Cefore, 
the caching data can be managed using database in the daemon 
process of csmgrd and this concern is not present. As we can 
see, there was no significant throughput degradation 
depending on the distance between TGs, unlike that seen with 
IEEE 802.11 standards in Sub-6-GHz bands. In this 
experiment, we remove the reasons for the degradation of 
radio propagation, e.g., radio attenuation by trees and foliage, 
blocking materials (vehicle and human) between antennas, 
and multipath fading due to reflected waves. In addition, the 
mmWave communication must have the beamforming 
technique to bolster strong straightness with w signal 
weakness. In fact, the throughput was reduced by up to 50% 
when a person crosses between nodes, and throughput was 
reduced by up to 10% when the horizontal plane was not flat. 
Since the mmWave band is highly directional (i.e., it has 
a radio-propagation characteristic similar to that of light), we 
investigated the degree to which it can be tolerated once a 
communication path between antennas was established by a 
beamforming technique. The DN and CN were placed three 
meters apart from each other, and we conducted the 
experiment in an electromagnetic anechoic chamber that is a 
shielded to eliminate the effect of other radio signals, 
including the reflected waves themselves. The DN and CN 
were maintained on a horizontal axis (determined using a laser 
telemeter), and the TCP and ICN throughputs were measured 
when the DN was fixed and the CN was moved to change its 
angle, as shown in Figure 12. The results showed that the 
wireless communication was stable and maintained even if the 
angle between CN and DN was changed several times. Note 
that, in our latest study [13], we develop and evaluate the 
testbed devices and test fields to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the proposed scheme for real WSN implementations.

standardized ETSI ZSM reference architecture to enable 
network administrators to understand real-time automated 
tasks in a 5G network without human intervention. Boškov et 
al. [15] proposed a zero-touch solution based on WLAN and 
Bluetooth technologies that can yield a sufficient performance 
for provisioning multiple devices without depending on the 
vendor's proprietary hardware and software. For resource 
management among nodes including an extended capability 
regarding 5G network slicing services, Theodorou et al. [16] 
formed marketplaces to facilitate the exchange service level 
agreements, where a blockchain was utilized for guaranteeing 
an untrusted and unreliable node. 
For μO and μSP, Togou et al. [17] introduced a distributed 
blockchain-enabled network slicing framework that enables 
service and resource providers to dynamically lease resources, 
thereby ensuring high performances for their end-to-end 
services. The key component of the framework is its global 
service provisioning, which provides admission control for 
incoming service requests along with dynamic resource 
assignment by means of a blockchain-based bidding system. 
This is essentially a blockchain-based multi-operator service 
provisioning for 5G users with Intra and Inter spectrum 
management among multiple telecom operators. Gorla et 
al. [18] presented a blockchain-based implementation model 
for spectrum sharing between operators to minimize spectrum 
under-utilization in order to enable reliable quality of services. 
Another study [19] has suggested that the network slice 
provider will play the role of an intermediate entity between 
the vertical service provider and the resource provider, which 
makes a shift from a network-operator-oriented business to a 
more open system with multiple actors. Today, management 
and orchestration are considered prime components of the 
new network management layer [20], and multi-domain 
orchestration has helped in simplifying infrastructural 
operations while enabling better scaling and faster 
deployment of network services. Based on multi-constraint 
QoS, it fulfills the E2E slice request. Blockchain is also 
deployed to ensure trustworthiness between different telecom 
operators, introduce transparency, and automate the 
fulfillment of service-level agreements through smart 
contracts. 
For mmWave-band communication systems, Rappaport, 
et al. [21] presented path loss models with directional and 
omnidirectional antennas based on over 15,000 measured 
power delay profiles (PDPs) at 28, 38, 60, and 73 GHz bands 
using wideband channel sounders. Tariq, et al. [22] measured 
received signal strength and delay spread values for each 
specified beam combination with massive antenna arrays in 
both indoor and outdoor scenarios using TG radios. Shkel, et 
al. [23] presented TG platform for promoting the research in 
mmWave propagation, systems, and networks. Aslam, et 
al. [24] measured the radio propagation characteristics for in-
street backhaul environments and evaluated along with lay-
based simulations. The results indicated that path loss in the 
urban canyon scenario was observed to be smaller when 
compared with the residential areas due to the rich number of 
multipath components. All these studies indicate that 
mmWave features a high path loss and a high material 
attenuation. 
Sellami, et al. [25] proposed to implement an architecture 
for a distributed fog caching solution for ICN system, which 
consisted of sensor sub-networks connected to one or more 
fog super-nodes that maintained the internal caching policies 
and interactions with the fog in order to achieve efficient 
content caching and retrieval. Sukjaimuk, et al. [26] proposed 
an effective caching and forwarding algorithm for congestion 
control for ICWSN. The scheme utilized accumulative 
popularity-based delay transmission time for forwarding 
strategy and included the consecutive chunks-based segment 
caching scheme. Zhang, et al. [27] leveraged the machine 
learning technology to propose an intelligent caching scheme 
that could automatically adjust the caching nodes’ caching 
parameters for the dynamic network environments. The 
simulation results showed that the scheme outperformed the 
existing approaches in terms of the total energy consumption. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a zero-touch-design ICWSN to 
promote self-growing and ensure a reliable sensing-data 
distribution in which multiple players actively participate and 
exchange data. A computer simulation was conducted using a 
testbed of the proposed scheme and TG to investigate the 
conditions under which it can best perform, its overall 
availability, and its energy consumption, as the potential waste 
involved in the use of ICN and blockchain is significant. The 
results demonstrated the feasibility of our scheme and 
clarified the radio-propagation characteristics of mmWave 
band WLANs. In our ongoing research project, which we call 
the Decentralized Digital Twins’ Ecosystem (D2EcoSys), we 
will further investigate the deployment of this scheme for real 
smart cities, which is our future work.
