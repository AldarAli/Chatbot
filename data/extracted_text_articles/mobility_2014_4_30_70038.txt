Fig. 1 shows the result of experiments that have been 
performed using a real terminal and applications to frame the 
issue of application session continuity. The terminal was 
equipped with two network interfaces accessing independent 
networks. For each test, the application was started on NetA, 
then Net A was disabled and NetB started with different 
delays, as shown in the figure. We could observe that, while 
some of the popular user applications tested are able to 
recover by themselves thanks to their smart design, others 
are frozen or completely stopped, as shown with an infinite 
time recovery on the right of the figure. 
So, the primary objective of this paper is to tackle the 
problem of the session failure when changing to an access 
network that does not support mobility. The result will allow 
an individual using a mobile device to roam seamlessly 
across non-federated heterogeneous wireless environments. 
Such environments can be a mobile operator network, a 
campus hotspot, a road operator communication network or 
the user private home network.  
Several 
networking 
techniques 
such 
as 
Media 
Independent Services, mobility management, or autonomous 
systems can contribute to achieve our objective, but none of 
them provides the solution on its own. By enhancing and 
combining efficiently these mechanisms, the target scheme 
involves a strong level of cross-layer design and enables 
many generic services such as handovers, broadcast services, 
session mobility, battery saving or security.  
In this contribution, we propose an innovative framework 
to resolve at MT level the problem of session continuity 
between independent domains and leave the network totally 
unaffected. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. 
Section II discusses the existing technologies available to 
address this type of issue, analysing their potential 
contributions to an integrated framework and their 
limitations. After this, in Section III, we propose our 
integrated framework and describe its internal components. 
This is followed in Section IV by its evaluation with a 
simulation model implementing the proposed system, and 
includes its main results. The document is closed in Section 
V with an assessment of the contribution and the indication 
of direction for future research topics.  
II. 
ANALYSING EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES  
In this section, the existing technologies and challenges 
lying in the path of the target architecture are identified and 
reviewed.  
A. Media Independent Services 
Operating multimode devices in heterogeneous networks 
can become very complex if each access technology has to 
be controlled directly and separately by the upper layer 
entities. This has led to the emergence of a strategy based on 
a shared abstraction layer above the access layer. In this 
direction, the IEEE 802.21 standard proposes three different 
Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services [1], which 
offer to the upper layer management protocols some generic 
triggers, information acquisition and the tools needed to 
perform handovers. The Event Service (MIES) provides the 
framework needed to manage the classification, filtering and 
triggering of network events, and to report dynamically the 
status of the different links. The Command Service (MICS) 
allows the upper layer management entities to control the 
behaviour of the links. The Information Service (MIIS) is 
distributes the topology-related information and policies 
from a repository located in the network. They result in a 
cross-layer architecture where the Media Independent 
Handover Function (MIHF) operates as a relay between the 
media-specific Link layer entities and the media-agnostic 
upper layer entities, or MIH-Users. In existing solutions, the 
MIH-User is represented by a Connection Manager (CMGR) 
whose main role is to decide which path if best suited to 
reach the application server or the Correspondent Node (CN) 
located across the Internet [2]. 
Currently, the IEEE 802.21 standard provides valuable 
mechanisms to control the network interfaces of a multimode 
terminal in a media-independent and abstracted way. 
However, it involves a few strong limitations. It currently 
only enables handover services and deals exclusively with 
the control of wireless network interfaces. It does not 
consider the information from other devices, such as battery 
consumption or positioning, in the terminal. It thus offers the 
possibility to be developed to support an extended set of 
services and devices in the terminal. This extension will be a 
main axis for the design of the target solution. 
B. Handling Mobility 
The most recent mobile devices are expected to be usable 
while walking on the streets, carried in road vehicles or even 
in fast speed trains. However, when a device moves out of its 
original routing area, it cannot continue using the same IP 
address and the executing session is broken. Incoming 
packets are still forwarded along the former route and are not 
able to reach the mobile anymore. To solve this problem, the 
IETF groups address the issue of mobility at various levels of 
the protocol stack. The solution coverage is wide spread as 
well: at device, transport, session, application, or even more 
recently, at flow level. The objective is to design protocols 
able to survive the change of the terminal environment 
context or discontinuities of its connectivity. A large set of 
mechanisms and protocols has been proposed to solve this 
issue. Mobile IP and its enhancements, Fast Mobile IP or 
Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP), operate at the network layer level. 
Other protocols like mobile Stream Control Transmission 
Protocol (mSCTP) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
address the transport layer level or above [3]. All these 
solutions thus affect the network or transport layer. They 
depend on control entities located in the network that must 
be owned and maintained by specific organizations. They 
most often infer heavy changes to the network architecture, 
including in the anchor point, or to the communication 
interface at the application, and thus face strong 
unwillingness for their deployment. For their part, the 
cellular systems handle mobility with 3rd Generation 
Partnership Project (3GPP) proprietary protocols and 
procedures [4], sometimes adapted from the previous ones.  
Beside these continuous mechanisms, an interesting 
technique named Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) allows the 
mobile nodes to survive long connectivity disruptions.

MOBILITY 2014 : The Fourth International Conference on Mobile Services, Resources, and Users

A. Shared Knowledge 
Implementing the first CCF concept, the CLA gathers the 
data from the devices and Link Layer technologies and from 
the upper layers, aggregates them in the LIB and provides 
them on request when needed to the other CCF components.  
The cross-layer approach adopted here is a hybrid of two 
common solutions, in order to integrate their benefits. A 
cross-layer engine, the CLA, is introduced that works as a 
local Information Server. It manages a local storage, the LIB, 
making it accessible to the other components in the 
framework, namely the MISF and the sub-components of the 
CA, while preserving its integrity. In parallel, direct 
interactions between the adjacent components (CM, GSEs, 
MISF, and Link Interfaces) are maintained to transfer related 
events and commands, according to the layered model. This 
scheme distributes the complexity and ensures a quick 
response of the overall framework to changes in the external 
environment. 
The LIB is the shared knowledge source for the whole 
system. It contains all the data relevant for an optimized 
operation of the framework. These data are classified in three 
types: (i) pre-defined information stored at configuration 
time, either by the user or by accessing remote databases at 
the network operator servers (e.g., MIIS) or in the cloud, (ii) 
status information about the mobile and its environment 
reported by the other CCF components, (iii) policies and 
utility functions resulting from the learning process. 
B. Device Abstraction 
The MISF is an enhanced abstraction layer responsible 
for dealing with the wireless multimodality of the terminal. It 
is a key component of the connectivity optimization process, 
as it also provides the means for the abstracted interaction 
between the radio access and the upper layers. It is based on 
the IEEE 802.21 MIH model, keeping only its local 
components, but is not restricted to handover; it fully 
manages the wireless accesses and the other devices in the 
terminal, hiding their specificities to the upper layers. It 
provides a whole set of additional services, including system 
statistics and status retrieving, resource configuration to 
comply with a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS), 
setting and getting identities, handling power sources, 
positioning, etc. Moreover, it also provides an abstract 
interface to the CLA component, directly forwarding to the 
local storage the network or device information received, and 
contributing to the system learning. The MISF is later able to 
retrieve the link parameters when requested to issue a 
command to the lower layers, avoiding that the upper layers 
get involved with the device details. 
The Link Interface components make the link between 
the MISF and the technology drivers. There is one Link 
Interface per type of device, completely specific to its 
implementation. Its main function is to translate the MIS 
commands and forward them to their target destination. It 
acts as the endpoint for parameters retrieval from the device. 
Its location at the edge of the CCF minimizes the overall 
energy and processing power consumed by the framework. 
Before generating events, it smooths the values of retrieved 
dynamic parameters and applies hysteresis thresholds to 
avoid unnecessary and too frequent reactions. When related 
to the mobile connectivity, internal devices (positioning 
systems, power supplies or other sensors) can be integrated 
and coordinated through the CCF and the MISF, provided 
the availability of a Link Interface component that translates 
the abstract MIS primitives into the corresponding set of 
commands.  
C. Coordinated Generic Service Enablers 
The Generic Service Enablers, or GSEs, are the key 
elements of this framework. They allow the legacy services 
to benefit from the technology-agnostic framework. They 
complement at service level the abstraction introduced by the 
MISF. These functional blocks are called generic because 
each of them provides a set of specialized functionalities; 
they take care of the specificities of the applications and 
legacy Network Services (NS). They act as MIS-Users and 
hide the MISF interface to their own users. They can query 
the LIB for aggregated relevant cross-layer metrics and to 
provide them to the upper layer services.  
 
The NAGSE deals with aspects related to the monitoring 
of the networks availability, learning the characteristics of 
the unknown accesses and selecting the best access network 
by running its algorithm on a set of parameters retrieved 
from the CLA. The reader is referred to [8] for more details 
on its functionality. 
 
The MGSE is the most commonly developed part of the 
CA. Its role is generally included in the CMGR. It takes care 
of connectivity related services, including network interfaces 
and link management, networking aspects, reception and 
filtering of network and device events, keeping track of 
current location and connectivity. The MGSE enables the 
capability to be connected to different types of networks 
using abstracted processes and mechanisms. Moreover, it 
smartly filters and dynamically reports changes of the MT 
context, whether internal or in the external network 
environment. The process of the MGSE is completely 
independent from the existing mobility protocols, such as 
Mobile IP, that may be available in the network and/or the 
terminal and would run as part of the NS. It thus provides an 
enhancement to these mechanisms. 
 
The SGSE deals with aspects related to the management 
of the data sessions opened by the applications. It also takes 
care of the availability of resources according to the 
application QoS requirements. For each user application, two 
related addresses are used. A Personal Address (PA) is 
attributed to the application when it starts. This address is 
kept identical throughout the whole session [9]. The Local IP 
Address (LA) depends on the user network location. It is the 
global address seen by the external network nodes. In case 
Mobile IP is used, the LA is equal to the Care of Address 
(CoA). In the data plane, the SGSE performs the address 
translation between the PA seen by the application and the 
LA seen by the network. As will be demonstrated in the 
validation part in Section IV, this action has a very low 
impact of the performance of the whole system. For the

coordinated generic service enablers responsible of dedicated 
tasks and taking care of the various functions necessary to 
handle the terminal connectivity. To assess its benefits, a 
simulation model has been developed, that compares the 
framework 
behaviours 
in 
a 
testing 
heterogeneous 
environment to other solutions that do not affect the network. 
The concept of keeping the changes in the mobile device 
distributes the effort in the global system, reduces the risk of 
bottleneck functions in the network and improves its 
scalability. No additional network entity has to be deployed 
and maintained by the operators, the system installation and 
configuration are simplified. This study has investigated 
comprehensively the distribution of functions and the 
integration and coordination of the system proposed. For 
each individual component, existing solutions that satisfied 
the main requirements have been selected and necessary 
enhancements described. A future continuation of this topic 
will perform a more precise analysis and definition of the 
generic service enablers introduced in the CCF.
