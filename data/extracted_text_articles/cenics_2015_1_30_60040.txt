Abstract— In this paper, a general method is proposed to 
design patch antenna with high gain in the Ku band. The 
design method is illustrated with the help of two examples. It is 
shown that high gain antennas can be designed with 
satisfactory performance in the desired band. The designed 
antennas can be used in the applications relating to the Ku-
band such as satellite communication, radar, point to point 
communication etc.  
Keywords- Antenna radiation patterns; patch antenna; high 
gain antenna. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The patch antennas have been studied rigorously and 
widely since last three decades. This class of antenna offers 
various advantages as low cost, light weight, easy fabrication 
and conformability etc but on the other hand these antennas 
have narrow bandwidth and low gain [1]. Various 
approaches have been used to overcome the problems of 
narrow bandwidth and low gain [2]. Recently the authors 
have proposed use of partial Koch to improve the gain of 
triangular patch antenna [3]. Similarly star shaped patch 
antenna has been designed to overcome the problem of low 
gain at higher order modes in the Ku band [4][5]. The design 
of star shaped antenna in [4][5] has been generalized in this 
paper and guidelines have been provided for the design 
procedure at any frequency in the Ku-band. Furthermore 
slots usage to improve antenna performance is also discussed 
by the authors in [6]. This paper generalizes the design 
procedure of [4]-[6] to design a single layer patch to achieve 
high gain at higher order modes without having to resort to 
air gaps, parasitic patches, superstrates, staked patches or 
arrays etc. The design guidelines have been verified by 
designing two antennas in band of 16GHz-16.3GHz [4]-[6] 
and 24GHz-24.25GHz. These two frequency bands have 
been selected for their usage in practical applications like 
point to point communication, radar, amateur radio, 
radiolocation services etc and the growing trend towards the 
usage of higher microwave frequencies. The paper is 
organized as follow: In Section 2 existing literature on the 
high gain antennas is presented. Section 3 presents the 
proposed method guidelines, Section 4 presents design 
example based on the proposed method. The discussion on 
the design is presented in Section 5 while conclusion is 
drawn in Section 6.  
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
The low gain problem is tackled by different techniques. 
These techniques can be broadly classified into five 
categories. 1) Use of Substrates-Superstrates 2) Use of 
Stacked/Parasitic patches 3) Lossless feeding Techniques 4) 
and Higher order mode Excitation. Among these categories 
2 and 3 were initially used to tackle bandwidth problem but 
later these were also used for gain enhancement. Nicolaos et 
al. [7][8] presented the resonance conditions for a substrate-
superstrate printed antenna geometry for high gain. K.F.Lee 
et al. [9] have used same size parasitic elements to achieve 
high gain apart from bandwidth. Parasitic elements obtain 
energies from fed by near field coupling and function as 
radiating element in an array. Along with the parasitic 
elements concept the stacked elements concept [10] is used 
to achieve high gain. L-probe feed [11] has been shown to 
increase the bandwidth and gain of the fed patch. The L-
probe acts as a series resonant element with resonant 
frequency close to the dominant mode thereby increasing 
the gain of the patch. The higher order modes in case of 
patch antennas however are discussed very little to increase 
gain. This is due to the difficultly and challenge associated 
with the excitation of higher order modes in given 
dimensions of the patch. Furthermore high side lobe levels, 
undesirable radiation patterns and narrow impedance 
bandwidth are associated with higher order modes [1]. The 
star shape antenna thus designed alleviates this problem and 
hence facilitates the antenna design without having to resort 
to complex and thick designs.

where L is the length of square patch. Using equ (1) one 
can simply finds out the dimension L by plugging in the 
mode numbers m n, frequency desired (this is f70) and 
relative dielectric constant and then by using calculated 
dimension L the dominant mode frequency can be found 
easily for the initial design. This is explained by two 
examples: Example 1: (Frequency = 16GHz, dielectric 
constant = 2.33 and m=7, n=0) the dimension L comes out to 
be 42.12mm. Putting L = 42.12mm and the dominant mode 
m = 1, n = 0, the frequency is found to be 2.4GHz for 
dielectric constant of 2.33. Similarly for Example 2: 
(Frequency = 24GHz, dielectric constant = 2.33 and m=7, 
n=0) L is found to be 28.6mm and frequency at dominant 
mode is 3.4 GHz. These calculations are summarized in 
Table 1.

The dominant mode frequencies calculated are to be used 
for initial design of square patch [1] which when undergoes 
the surface modification [4]-[6] resonates at f70 frequency. 
The initial antenna design [4], its improvement [6] have been 
reported by the authors however the design procedure was 
not generalized in [4]-[6]. Here we present the general design 
guide lines of the design. Following are the designs 
guidelines  
1. Using above listed method calculate the dominant 
frequency from the desired frequency f70. 
2. Design square patch at the dominant frequency with 
side length L [1]. 
3. Cut squares of side L/4 from four edges of the 
designed square patch in 2 resulting in the cross 
shaped antenna [4]. 
4. Cut L/2 equilateral triangles from center of cross 
shaped antenna to result in star shaped antenna [4]. 
These guidelines have been shown in fig.1 (left). 
IV. 
EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE DESIGN PROCEDURE AND 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
Example 1 can be seen in [4][5] where the simulated and 
measured results are discussed. Here as an Example 2 the 
square patch is designed at 3.4GHz with substrate RT 
DURIOD 5870 having relative permittivity of 2.33 and 
height h = 1.5mm as calculated in Table 1. The antenna is 
fed with coaxial probe. The design of 24GHz star antenna 
follows the guidelines listed above. The final design is 
shown in Fig. 1(right) along with its S11 parameter and 
radiation patterns at 24GHz in Fig 2(left) and Fig. 2(right) 
respectively. The simulated gain at 24GHz is found to be 
12.9dBi. The other resonant modes in fig.2 (left) can be 
suppressed by use of suitable slots [6] which will eventually 
enhance the antenna performance. 
 
V. 
DISCUSSION AND EXPLANATION OF HIGH GAIN 
For the same size antenna, increasing the frequency will 
decrease the wavelength hence the gain of the antenna will 
increase. This can be verified through equ. (2) [1]

A basic square patch can be viewed as a two element 
array, consisting of two radiating edges of length 
λ / 2
 and 
separated by a distance 
λ / 2
 [6]. In case of square shaped 
antenna resonated at f70 frequency, the distance between the 
radiating edges become greater then  
λ / 2
, however when 
the surface modification is done leading to star shaped 
antenna the distance decreases hence surface current 
densities become favorably in phase leading to high gain 
[6]. The Microstrip patch antennas have been studied 
extensively in last three decades to alleviate the problems of 
low gain and narrow bandwidth. However, the higher order 
modes of the patch antennas are not discussed significantly 
due to difficulty in their excitation and deteriorated 
performance associated with them. This approach of surface 
modification leading to star shape patch antenna provides 
the method to excite the higher order modes properly. 
Furthermore, the performance of antenna is highly improved 
in terms of gain, radiation patterns and bandwidth. Thus the 
design procedure facilitates the design of high gain patch 
antenna at higher frequencies by utilizing higher order 
modes without resorting to complex designs and techniques 
already reported in the literature. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The paper presents a generalized method to design a high 
gain patch antenna suitable for the applications relating to 
the Ku-band. The method is verified through two design 
examples. The performance of the designed antennas can be 
further improved by use of suitable slots. The proposed 
method alleviates the problems associated with higher order 
modes such unstable radiation patterns, high SLLs etc. The 
method provides the procedure through surface modification 
of the patch to excite higher order modes in the patch and 
hence achieve high gain without complex designs.
