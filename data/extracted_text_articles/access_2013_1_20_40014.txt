Abstract - This article deals with a choice of voice payload size 
and its impact on the behavior of the field network of the 
Armed Forces of the Czech Republic. The contradictory 
requirements for a high throughput and at the same time a 
high quality of transmitted voice are discussed. First, a 
theoretical analysis of the problem is carried out. The 
theoretical assumptions were compared with those obtained in 
experiments in laboratory conditions. The result of the 
experiments is to determine the optimal size of the voice 
payload size with regard to the specific characteristics and 
requirements on the battlefield. According to the results we 
can recommend an optimal voice payload size with respect to 
the G.114 Recommendation. Thus up to 80 % of bandwidth 
saving will be achieved.

 INTRODUCTION  
The Army of the Czech Republic has recently completed 
modernization of communication infrastructure of the field 
network. According to current trends in the world 
communications, the backbone of battlefield is based on the 
transmission of information using the IP protocol, published 
by Postel [1]. After overcoming primary difficulties, the 
modernization brought a stable network enabling the use of a 
number of new advanced services. A major benefit of the 
field network modernization with regard to its specific 
character is a possibility of an easy and secure encryption of 
a data and voice traffic. The basic building components of 
the backbone are Cisco 2800 and 3800 series routers that use 
the services of Cisco CallManager Express (CCME) [2] for 
the providing of voice services on the VoIP principles. 
Particular communication nodes are connected by radiorelay 
links realizing the E1 interface [3]. 
With 
today's 
technical 
possibilities 
of 
digitized 
battlefield, a bigger focus is getting on the network 
bandwidth. In addition, a number of applications require a 
real-time operation. With regard to this trend, the E1 
interface with a capacity of 2 Mb/s represents a weak point 
of the network. Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution to 
make the transmission of the required information more 
efficient. 
There are many possibilities on how to solve the problem 
always with regard to the specifics of the analyzed network. 
Choudhury and Gibson [4] deal with the issue of 
effectiveness of multimedia transport in wireless access 
networks. Specifically, the work deals with the possibility of 
optimizing the efficiency of transmission, depending on the 
choice of transmission rate and payload length in IEEE 
802.11 network. Bhanu, Chandrasekaran, and Balakrishnan 
[5] solve security of the required quality of services in VoIP 
802.11 environment. A Bandwidth Data rate Moderation 
(BDM) algorithm has been proposed which correlates the 
data rate specified in IEEE 802.11b with the free bandwidth. 
Payload size is one of the input parameters of the BDM 
algorithm. The way to make the data transfer at a tactical 
command level more efficient by a header compression 
technique is addressed in the article of Yoon, Park, Lee, 
Kim, and Jee [6]. Nowadays, modern VoIP networks place 
attention to safety issues and therefore the voice encryption. 
Epiphaniou [7] addresses among others the influence of the 
used encryption and voice payload size on the delay and 
packet loss. All considered changes need to be addressed 
with regard to the required voice quality. For example, the 
voice quality expressed in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) in 
dependence on voice payload size and packet loss is engaged 
in the publication of Becvar, Vondra, and Novak [8].  
Unlike those publications, we examine specific real 
network with sufficiently dimensioned HardWare (HW) 
because of increased requirements on network reliability. We 
need not, therefore, deal with the impact of packet loss on 
speech quality. In addition, the network uses external 
encryption equipment with sufficient packet throughput. 
These facts allow us to simplify the initial conditions for the 
experiments.  
The weak point of the analyzed network are the 
radiorelay links realizing the E1 interface. So, the main goal 
of our work is to optimize efficiency of transmission of VoIP 
data on E1 links. Furthermore, we use the fact that the E1 
interface uses specific data link layer protocols different 
from the protocols considered in the above publications.  
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, 
we present factors affecting the level of savings in 
bandwidth. In Section 3, there is explained a principle of 
bandwidth calculation for one call in VoIP environment 
when voice payload size is explored. In Section 4, results of 
voice payload size optimization in battlefield conditions are 
shown. In Section 5, we outline our conclusions and we 
mention our future work.

II. 
FACTORS AFFECTING THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS IN 
BANDWIDTH 
Nowadays, there are many views how to optimally solve 
existence of two contradictory requirements on the most 
efficient use of bandwidth on one hand, and, on the other 
hand, provision of the high quality voice in the VoIP 
environment. The rule is that a codec type significantly 
affects the quality of provided services and the required 
bandwidth. Its parameters, such as a codec sample interval 
(CSI), a codec sample size (CSS), are given the same as a 
value of Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for the default type of 
codec. Based on the codec, CSI is a sample interval at which 
the codec operates and CSS is the number of bytes captured 
by the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) at each codec sample 
interval. From these two parameters, we can derive another 
parameter. It is a codec bit rate (CBR) (1) 
 
CBR = CSS / CSI  [b/s]. 
(1) 
MOS is a result of subjective or objective methods of 
speech quality assessment as Bestak, Vranova, and Ondryhal 
refer [9]. Its values and interpretation are shown in Table 1. 
TABLE I.

Good 
Quality comparable to analogue phone networks 
3 
Fair 
Fair speech quality 
2 
Poor 
Poor speech quality 
1 
Bad 
Unintelligiblecall 
 
If we use two of the most common codec types, thus 
G.711 and G.729 codecs, the MOS can reach values up to 
4.1 and 3.9.  
Note: Due to complexity of nowadays networks, the 
MOS parameter is no longer sufficient and has been replaced 
by R-factor, which is more suitable for IP networks. The R-
factor is the output of the E-model (according to ITU-T 
G.107). 
In the next step, it is needed to consider a possibility of 
application of header compression mechanisms or Voice 
Activity Detection (VAD) techniques. Header compression 
is possible only when the point-to-point communication 
occurs. By default, the use of the efficient compression of 
IP/UDP/RTP headers is used according to Casner and  
Jacobson in RFC 2508 [10] and Bormann, et al. in RFC 3095 
[11]. It reduces the headers up to 2 or 4 bytes. It is not 
suitable to use this mechanism directly over the Ethernet. 
However, we can use encapsulation using a Point-to-Point 
Protocol (PPP) according to Simpson [12]. PPP provides 
standard services for transmission of different formats of 
datagrams through serial lines (RFC 1661). PPP is one of the 
Layer 2 protocols which can also compress the headers in 
some cases. 
VAD is a mechanism that certainly saves bandwidth. 
However at the same time, it places greater demands on 
implementation in the terminal equipment. In many cases, 
the active VAD can result in losses of beginnings of call 
segments, which greatly decrease quality of voice services. 
For more complex services, the VAD implementation can 
even bring errors and cause problems with operation of more 
complex services. We had such specific experience when we 
deployed faxes in the field VoIP network.  
Another factor that must be considered when optimizing 
the size of the payload is loading of a router. A large number 
of short packets are right for real-time applications with 
respect to small delay but it increases an overhead and 
computational demands imposed on the routers. A large 
number of shorter packets and necessity of their processing 
in nodes paradoxically leads gradually to an increase of the 
total delay in transmission, in the next step to packet losses 
and thus to further deterioration of the voice quality and to 
the flooding of the nodes and a link failure. 
Other parameters describing transmission conditions in 
the particular VoIP network are Voice Payload Size (VPS) 
(By), Voice Payload Interval (VPI) (ms) and Packets Per 
Seconds (PPS). The voice payload size represents the 
number of bytes (or bits) that are filled into a packet. The 
voice payload size must be a multiple of the codec sample 
size. The voice payload interval is processed length of a 
voice segment inserted into one sent packet. PPS represents 
the number of packets that need to be transmitted every 
second in order to deliver the codec bit rate. Just these 
parameters can be varied to optimize network throughput and 
the voice quality, respectively to look for the best 
compromise with regard to specifics of the analysed 
network. 
With regard to the facts mentioned above, there can be 
defined initial conditions for optimization of transfer 
characteristics of the analysed field network as follows: the 
mechanism of headers compression is not used, VAD is set, 
the G.729 codec is used. A computing power of routers with 
regard to the adequate field network dimensioning is not 
discussed. A weak point of the field network is the E1 lines. 
Of possible solutions, we focus on the influence of payload 
size on the behaviour of the analysed network in our work. 
We will examine effectiveness of transfer on Layer 3 with 
respect to the payload size. For now, we will not consider the 
influence of Layer 2 to which is applied the High Level Data 
Link Control (HDLC) protocol. Whether the results are 
relevant even after consideration of the characteristics of 
HDLC protocol will be verified in the next part of the 
project. 
A. Characteristics of the G.729codec 
The G.729 codecs are often deployed in VoIP networks 
in order to save the bandwidth. For example, Cisco 
technology uses them as a default set in the outgoing 
direction from the network. In order to save the bandwidth, 
the G.729 codec is also used as a default set in the analysed 
army field network. 
The G.729 codec is specified in ITU-T Recommendation 
G.729 [13]. Coding of speech is at 8 kbit/s using Conjugate 
Structure – Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (CS-
ACELP). A reduced – complex vision of the G.729 
algorithm is specified in Annex A to Rec. G.729. The speech

coding algorithms in the main body of G.729 and in G.729 
Annex A are fully interoperable with each other. An 
implementation that signals or accepts use of the G.729 
payload format may implement either G.729 or G.729A. The 
G.729 and G.729 Annex A codecs were optimized to 
represent speech with high quality where G.729 Annex A 
transmits some speech quality for an approximate 50% 
complexity reduction. For all data rates, the sampling 
frequency (and RTP timestamp clock rate) is 8000 Hz. The 
Voice Activity Detector (VAD) and the Comfort Noise 
Generator (CNG) algorithm in Annex B of G.729 are 
recommended for digital simultaneous voice and data 
application. An example of G.729 and G.729A bit packing 
according to ITU-T Recommendation G.729 is in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.   Example of G.729 and G.729A bit packing. 
 
The transmitted parameters of a G.729/G.729A are 10 
ms frame, consisting of 80 bits. The mapping of these 
parameters is given on the Figure 1. The bits of each 32-bit 
word are numbered from 0 to 31, with the most significant 
bit on the left and numbered 0. The octets (bytes) of each 
word are transmitted with the most significant octet first. 
 
III. 
CALCULATION OF ONE CALL BANDWIDTH IN VOIP 
ENVIRONMENT 
In theoretical calculations of bandwidth required for one 
call, it is necessary to know particular operating technology, 
including protocols employed in each level of the 
communication model. 
Bandwidth calculation formulas in general [14]: 
 
TPS = L2H + OH + VPS  [By], 
(2) 
 
PPS = CBR / VPS  [1/s], 
(3) 
 
Bandwidth = TPS * PPS  [b/s], 
(4) 
where: L2H 
is Layer 2 header 
TPS  
is Total Packet Size 
 
OH 
is overhead of IP/UDP/RTP headers. 
 
Since different systems differ in Layer 2 protocols the 
most frequently, an operational efficiency is evaluated at 
Layer 3. Here, we are dealing with overhead of IP/UDP/RTP 
headers. Layer 2 has often a major impact on the efficiency 
of transmission. We considered the effect of Layer 2 in the 
previous work [15], when we analysed the effect of network 
load on the voice quality. We interconnected two LAN 
networks using 2811 Cisco routers. The routers were 
connected through the Catalyst 2950 Switch via Ethernet in a 
mode of full duplex at 10 Mb/s. This link represents a critical 
point of the network because of its slow speed. We 
calculated the theoretical value of how many simultaneous 
calls can be transferred over a tested line, so we needed to 
know the bandwidth required for one call. 
In this case, we used (see Figure 2): 
• 
G.711 codec 
• 
Sampling frequency = 8000 Hz 
• 
VPI = 30 ms 
• 
VPS = 240 By 
• 
Layer 3 headers = IP header 20 By  + UDP header 8 
By + RTP header 12 By = 40By 
• 
Layer 2 (Ethernet) header = 38 By (8 By of preamble, 
14 By of the source and destination MAC addresses 
and the length, 4 By of CRC, 12 By of interframe 
gap). 
Note: Possibility of VAD usage and header compression 
is not considered. 
 
 
Figure 2.   Necessary overhead for transmissionof one 30 ms voice 
segment. 
 
According to (2), (3) and (4), we need bandwidth for 
transmission of one voice channel: 
TPS = (38 + 40 + 240) = 318 By, 
PPS = 64000 / 240 * 8 =  33.333  1/s, 
One call bandwidth = 318 * 8 * 33.333 = 84800 b/s. 
 
We get interesting results to the effectiveness of 
bandwidth usage when using the G.729 codec and the same 
VPI = 30 ms, so VPS = 30 By: 
TPS = (38 + 40 + 30) = 108 By, 
PPS = 8000 / 30 * 8 = 33.333  1/s, 
One call bandwidth = 108 * 8 * 33.333 = 28800 b/s. 
 
Thus by changing of the codec type will be saved about 
2/3 of the bandwidth with slight deterioration of the voice 
quality (measured by MOS or R - Factor). 
IV. 
RESULTS OF VOICE PAYLOAD SIZE OPTIMIZATION IN 
FIELD NETWORK CONDITIONS 
In the previous section, we set the initial conditions for 
the theoretical part and following experiments. Relations   
(2-4) allowing calculation of required bandwidth for a single

call at Layer 3 are the starting point.  VPS is one of variable 
parameters. Cisco routers allow setting of different values of 
VPS within 10 to 240 ms [10]. Figure 3 shows the 
dependence of the required bandwidth for one call with the 
G.729 codec on selected VPS. 
 
 
Figure 3.   Dependence of one call bandwidth on VPS – G.729 codec. 
 
The curves are not linear. Comparing low values of VPS 
to higher ones, it is evident that the significantly larger 
bandwidth to transfer one call is needed for low values.  
From the values of VPS = 100 ms, use efficiency of 
transmission line is almost the same. In this case, the 
required bandwidth for one call ranges around value of 11,2 
kbit/s. 
The default VPS value for Cisco equipment is VPS = 20 
ms which corresponds to the bandwidth = 24 kbit/s. Thus, an 
appropriate setup of VPS can significantly affect the level of 
use of the transmission line. 
Dependence of number of packets generated by end-
terminal on the value of VPS is shown on Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4.   Dependence of number of sent packets on VPS. 
 
Again, dependence is not linear. The VPS increase 
causes a significant reduction in the computational load of 
network nodes. As stated previously, we solve two 
contradictory requirements, saving of the bandwidth and 
minimum delay to obtain the good voice quality. It is logical 
that increase of the VPS takes effect in the increase of round 
trip delay. Round trip delay consists of the sum of the 
specific delays. VPS resize directly affects two of them and 
that packet delay and delay in buffers of end-terminals. (The 
buffers eliminate jitter.) 
The VPS increase of 10 By corresponds to the VPI 
change to 10 ms. Therefore, delay in one channel (packet 
delay and delay in buffers) is increased by 20 ms, in the loop 
by 40 ms. G.114 recommendation sets the maximum round 
trip delay = 300 ms. The increase by 40 ms for each VPS 
increase by 10 By cannot be ignored. The dependence of rise 
of round trip delay on VPS is shown on Figure 5. 
 
 
Figure 5.   Dependence of rise of round trip delay on VPS. 
 
With regard to the obtained results, we recommend 
choosing a compromise between the size of the VPS and the 
considered delay as follows: VPS = 60 By saves bandwidth 
by 80% with predictable delay in the loop = 240 ms. 
Therefore, we keep a sufficient reserve for possible increase 
of delay in the nodes and transmit delay. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
When analysing the field network, we focused on its weak 
points. One of them is the bandwidth of E1 links. Although, 
the network uses the VAD mechanism and efficient G.729 
codec to reduce the load generated by voice streams, we 
were looking for other options to streamline the voice 
traffic. We focused on verification of bandwidth depending 
on the voice payload size. From the calculations, it is clear 
that for small values of VPS, operation is very inefficient. In 
the next step, we evaluated a relation between VPS and 
round trip delay. We recommended VPS = 60 ms as the 
optimal value with respect to the G.114 Recommendation. 
Bandwidth saving up to 80 % can be done by this setting 
compared to the VPI default value = 20 ms. All 
consideration were carried out only at Layer 3 protocols.  
Since transmission protocols of the Layer 2 have a 
significant impact on efficiency, we will focus our future 
work on this issue. In particular, we will test the operation of 
the field network for HDLC and PPP protocols.
