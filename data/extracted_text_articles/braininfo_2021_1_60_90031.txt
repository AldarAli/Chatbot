Abstract— More than 80 million adults are affected by 
insufficient sleep in the United States, yet effective, drug-free 
therapies with few or no side effects are lacking. A 30-day 
open-label study was conducted, in which participants 
(n=25) reporting poor sleep (assessed via Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index) were recruited to test a novel wearable 
mechanical neuromodulation device. The device was 
designed to modulate the interoceptive system via the 
affective touch network. 86% of participants showed an 
overall improvement in sleep after 30 days of device use.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
There is growing evidence that humans are hard-wired 
for receiving and processing affective (slow, light) touch 
via unmyelinated C-Tactile Afferent neurons (CTAs). 
Neuroimaging studies have found information from CTAs 
is primarily processed in the insula cortex, not the 
somatosensory cortex where myelinated inputs are 
processed [1]. This distinction is important to note when 
considering the growing evidence in support of the 
fundamental role of the insula in interoceptive processing. 
Affective touch, in turn, is associated with feelings of 
calm, relaxation and social connectedness, all related to 
improved interoceptive regulation. 
Interoception is recognized as the processing of 
internal bodily signals such as changes in physiological 
states, via the Central Nervous System (CNS) [2][3]. 
Information is continuously exchanged through ascending 
and descending pathways between the CNS and the 
periphery, allowing for interoceptive information such as a 
change in temperature, to influence various physiological 
systems 
and 
processes, 
including 
sleep 
[3][4]. 
Furthermore, research has shown that interoceptive 
sensitivity and awareness may disrupt several processes, 
during sleep initiation and while asleep [2][3][4]. 
Dysregulated interoception, a mismatch between perceived 
and actual bodily states, is a hallmark of affective 
disorders and may be an underlying mechanism for sleep-
related disorders. In a 2016 report, an estimated 83 million 
adults in the United States suffered from insufficient sleep; 
however, few drug-free therapeutic interventions exist that 
have few side effects and are effective in treating sleep-
related disorders [7]. We developed a novel mechanical 
stimulation device, targeting the affective touch pathway, 
and thereby modulating the interoceptive system to 
improve sleep.  
The objective of this research is to develop a device 
designed to stimulate the interoceptive system via the 
affective touch pathway, and then test the technology in 
the real world, targeting symptoms associated with 
dysregulated interoception. Here, we targeted poor sleep, 
measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
[6]. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
outlines study methods, including a description of the 
participant sample and the device technology used, an 
ethics statement, participant responsibilities, and measures 
used to assess sleep quality. Section III contains the 
detailed results of the present study and Section IV closes 
out the paper with the conclusion.

METHODS 
A. Participants 
25 adults (14 females, 11 males), out of a total of 245 
screened, were enrolled in the study after meeting the 
criteria for poor sleep, measured by the PSQI (Global 
PSQI > 10). Ages ranged from 24 to 60 years old 
(mean=35).  
B. Mechanical Stimulation Device 
A simple headband with small piezoelectric actuators 
at the distal ends, seen in Figure 1, was developed to 
deliver short bursts of very low intensity, low frequency 
mechanical stimulation, targeting CTAs associated with 
the affective touch pathway. The actuators were positioned 
behind the ears, on the mastoid, for convenience.

The specific wave form was derived from a 
combination of empirical study (changes in alpha power 
pre/post stimulation in in-lab studies over 2 years) and 
known 
response 
characteristics 
of 
the 
CTA 
mechanoreceptors (low intensity, low frequency ~10 Hz).  
C. Study Procedure 
All study procedures were reviewed and approved by 
an ethical board (Solutions IRB, #: FWA00021831) [8]. 
The 25 participants who consented to the study were 
familiarized with the device, instructed in its use, and the 
device was donned by participants. A researcher, with 
feedback from the participant, reduced the intensity to the 
lowest perceivable level for that individual. Participants 
could increase/decrease the intensity throughout the 30-
day study. The device logged usage time and intensity. 
The participant then had their first 20-minute session in 
our lab to assess any side effects and ensure competence in 
using the device. They were instructed to use the device 
for 20 minutes every day, within an hour of their normal 
bedtime. In addition, participants wore a wrist device to 
track sleep (Garmin VivoSmart 4).  
D. Measures 
Changes in sleep quality were assessed via PSQI, a 1-
Item Sleep Quality Rating Scale, and the Garmin 
VivoSmart 4 wrist device. The PSQI is a self-report 
measure assessing sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-
month timeframe. The 1-Item Sleep Quality Rating Scale 
is a self-report measure utilizing a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 
represents little to no sleep at all, and 5 represents great 
sleep (no problems falling or staying asleep).  
III. 
RESULTS 
In the sample of 25 participants, 3 participants were 
excluded from analysis due to lack of compliance with the 
study protocol (i.e., device usage, completing the study). 
The following results will be reported as Mean ± 
standard deviation. 86% of compliant participants 
(n=22) reported an overall improvement in sleep, 
measured by Global PSQI scores shown in Figure 2, 
where lower scores indicate improvement in symptoms. 
Global PSQI scores improved by 43% on average (Pre: 
9.8 ± 3.0, Post: 5.2 ± 2.6).  
 
More 
specifically, 
91% 
of 
participants 
reported 
improvement in sleep quality, 77% reported falling asleep 
faster, and 68% reported a reduction in daytime 
drowsiness, shown in Figure 5, displaying average PSQI 
component scores pre and post 30 days of device use. 
Similarly, sleep hours increased 65 minutes on average 
(Pre: 6.60 ± 0.29, Post: 7.45 ± 0.45), shown in Figure 3, 
and self-reported sleep quality, shown in  
Figure 4, improved significantly (Pre: 3.71 ± 0.31, Post: 
4.25 ± 0.10). Sleep hours were assessed via a commercial 
wrist Photoplethysmography (PPG) device (Garmin 
VivoSmart 4, chosen as it was most reliable for sleep time 
in earlier studies). No devices appeared, in our 
assessment, to accurately measure sleep stages, nor is 
PPG a suitable substitute for a hypnogram.  
Subjects rated the device as simple and easy to use. 
There were no known adverse effects and some minor 
transient side-effects (headache, skin irritation) that 
subsided with use.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This is the first human study to evaluate mechanical 
stimulation of the affective touch pathway in a sleep-
disordered population.  Although the trial is small, open-
label, and used early prototypes, the results were 
significant and participants clearly thought they benefited 
from the use of the device.  A confirmatory Randomized
