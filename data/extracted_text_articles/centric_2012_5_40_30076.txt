Abstract— In this study, we propose an innovative multipor-
tal human interface (M-HI) for power assist systems (PASs).
This M-HI allows users to apply an operational force anywhere
on the PAS. Because of this, the workspace of the PAS is
extended and its end-effecter can be controlled as the user
wishes. However, when users control a PAS at an intermediate
joint, this joint does not always move in the same way as the
end-effecter does. In this paper, we consider the number of
links and degrees of freedom of a multilink manipulator. The
relation between a control point and the limit of its motion is
measured and analyzed. An operational position harmonization
method is proposed through this relation. This method enables
users to more accurately control the end-effector of a 3-link
PAS at its intermediate joint.
Keywords- Human robot interaction, User interfaces, Ma-
nipulator dynamics.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
No matter how large its workspace is, the area in which
an ordinary power assist system (PAS) can operate is limited
because of its restricted user motion space (see Fig. 1(a)). In
addition, ordinary PAS requires the user to stay close to the
target object. This situation may cause the object to catch
on the user during motion, and may lead to a collision [5].
In this paper, we propose an innovative multiportal human
interface (M-HI) [7]for PASs as a solution to these problems.
M-HI enables users to control a PAS’s end-effecter from
anywhere on the system, and applying M-HI expands the

effective workspace of a PAS, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Thus, M-HI enables a user to control the PAS’s end-effecter
beyond the limitations of the human motion space.
During the control of a PAS, the user has some sense
of the system’s motion at the operational point. However,
this motion is different from the actual end-effecter motion
because of the degrees of freedom (DOFs) between the user
and the end-effecter. Such differences are thought to affect
the maneuverability and work accuracy of PASs.
Applying M-HI, therefore, carries the risk of reducing
both maneuverability and user control sensitivity due to the
difference between the operational force direction and oper-
ational point motion. Thus, controlling a PAS autonomously
is necessary for not only tracing the user’s operational
force but also improving maneuverability. For example, in
Koyama et al.’s research of HARO (a Human-Assisting
Robot), the interference between a PAS and user caused
by the mechanical construction of the system is reduced by
using a ﬁltering interference force method [4]. Kawamoto
et al.’s HAL (Hybrid Assistive Leg)-3 [1], [3] PAS for gait
disorder rehabilitation is controlled by estimating a user’s
intention from their myoelectric activity. In contrast, master-
slave systems (MMSs) are not limited by the user’s motion
space. For example, Ishii’s ASTACO (Advanced System
with Twin Arms for Complex Operations) [2], Yokokohji’s
bilateral MMS [11] and Onal’s bilateral MMS [6] enable

the user to instinctively control the slave system by using
a master system with the same DOFs. However, to realize
such instinctive control, a high-speciﬁcation master system
is required.
For comparison, the characteristics that distinguish ordi-
nary PAS, MSS and PAS with M-HI are as follows. In the
proposed system, our M-HI technology enables the user to
control the end-effecter’s motion anywhere on the PAS and
thus expands the effective workspace.
M-HI does not require a special master system. Moreover,
by using an existing PAS and a force sensor, a system can
be realized in which the user does not get needlessly close
to target material. However, a PAS’s end-effecter and other
parts have different DOFs, and the force feedback is different
for arbitrary operational points. These factors may strongly
affect control sensitivity and accuracy. The conceptual model
of our multilink PAS with M-HI is shown in Fig. 2.
The control response may become negative if the user’s
operational force Fh and the operational point force FRn are
different. However, by following research such as Koyama
et al. and Kawamoto et al., and controlling the PAS au-
tonomously to ﬁt to each individual situation, improvement
of the PAS’s maneuverability can be expected.
B. Purpose
We focus on the mutual interference between a PAS and
user from the viewpoint of the force effect on the PAS by
the user. We thus deﬁne the force as this effective force
and experimentally analyze the relation between the user’s
operational force and operational point force.
In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of M-HI
with respect to expanding the effective workspace of a
PAS consisting of multi-DOF manipulators. An experiment
applying M-HI to a 3-dof PAS, which limits the motion to
the sagittal plane, is carried out, and the maneuverability of
this system is evaluated. Controlling from an intermediate
joint of the PAS, the motion of the control point sometimes
has interference from the operational force. In this paper,
we have two goals. Firstly, we try to measure and analyze
the interference force betwen a user and an actual PAS.
Secondly, we suggest a method to decrease the interference
force and harmonize the control point force and operational
force to improve maneuverability. We name this method ’op-
erational point motion harmonization’ (OPMH) and evaluate

In this paper, the experimental condition and fundamental
control method of M-HI are explained at next section. In
the section three, fundamental operational force measure-
ment and analysis are mentioned. In the fourth section, the
improve method against operational force interference are
proposed. In the ﬁfth section, the method is evaluated. In
the last saction, the paper is summarised.
II. APPLICATION OF M-HI TO 3-LINK PAS
A. Experimental setup
The experimental setup, PAS model and installed position
force-torque sensor are shown in Fig. 3. In this experiment,
we use a 3-link 3-DOF manipulator with the installed
force/torque sensor as a PAS on P1, P2 or P3. The PAS is
moved by an impedance control method, where the motion
is limited to the sagittal plane in this case.
B. 3-DOF PAS with impedance control
Our experimental 3-link PAS moved on impedance control
method. The position and posture of 3-link PAS rP3ref =
[x3ref, y3ref, θ3ref]T are calculated by the follow equation
:
Md2rP3ref
dt2
+ CdrP3ref
dt
= αFh
(1)
This impedance method controls the PAS’s motion by
calculating the physical reaction of a virtual solid body
[8], [10]. A user inputs an operational force and torque
Fh(Fx, Fy, τ) to the sensor attached to the PAS. The PAS’s
end-effecter motion is then calculated as the behavior of the
virtual solid body given by Eq. (1). Here, Fh is the user’s
operational force, α is the assist ratio, M is the inertial
matrix, rP3ref is the position and orientation of the virtual
solid body and C is a matrix of the system viscosities. The
impedance control model of the 3-link PAS considering the
end-effecter’s position is shown in Fig. 4. According to the
control method, the PAS’s end-effector realizes the user’s
operational force.

C. Application of M-HI for 3-link PAS
To apply M-HI, the operational force input to the end-
effecter point must be estimated from the operational force
given at an arbitrary operational point [7]. In this paper, this
estimation is simply deﬁned to make the evaluation of the
proposed method straightforward:
F∗
h
=
Fh
(2)
Thus, we treat Fh and F∗
h as being the same from the basic
viewpoint of the PAS’s base. Using F∗
h as the operational
force input to the end-effecter enables an arbitrary point
control without changing the PAS’s fundamental control
system. In the next subsection, we discuss the motion DOFs
of intermediate point control.
D. Motion limitations of arbitrary point control on a mul-
tilink system
If we wish to move the end-effecter through an arbitrary
motion, the requirements to move with the desired motion
are determined by the dimensions of the PAS’s motion
space while accounting for the solid body motion DOFs.
When the PAS’s motion space is one-dimension, the PAS
only needs 1 DOF. When the PAS’s motion space is two-
dimensional, the PAS needs 2 DOFs for position and 1
DOF for orientation. When the PAS’s motion space is three-
dimensional, the PAS’s needs 3 DOFs for position and 3
DOFs for orientation, speciﬁcally 6 DOFs in total [9]. We
deﬁne the relation between a motion DOF and joint DOF of
a PAS composed of a series of link manipulators by using
Fig. 2. If the PAS moves in three-dimensional space, greater
than 6 DOFs are required, those to realize the motion from
the PAS’s base to the user (DOFB) and those from the user
to the PAS’s end-effecter (DOFE). However, in this report,
we do not treat such a complex manipulator, but instead our
manipulator has a more limited number of DOFs. Therefore,
DOFB and DOFE in our experimental setup are not enough
to achieve free movement in three-dimensional space. In the
next section, we discuss the maneuverability of the PAS with
M-HI by considering the operational point force affect to the
user.
III. OPERATIONAL POINT INTERFERENCE FORCE
A. Deﬁnition of operational point interference force
To evaluate the maneuverability of the PAS with M-HI,
we consider the relation between the user’s operational force
Fh and the PAS’s operational point force FRn. This relation
is determined by studying the position and orientation of the
3-DOF manipulator in which the motion space is limited to
the sagittal plane. As a result, we see that the motion of the
operational point is different from that of the PAS’s end-
effecter. For example, to achieve the motion in Fig. 5 by con-
trolling the PAS from the second link end P2, the user must
move the PAS’s end-effecter position perpendicularly in the

down direction and change its rotation counterclockwise as
shown. According to Fig. 5, the operational point P2 moves
in the opposite direction to the operational force Fh. The
user has to control the PAS with a response FRn affected
by the operational point. Hence, as an intuitive control for
the PAS’s end-effecter, we apply a method that realizes an
ampliﬁed estimated operational force αF∗
h. However, this
method is considered to decrease the operational sensitivity
when the force caused by FRn differs from Fh. We deﬁne
the operational point interference force Fa through Fh and
FRn as follows:
Fa
=
FRn − Fh
(3)
B. Experimental control accuracy of PAS with M-HI
We apply M-HI to an actual PAS and measure the control
accuracy. In this experiment, we evaluate the tracking error
of the PAS’s end-effecter when controlled from an inter-
mediate joint. During each trial, the user attempts to move
the end-effecter to the target position. The user’s control of
the end-effecter motion is measured with the force/torque
sensor, which is attached to P3, P2 or P1, as shown in Fig. 3.
The user inputs operational forces in the up, down, forward
and backward directions, corresponding to rtn, (n = 1 · · · 4),
respectively, until the end-effecter position moves by 0.2 m
The user performs 10 repetitions in each direction. The target
paths are shown in Fig. 6. The evaluation criterion, the target

Here, Pe0 means intitial end-effecter positon, rtn is position
of the target path, rP3i is end-effecter position on the
coordinate of Pe0 and Ns is the total step count. According
to Eq. (4), a small value of εr indicates a small error between
the end-effecter and target paths. The experimental results
are shown in Fig.
7. Compared with P3 control, both
P1 and P2 controls have large target path tracking errors
εr. We have thus veriﬁed the decrease in control accuracy
of the PAS with M-HI. The relation between the average
interference force
¯
|Fa| and control accuracy εr is shown
in Fig. 8. Analysis of these data show that the correlation
coefﬁcient is 0.76, and we have therefore also veriﬁed the
correlation between tracking error and
¯
|Fa|. These results
infer that control accuracy improvement can be expected by
reducing the operational force interference. We now propose
a maneuverability improvement method that takes account
of this operational force interference.
IV. OPERATIONAL POINT MOTION HARMONIZATION
We propose a method to reduce the interference force
interference and to harmonize this force and the operational
position. We term this method “operational point motion
harmonization control (OPMH)”. OPMH has two goals;
ﬁrstly, to reduce the interference force on the operational
point, and secondly, to minimize the end-effecter motion
error. A schematic of the OPMH control algorithm is shown
in Fig. 9, and the operational force interference reduction
algorithm is shown in Fig. 11. Here, the difference Fa is
thought of as the correction force of the operational point
motion that must be added alongside FRn. If the operational
point moves due to the combination of the correction force

and FRn, then the motion is the same as that due to Fh.
However, the end-effecter motion will be different from that
calculated by the impedance control method. For example,
if 3 DOF PAS with M-HI as seen Fig. 10 controlled P2
following the operational force Fh, P3 motion has some
errors compared with the motion calculated by impedance
model. Therefore, we deﬁne the product of the correction
force and β as the OPMH force βFa, which then gives the
modiﬁed operational point force F∗
Rn as follows:
F∗
Rn
=
βF∗
h + (1 − β)FRn
(5)
According to the above deﬁnition, if β is close to 1,
then the operational point motion is close to that given
by the operational force. By optimizing β, we can reduce
both the interference force interference at the operational
point and the end-effecter motion error. Thus M-HI enables
the user to accurately control the PAS’s end-effecter from
anywhere on the PAS. The control ﬂow of OPMH, including
β optimization, is shown in Fig. 12. The evaluation function
V for optimizing the system is deﬁned as follows:

V is minimized through optimization of β. In Eq. (7), Vf is
changed between 0 and 1 by the direction of Fa. In Eq. (9),
Vp is changed between 0 and 1 by the direction that gives a
decrease in the end-effecter motion error resulting from the
reduction of Fa. Hence, OPMH optimizes β such that V
is minimized through Vf and Vp. If Vf takes precedence,
then β becomes close to 1, and if Vp takes precedence,
then β becomes close to 0. Examples of each evaluation
function during the controlling of PAS with M-HI and
applying OPMH are shown in Fig. 13. In this experiment,
β is optimized by the following method. During a step
controlling the PAS with M-HI, β is changed from 0.00 to
1.00 in increments of 0.01. In each β, the evaluation function
V is calculated. The β which has the smallest V is chosen
as the optimized β in this controlling step. We see a clear
change in β from 0 to 1 dependent on the values of Vf
and Vp. The deﬁnitions of ∆r∗
P3ref and∆rP3ref are shown
in Eq. (12),(11) and Fig. 14. Here, ∆t represents the time
during a step calculating the PAS motion and moving the
PAS.
V. EVALUATION OF OPMH
We evaluate the effect of OPMH by using both a computer
simulation to remove individual variation of experimental
motions and guarantee repeatability. We evaluate the effect
of OPMH through computer simulation by examining the

experiment, the absolute value of Fh increases from 10 to
40 N in 10 N intervals, and we evaluate the operational point
interference force and the end-effecter tracking error.

B. Target path tracking error
Next, we evaluate the motion error of PAS’s end-effecter
caused by applying OPMH. The motion error of PAS’s end-
effecter is calculated by Eq. (4). The experimental results
are shown in Fig. 16. Here, the simulations of the case
when β = 0 are not plotted since F∗
Rn = FRn and hence
εr = 0 from Eqs. (5) and (4). Fig. 16 shows εr compared
by Fh under the target path rt4. According to the ﬁgure, εr
values under the optimized β is less than the values under the
β = 1.0 as we had expected. The error of the end-effecter
when position tracking to the target path was 23.8% at P1
and 60.6% at P2.According to this result, an improvement in
control accuracy is found by using OPMH and its parametar
β optimization. The experimental resulats of
¯
|Fa| and εr
shows that the PAS with M-HI applied OPMH move can-
celing Fa with minimum P3 motion error. Therefore OPMH
is expected the improvement of operational feelings with the
minimum P3control accuracy loss.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this report, we applied M-HI to a 3-link PAS. We
deﬁned the force affected by the PAS’s operational point
as the interference force and analyzed the interference phe-
nomenon of this force. We proposed OPMH as a method
for reducing the interference force interference and for
tracing the user’s operational force. We evaluated the effects
of OPMH by computer simulation. From the experimental
results, we have shown the improvements in operational
accuracy and efﬁciency of applying OPMH to the PAS
with M-HI. Regarding operational accuracy, the error of the
end-effecter when position tracking to the target path was
23.8% at P1 and 60.6% at P2.According to experimental
result, OPMH is expected the improvement of operational
feelings with the minimum control accuracy loss as we
had expected. Therefore, we conﬁrmed the effectiveness of
OPMH applying PAS with M-HI.
