Abstract— There is a widely held belief in the natural language
processing (NLP) and computational linguistics communities
that knowledge recognition such us Named Entities (NE)
recognition is a significant step toward improving important
applications, e.g., question answering and natural language
understanding (NLU). In this paper, we present an NE
recognition system for Modern Standard Arabic using the
NooJ platform. This system exploits many aspects of the rich
morphological features of the language. The experiments on
the pilot Arabic Propbank data show that our system based on
linguistic rules produces a global NE recognition F-measure
score of 87%, which improves the current state of the art in
Arabic NE recognition.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The extraction and automatic recognition of named
entities (NE) is a part of a syntactico-semantic analysis,
which is a step that follows the morpho-lexical analysis
during the automatic processing of a text or a corpus. This
extraction
consists
in
exhibiting
certain
grammatical
concepts or syntactic structures, checking their validity and
attesting their belonging to particular grammatical classes
such as ”proper names”, ”temporal expressions”, ”numerical
expressions”, ”abbreviations” , etc.
From
the
beginning,
the
implementation
of
the
lexicographical
solution,
subsisting
of
electronic
dictionaries enumerating all the named entities, has proven
to be impossible. In particular, this is due to the problems of
multiple writing and the lack of standard writing or
transcription of NE, especially those of foreign origin, to the
target language. Indeed, it is impossible to enumerate all the
proper names in lists, as well as to collect and to maintain
them. It is also impossible to treat all spelling variants and
to resolve the resulting ambiguity.
Three fundamental approaches have been used for the
extraction of NE issue in literature. These approaches are:
rule-based approach, learning-based approach and hybrid
approach. However, the most commonly used methods for
NE recognition are often machine learning-based methods.
In the last two decades, rule-based methods for NER
(Named
Entity
Recognition)
have
progressively
been
abandoned. Nevertheless, these methods are robust and their
results are accurate. They are generally based on non-
contextual grammars. Thus, our major concern in this study
is to examine a rule-based NE extraction and syntactico-
semantic annotation of such important knowledge. For this
purpose, we use the non-contextual grammars offered in the
NooJ language development platform [10] where they are
called local grammars that are used to locate in a very
precise way local phenomena very precisely in texts, such as
dates, numerical determinants, proper names, names of
places and organisms, etc. These grammars are lexicalized
graphs [10], which use dictionaries of simple and compound
words. They are equivalent to recursive networks of
transitions (RTN) or even networks of increased transitions
(ATNs). In practical, local grammars are graphs that can call
independent sub-graphs. Among the advantages of such a
structure are the effectiveness of its direct application to
texts, the recognition of complex linguistic concepts as well
as transformational analysis and annotations production.
The choice of NooJ platform is guided by the fact that
NooJ
is
a
freely
available
linguistic
development
environment for many languages [1]. It allows developers to
construct, test and maintain large coverage lexical resources
as well as to apply morphological morpho-syntactic tools
for Arabic processing [1]. NooJ can recognize rules written
in
finite-state
form
or
context-free
grammar
form,
facilitating the development of rule-based NER systems.
Nooj
provides
a
disambiguation
technique
based
on
grammars to resolve duplicate annotations [1]. Arabic is one
of the languages that are supported by NooJ; there are free
Arabic resources for use within the NooJ environment on
the NooJ official Web site [1]. Mesfar [5] and Lhioui
[3][15] have also used NooJ in their Arabic NER research..
In this paper, we suggest a Named Entities extraction
system for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that exploits
many aspects of the rich morphological features of the
language. It is based on a linguistic approach that uses NooJ
technology for the detection of such knowledge. Given the
lack of a reliable electronic Arabic dictionaries, and thanks
to their coverage, our strategy uses the EL-DicAr dictionary
[2] developed by the NooJ platform and its extension
developed in [3] for the step of morphological analysis.

In this article, we begin by presenting some of the
existing work on Arabic NE extraction. Then, we describe
the difficulties inherent in the recognition of NE. After that,
we explain with more details our preconized approach.
Finally, we check and evaluate our proposed approach.
This paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 presents the
definition of named entity concept and its categorizations;
Section 3 outlines different approaches that treat this
problematic and some related works; Section 4 reveals some
difficulties that inhibit the extraction of NE in texts written
in Arabic language; Section 5 describes and argue the
approach and system adopted for this work; Section 6 gives
the experimental setup, results and discussion. Finally,
Section 7 draws our conclusions.
II.
THE NAMED ENTITY CONCEPT DEFINITION
AND CATEGORIZATIONS
The extraction of NE is one of the most popular areas in
recent years. According to MUC (Message Understanding
Conference) [4], we distinguish at least three types of
entities to be recognized and classified by category [2][3]:
•
ENAMEX: This class groups the proper names.
Indeed,
proper
names
are
very
common
in
electronic texts, especially journalistic articles.
However, in spite of the frequency of their
appearances and the importance of the information
they encapsulate in particular for the semantic
interpretation of the texts, the proper names remain
inadequately illustrated in the electronic lexical
resources and their automatic extraction is just only
a relatively young field. This class contains at least
three subcategories:
o
Person: Names of persons such as names
of politicians, poets, athletes, etc.
o
Organization: refers to
the names of
companies,
banks,
associations,
universities, research centers, pharmacies,
clinics, etc.
o
Event: such as sporting events, political
events, war and crime event, etc.
•
NUMEX: This class groups numeric expressions of
percentages, size, currency expressions, etc.
•
TIMEX: This class refers to temporal expressions
of date or duration.
III.
RELATED WORK
Numerous studies have been conducted on the Latin
languages as well as the Arabic language to automatically
extract knowledge. Looking over the state of the art, we
have found that there are three main types of extraction
systems of named entities. These systems are based on three
types of approaches, which are, respectively:
•
Rule-based
approach:
Most
systems
use
this
approach. Typical rule-based systems use both
internal and external evidence, as well as word-
trigger dictionaries for locating help. The rules are
manually
built
by
an
expert
linguist.
The
advantages of such approach are principally the
accuracy, the robustness and the coverage of the
obtained results. In brief, this kind of approach is
has been well appreciated so far in literature [3][5]-
[7].
•
Learning
approach:
Systems
based
on
this
approach
use
stochastic
techniques
and
learn
specific knowledge on a large learning corpus
where target NEs are labeled. Learning algorithms
are then applied automatically to develop a NE
base using several statistical models (such as
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector
Machine
(SVM),
Conditional
Random
Fields
(CRF), etc.) [8][9]. Nevertheless, this approach
requires a huge amount of learning data for its
learning algorithm, which is quasi-absent for some
scientific research neglected languages, such as
Arabic [1].
•
Hybrid approach: This approach combines the two
above-mentioned
approaches
for
their
complementarity. This approach leads to systems
based on the use of both manually-written and
rules that are constructed automatically using
syntactic and contextual information derived from
training data to learning algorithms and decision
trees [11][12].
The adequacy of rule-based systems was recognized at
the MUC conference. It is this same technique that we
advocate for the development of a recognition component of
named entities. This component is based on rules written by
hand and represented in the form of local grammars that are
constructed using the syntactic module of NooJ. These rules
were based on internal and external evidence in order to
identify and categorize named entities where:
•
Internal evidence: is provided by the constituents
of the named entity. The constituents can be
contained in lists of triggering words or proper
names called gazetteers.
•
External evidence: is provided by the context in
which, a named entity appears. They are based on
the syntactic relations within a sentence to assign
the category of such an entity. This categorization
uses the morpho-syntactic information provided by
the previous morphological analysis stage.
The use of this evidence is indispensable because of the
absence of obvious indications to detect the presence of a
proper name, such as the presence of capital letters at the
beginning of such names in the Romance languages. This
imposes
a
rather
thorough
understanding
of
the
morphological nature of each form of the text, particularly
its grammatical categories and semantic information (e.g., +
Person, + Country, + Housing, + Money, etc.).

IV.
ISSUES IN NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
According to the state of the art overfished by [3][5]
[13], the recognition of the TIMEX and NUMEX in Arabic
poses no problem, this can be challenging in the case of the
ENAMEX. This can be explained by the lack of structural
or contextual indices. In fact, all temporal and numerical
expressions are identifiable by a list of lexical markers (day
names, month names, currencies, units of measure, etc.). On
the other hand, ENAMEX suffers from a lack of structural
or contextual clues to be recognized.
Moreover, in addition to the absence of capital letters as
a naïve index for recognition in Latin languages, Arabic
ENAMEX requires linguistic information to be dynamically
generated by a prior semantic annotation step.
Other problems specific to the recognition of the NE in
Arabic arise also in the identification and delimitation as in
the semantic annotation of these NE. In what follows, we
depict the repercussion of the absence of voyellation and the
problem of delimitation of the Arabic NE.
A.
The absence of vowels
The
absence
of
diacritical
marks
may
affect
the
recognition systems of named entities. This is mainly due to
the semantic ambiguity that arises from the set of potential
vocalizations that can be attributed to any partial vowel or
unvoiced form. Indeed, vocalizations accepted for any form
of text can lead to the absence of diacritical signs and it can
affect the recognition systems of named entities. This is
mainly traceable to the semantic ambiguity that arises from
the set of potential vocalizations that can be attributable to
any partial vowel or unvoiced form. Indeed, vocalizations
accepted for some form of text can lead to different triggers
of NE. For example, the unbounded formﻢّﻠﻌﻣ(m‘llm) can
accept, among other things, the two following vocalizations:
in different senses the triggers of the NE.
•
 ٌﻢِّﻠَﻌُﻣ(mu‘allimu) : Word trigger for a teacher
•
 ٌﻢَﻠْﻌَﻣ(ma.‘alamu) : Word trigger for a museum of
monuments
This example illustrates the implications of the absence
of vowels in the text words on the annotation step of the
named entities.
B.
Morphological complexity
Arabic is a highly-inflected
language. It uses an
agglutinative strategy to form a word. If NE appears in its
agglutinative form, then this poses a difficulty for the
identification and hence the recognition of this entity [3].
For example, if we take the simple wordﺎَﻨُﺗَﺪْﻠَﺑ<baldatunA>,
which means ”our town”, this Arabic word is composed
from two sub-words: the lemma ﺪﻠﺑ <balda> ”town” and the
suffix ﺎﻨﺗ <tunA> ”our”. Hence, it would be difficult and 
ambiguous in Arabic processing to treat agglutinative
words. Many works focus on this phenomenon. However,
NooJ gives the possibility to treat agglutination problem by
the use of flexional and derivational rules [10]. Hence, the
choice of NooJ linguistic tool, in our work, is justified.
V.
OUR RULE-BASED METHOD FOR NE
RECOGNITION AND SEMANTIC ANNOTATION
To remedy all these problems, we construct a system of
recognition and extraction of Arabic entities. According to
Figure 1, we proceed:
•
A morphological analysis: to collect the maximum
information for all the words of the text. This is
done
with
a
consultation
of
the
electronic
dictionary El-DicAr of [2] and the Arabic touristic
dictionary developed by [3].
•
Subsequently, this information will be used in local
syntactico-semantic grammars in order to locate the relevant
sequences.
Figure 1. General architecture of the recognition of the Arab NE
A.
Morphological Analysis
Given the agglutinating structure of the majority of
Arabic words, our morphological analyzer makes it possible
to separate and identify the morphemes of the input forms
and to associate them with the set of information necessary
for the current processing. These forms are decomposed to
recognize the affixes (conjunctions, prepositions, personal
pronouns, etc.) attached to them. These morphological
possibilities in NooJ facilitate the identification of triggering
words, names of persons or localities even when they are
agglutinated.
Each of these forms is associated, by morphological
analysis, with a set of linguistic information useful for the
next step: lemma, grammatical label, gender and number,
syntactic information (+ Transitive), semantic information
(+ Person), etc.
Consequently, instead of enumerating all the inflected
forms (singular, dual, plural, masculine, feminine) of the
occupational names considered as lexical markers of person
names (e.g.,سﺪﻨﮭﻣ<engineer>), we use the syntax of the
regular expressions of NooJ where the grammatical symbol
سﺪﻨﮭﻣ(<mhnds>, <engineer>) refers to all vocalized,
partially vocalized, and unvoiced bent forms attached to this
lemma. Our morphological analysis is based on two Arabic
dictionaries described in table III:

The two dictionaries are also used and detailed in [16].
B.
NE Semantic Annotation
The information provided by morphological analysis is
directly used by our recognition system of named entities.
In addition to its morpho-syntactic information gathered,
this system is based on the use of two types of linguistic
resources:
•
Gazetteers: these are lexical markers previously
recognized
as
potential
members
of
properly
named and properly classified entities. Among
these, we perceive:
o
Names of persons
o
Names
of
places:
countries,
cities,
regions, states, names of roads, seas,
oceans, mountains, rivers, etc.
o
Names
of
organizations:
associations
(regional,
national
and
international),
universities, televisions, banks, etc.
o
Currency expressions: cost, money, etc.
o
Temporal expressions: the names of the
days of the week, months, etc.
•
Local Grammars: These are represented in the form
of Augmented Transition Network-ATNs. They are
used to represent sequences of words. These
sequences are described by manually written rules
and
consequently
produce
certain
linguistic
information such as the type of the identified
named entity (person name, organization, location,
etc.).

linguistic
platform.

Local grammars for the extraction and annotation of
NUMEX:
The
problem
of
automatic
recognition
of
numerical determinants in a text is part of the more or less
complex linguistic phenomena. Generally, they can not be
processed at the level of lexical analysis. They require very
redundant descriptions that would be very tedious, if not
impossible,
to
describe
them
manually
in
electronic
dictionaries compiled in the form of finite automata.
We have classified numerical expressions into four
categories: percentage expressions, weight expressions,
measurement expressions, and monetary expressions (see
Figure 3).
Then, we focused on the extraction of numerical values.
Figure 3. Main sub-graphs of the different types of NE.
Figure 4 shows the main recognition graph of these
values. This is restricted to call to sub-graphs relating to the
identification of numerals representing units, tens, hundreds
and thousands. As outputs, we attribute the grammatical
category ”DET” (a determinant), the semantic information
”+NUM” (numerical) as well as the arithmetic value that it
represents ”+Val”. Thus, each recognized numeral occurs
with its equivalent written in numbers.

2)
Local grammars for extraction and annotation of
TIMEX: Temporal expressions, TIMEX, are as important as
numerical expressions in syntactic or information extraction
systems. Indeed, a user can query our system to get
information about an event. Usually, any event is linked to a
date or time represented as a time expression. As a result,
according to
Figure 5, our rule-based system allows the
extraction of ages, hours, dates and periods.
Figure 5. Main sub-graph describing the local grammar responsible for the
extraction of TIMEX
3)
Local grammars for extraction and annotation of
ENAMEX: In our work, the ENAMEX extraction means the
extraction of proper names , localizations and organizations.
Figure 6 shows the NooJ local grammar [10], which is
responsible for the syntaxic-semantic annotation of different
ENAMEX type.
Figure 6. Main graph describing the local grammar responsible for
extracting expressions associated with ENAMEX
For the names of places, we began by developing a
grammar of internal proofs associated to the cities name,
regions, hotels, itineraries, avenues, rivers, seas, oceans, etc.
Thus, we identified the triggering words asﺔﻨﯾﺪﻣ(<mdiynT>,
<city>), ﻞﺒﺟ (<jbl>, < mountain >), ةﺮﯾﺰﺟ(<jzIrT>,
<island>),ﺔﻟود(<dwlT>, <country>),ﺞﮭﻧ(<nhj>, <avenue>).
These lexical (triggers) markers are used to describe
recognition rules in local grammars. Figure 7 shows the
main graph of local grammar responsible for the extraction
of localization expressions. In the same manner, this
grammar is implemented with linguistic NooJ platform.
Figure 7. Main sub-graph describing the local grammar responsible for
extracting location expressions
Besides the places name, we made the recognition
grammar of people names. Figure 8 below shows a
graphical implementation of proper names grammar in NooJ
platform.

extracting proper names expressions

The identification of organizations names began with the
elaboration
of
a
dictionary,
which
contains
959
organizations names such as:ﻮﻜﺴﻧﻮﯾ(<yUnskw>, Unesco)
recognized by the mean of (N + Org) syntactico-semantic
annotation or what we call lexical markers. We note that the
majority of entries are compound and abbreviated words.
Then, we have a list of 626 trigger words like ﺔﺴﺳﺆﻣ 
(<m’wssasT>, company),ﺔﯿﻌﻤﺟ(<jm‘yT>, association), and
so
on.
These
lexical
markers
are
used
to
describe
recognition rules in local grammars. In total, we have ten
sub-graphs that implement recognition global grammar of
organizations name (cf. Figure 9)
Figure 9. Main sub-graph describing the local grammar responsible to
extracting names and abbreviations for organizations
VI.
EVALUATION OF THE NE EXTRACTION
SYSTEM
After
collecting
the
corpus,
we
had
to
go
to
experimentation. This step seems to be the most important
one because it measures the reliability of the work.
The experimentation of our resources was done with
NooJ concordance [10]. As mentioned before, this platform
uses
(syntactical,
morphological
and
semantic)
local
grammars already built.
Traditionally, the evaluation of any information retrieval
system relies on the computation of a set of metrics. These
calculations make it possible to evaluate the proportion of
the errors displayed by the system relative to the ideal result.
The metrics usually used are: Recall (R), Accuracy (P),
F-Measure (F).
We evaluate our recognition system on 70% of the
Arabic PropBank [14] and a 70% of our own corpus
described in [3] (see Table II). The rest of these corpora is
used for the test.
An evaluation carried out on these corpora gives the
results presented in Table III.
Our syntactico semantic recognizer yields F-scores
included in the interval of [76%-96%] which are satisfying
measures compared to [8], [12] and [14].

CONCLUSION
We have described a system for extracting proper nouns,
temporal and numerical expressions through a combination
of morphological analyzer and a rule-based recognition
system using local NooJ grammars. This permitted to
achieve performance by providing lexical coverage in more
than 87%. Despite the above-described problems, the
recommended method seems to be adequate and exhibits
very encouraging extraction rates.
