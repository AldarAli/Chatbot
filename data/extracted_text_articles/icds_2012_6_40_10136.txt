Abstract— The objective of the work is to propose a 
distributed embedded architecture model for tolerating faults 
while performing security functions using multiple field 
programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The hardware encryption 
and decryption modules are used as customized modules 
within the devices to act as a cooperative system to tolerate 
omission and commission faults. The different security 
functions are communicating through a common UART 
channel and security operations are synchronized with 
standard protocols initiated by an embedded micro controller. 
The decision in locating the working and available modules 
among a pool of devices is carried out by the microcontroller 
using an intelligent F-map mechanism and directs the control 
instructions. The model is scalable with increased number of 
similar 
devices 
when 
connected 
across 
the 
common 
communication channel. The model is verified for all its paths 
using Symbolic Model Verifier, NuSMV to assert the dynamic 
behavior of the architecture in case of different faulty 
conditions.

 INTRODUCTION 
The security architecture of embedded systems depends 
not only on the functional and performance requirements 
but also on the cost and spatial requirements suited to the 
target platforms. For example, the data path should be 
secured against many privacy attacks in the case of 
embedded systems used in the mobile applications. The data 
flow based on the dependence graph is solely determined by 
the components embedded as intellectual properties to 
perform the expected computations in real time. The 
architecture suitable for such computations with the security 
primitive components should be formally verified in order 
to 
avoid 
security 
errors 
like 
communication 
and 
synchronization errors. Due to the heterogeneity of various 
security hardware components from different component 
vendors, integration of them may lead to further challenges 
in the architectural design. The earlier SAFES architecture 
[1] focuses on the reconfigurable hardware that monitors the 
system behavior to realize the intrusion detections. The 
other proposed SANES architecture [2] focuses on security 
controller and component controller components to monitor 
the abnormal behavior in the system run time. Irrespective 
of the cryptographic algorithm used in the security 
primitive, the primitive components are to be self tested 
since the data path may vary dynamically in the case of a 
distributed embedded system. The components may not be 
available at some point of time when they are in need and 
they should be available in a fault free condition within the 
distributed mesh of devices. The correct selection of the 
primitive components either in the source or in the 
destination FPGA is to be decided in a power efficient 
manner among a pool of similar devices. The security 
processes are to be completed in the correct sequence and 
the operations are to be enabled as in the same dataflow 
form when they are completed [3]. The components are 
treated as resources within a single device to complete the 
submitted task and other similar devices are considered as 
coordinating devices controlled by a centralized controller. 
A field mapping technique is proposed through which the 
resource components available in the devices will be 
connected to form a distributed system considering the 
power consumption and the propagation delay involved in 
the on demand architecture. The distributed security 
architecture model has to be formally verified for its 
behavior to meet the reachability and fail free conditions. 
The standard NuSMV tool [5] supports LTL model 
checking [5] where the individual parameters can be 
inspected to investigate the effect of choices. Existing 
embedded system architectures are not capable of keeping 
up with the computational demands of security processing, 
due to increasing data rates and complexity of security 
protocols [7]. High assurance cryptographic applications 
require a design to be portioned and physically independent 
to ensure information cannot leak between secure design 
partitions. Ensuring this partition separation in the event of

independent hardware faults is one of the principle tenets of 
a high-assurance design [8]. FPGAs are highly promising 
devices 
for 
implementing 
private-key 
cryptographic 
algorithms. Compared to software based solutions FPGA [9] 
based implementations can achieve superior performance 
and security. Hence the main focus of the work is to propose 
a fault tolerant distributed architecture model for security 
hardware and check the model for its expected behavior 
meeting the specifications or against it. 
The organization of the paper is as follows: Section 2 
proposes the distributed embedded architecture for the 
security hardware using a single reconfigurable FPGA 
device with all the needed security primitive components. 
Section 3 discusses the sequences of processes to meet the 
performance requirements of the security architecture. The 
next section 4 extends the single system on chip to multi 
FPGA model where the data packet is routed between four 
similar devices under different faulty situations that lead to 
the worst case performance of the model. The next section 
explains the role of the micro controller in managing the 
field mapping of the devices when needed security 
components are faulty. Section 7 illustrates the model 
checking using NuSMV and its verified output and explores 
the scalability of the architecture along with its limitations 
like the issue of packet conflicts along the communication 
path in UART. 
II. 
DISTRIBUTED EMBEDDED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The architecture selection depends on the resource 
availability and reliability requirements of the security 
system. A reconfigurable platform like FPGA in addition to 
a high speed micro controller can organize the different 
computations needed to control the sequence of operations 
in the system.  The resources are available in the form of 
intellectual properties (IPs) within the chip and these are to 
be assigned with the tasks in an efficient manner by the 
micro controller as the central manager. The best suitable 
architecture is the distributed embedded architecture where 
the resources are different sets of workers and the operations 
are performed in data flow form. The basic security 
hardware architecture consists of an encryption and 
decryption modules for 64 bit size along with their 
corresponding activation switches. The data transmission 
and reception takes place through the transmitter and 
receiver modules placed in the same chip and configured for 
different baud rates and actual process takes places through 
a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) 
module. The configuration of the security modules are self 
tested by the wired built-in self test (BIST) components 
connected with them to tolerate functional faults and 
controlled by a BIST Controller to regulate the data flow. 
All the components are selected or enabled by the control 
signals from device selector (DEVICE SEL) as shown in 
Fig. 1. The device reads the plain text from the keyboard 
and routes through the encryption and decryption modules 
as per the instructions received the micro controller that may  
reside inside or outside the chip assembly and connected 
through a bus. The deciphered text will be displayed in the 
activated display unit of the selected chip.  
The micro controller is responsible for maintaining the 
queue of tasks and allocates the tasks to computational 
module as and when they are fail free. Because of the 
different execution times needed for different resources for 
processing the tasks, the micro controller has to run an 
intelligence algorithm to decide the available resource for 
that instant of time to forward the data. The micro controller 
gets the updated components information by regular sample 
intervals and refreshes its resource status (RST) and device 
status table (DST) in the private registers. The control 
signals are issued by the device select component as and 
when needed to send or receive. In case where there are 
concurrent requests from multiple devices over the limited 
bandwidth channel, then the micro controller forms a 
priority table to decide the order in which the queue of tasks 
may be completed. The micro controller is embedded with 
the algorithm to assign the priority to various requests.

SEQUENCE OF PROCESSES 
The 
security 
components 
needed 
to 
perform 
cryptographic operations are to be initialized with requests 
from the central manager component that is the micro 
controller. The sequence of processes is determined based 
on the availability of those components in their fault free 
conditions so that the data flow can be triggered. The 
enabling and disabling of the components in the pool of 
resources is taken care by the intelligent algorithm called F-
Map embedded in the micro controller. For encryption of 
the text that is coming through an input peripheral say, 
keyboard connected to any one of the FPGA device, the 
sequence of processes is different from that of the 
decryption processes towards the output peripheral say, 
display device connected to other or the same FPGA device. 
For any FPGA to work it is mandatory that the 
Transmission, Reception switches & the UART connection 
to function properly. The microcontroller maintains two

table a Device Status Table (DST), where a Farm of FPGAs 
that can take part in the security process are listed and 
Resource Status Table (RST), where the resource status of 
each FPGA in the device farm is listed. During runtime 
micro controller forms a Run Time Table in which all the 
working set of FPGAs, obtained from DST with all its 
resources in fault-free condition (resource status obtained 
from the RST) for the current operation i.e. encryption or 
decryption, are enlisted depending on power dissipation 
(Power Aware mode) or propagation delay (Performance 
mode) of the FPGAs.

IV. 
MULTI FPGA BASED FAULT TOLERANT 
DISTRIBUTED EMBEDDED SYSTEM 
The distributed embedded architecture on chip proposed 
in the work can be integrated with similar devices so as to 
make a distributed fault tolerant model. A micro controller 
is connected to instruct and manage the resource allocation 
between the devices based on the fault free conditions of the 
needed components. The algorithm that is embedded in the 
controller accepts the status of all the devices in terms of 
their resource components and decides the routing that the 
plain or cipher text has to follow as shown in Fig 2. The 
reliability of the distributed system is enhanced by 
component dynamic redundancy technique as and when the 
fault gets detected. Even though the functional component is 
static within a device, the controller calls the fault free 
components dynamically. The availability and system 
reliability is enhanced at the cost of communication 
overhead between the controller and the status table register 
multiple times. Since the performance depends on the speed 
of completion of the submitted task, the reliability of the 
system gets improved over the expected performance level.

Figure 3.  Microcontroller System Level Behaviour. 
In the distributed architecture, the microcontroller 
behavior starts from instructing the distributed architectutre 
of FPGAs  in its Null state. After a time interval (when an 
implicit or watchdog timer expires) its state transits from 
Null to Get_Status state (MT1). The state changes from 
Get_Status to Monitor_Req when the microcontroller 
successfully reads the status of all the FPGAs (MT2). The 
coordinating micro controller continues to remain in 
148

Monitor_Req state until any request is made (MT3). The 
state transits from Monitor_Req to Get_Info if a request is 
made by any one of the FPGAs (MT4). On occurance of any 
data error during the request,  the controller tracks back 
from Get_Info to Monitor_Req (MT5). On successfully 
aquiring the information from FPGAs, a state transition 
occurs from Get_Info to Analyse_Requester_Status (MT6). 
If all the resource primitive components at the source and 
destination FPGAs are fault-free, a state changes from 
Analyse_Requester_Status to Normal_Service (MT7). On 
successful completion of the task state transits from 
Normal_Service state to Monitor_Req state (MT8). If 
source or destination devices or both have non availability 
errors in any of their resources, the controller changes state 
from Analyse_Requester_Status to Worst_Case_Service 
(MT9). On successful completion of the event, the state 
changes from Worst_Case_Service state to Monitor_Req 
(MT10). The control remains in the Normal_Service state 
until  the predefined time elapses on occurance of a 
communication error  (MT11). The microcontroller changes 
state from Normal_Service to Get_Info state if the error 
continues to persist at the end of the predefined time interval 
(MT12). While encountering various errors, the control 
remains in the Worst_Case_Service state until the 
predefined time elapses (MT13). The control changes 
Worst_Case_Service to Get_Info state if the error exists 
when the predefined time is exhausted (MT14). The control 
of 
operations 
shift 
from 
Worst_Case_Service 
to 
Normal_Service when the micro controller finds the updated 
status of the resouce primitive components at the source and 
destination FPGAs to be fault-free (MT15) as in Fig 3. The 
fault tolerant 
technique 
using available 
fault 
free 
components can be extended to the situation when multiple 
FPGA devices are interconnected. Assuming similar 
devices, the security operations are executed in different 
devices based on the primitive components availability. If 
not, the correct routing instruction will be issued by the 
micro controller based on its updated device table and 
corresponding resource tables. The reliability of the 
communication path  between the devices is a major 
challenge in the design of the above multi FPGA based 
distributed embedded security system.The synchronization 
in the execution of primitive operations is taken care by the 
embedded algorithm residing in the micro controller.

F MAP FOR RESOURCE SELECTION 
The Farm map (F-Map) is an intelligent algorithm by 
which the micro controller identifies the next device that has 
the needed security primitive components. The mapping 
brings the current status of the resources and fills the cell as 
‘1’ in the START FPGA which indicates that the DEVICE 
SELECT and the BIST for Encryption components are in 
failed states as shown in Fig 5. The algorithm searches the 
next device, depending upon whether the FPGAs are 
operated in power save mode or performance mode and in 
which all the needed components are fault free that is 
indicated by 1 cell for encryption process. Similarly the 
same algorithm is iterated for the decryption process also to 
get the data packet encrypted and communicated to the 
destination. The decryption may take place in the 
destination FPGA device. If multiple ‘1’ cells are appearing 
at any time among different devices, then the controller 
selects the shortest path to minimize the communication 
delay to avoid any attack on the device itself that is possible 
in the distributed FPGA architecture. The Device Select at 
the destination FPGA is in failed state which makes the 
micro controller iterate for the next FPGA with the required 
resources in Fault-free state. The alternate FPGA for 
decryption process is selected depending on whether the 
distributed FPGA architecture is operated in performance 
mode or power aware mode. ACTIVE_DECRYPT_FPGA1 
is chosen when operating in performance aware mode and 
149

ACTIVE_DECRYPT_FPGA2 is chosen while operating in 
power aware mode. The performance characteristics of the 
distributed FPGA vary with the operating mode. For quicker 
response, the Distributed architecture may be operated in 
performance mode which causes higher power dissipation in 
the device. While operating in power save mode, the 
propagation delay is high, but the power consumed is 
minimal, as shown in Table. 1. 
Propagation Delay = n * T                                               (1)

PERFORMANCE IN BEST CASE AND WORST CASE 
SCENARIO 
In the distributed embedded system, if all the 
resources in the source and destination FPGAs are fault-
free then the micro controller chooses the normal 
operating mode which is the best case scenario. The 
behavior of the embedded system during its best case 
performance is shown in Fig. 6 and its transitions are 
mentioned in Table. 2. The behavior of the distributed 
embedded system varies when a resource in source or 
destination FPGA is in failed state, depending upon the 
mode of operation viz. Performance Mode, Power Aware 
Mode, Safe Mode, depicted by the worst case behavior is 
shown in Fig. 7. 
The microcontroller iterates various paths from the 
source to the destination depending upon the mode of 
operation and selects the FPGAs in source or destination 
side, with its required resources in fault free condition.

Figure 7.  Worst Case Scenario. 
While the distributed Embedded system is in its Worst 
Case behavior, the microcontroller acquires the status of  
all the FPGAs present in the distributed embedded system 
(BT1). In case of failure of acquisition of the status, the 
microcontroller waits in a null state until the status of the 
FPGAs are updated (BT2). Depending upon the mode of 
operation during resource failure in the source FPGA, the 
microcontroller searches for an alternate FPGA for 
encryption  process(BT3). On selection of a suitable 
FPGA, the data from the source FPGA is transferred for 
encryption process (BT5). The microcontroller continues 
to exist in Get_Data state until the data is completely 
transferred to the alternate FPGA (BT6). On occurance of 
any errors during the data acquisition process, the 
microcontroller tracks back to its initial state (BT7). On 
completion of encryption process, a FPGA is selected by 
the microcontroller for decryption on the destination side 
(BT8). On successful selction of FPGA with all its 
resources in fault free condition, process of decryption 
takes place (BT10). The microcontroller traces itself to its 
initial state on failure of the decryption process (BT9). 
The decrypted data is ultimately sent to the destination 
FPGA until which the microcontroller remains in its 
current  state (BT11). On successful reception of the 
complete decrypted data by the destination FPGA, the 
microcontroller prepares itself for the next encryption 
process (BT13), else the microcontroller resets to repeat 
the failed process (BT12).        
VII. MODEL CHECKING OF  ARCHITECTURE USING 
NUSMV 
There are two extreme cases in which the fault tolerant 
capability can be measured. In one case, all the needed 
security components are fail free and available in a single 
chip and thereby the communication delay will be only 
due to transmit and receive signal propagation making 
power consumption very high. The other extreme is when 
one set of encryption components may be available in 
nearby device where as the decryption set of components 
in other end of the array or pool of devices and vice versa 
[6]. This condition leads to huge delay due to multiple 
enable, multiple address and data signals along with 
multiple receive, transmit and multiple device select 
signals. The worst case performance where the micro 
controller searches for the fail free encryption and 
decryption components is verified using the symbolic 
model verifier as shown below. The model checking is 
done to check the reliability of the model during the worst 
case performance and to verify the availability of alternate 
resources to complete the specified task. The LTL and 
CTL operations are applied as specifications to verify the 
availability of devices and the needed security resources 
for the encryption and decryption processes as given in 
NuSMV code below:

The model checking algorithm reports true if 
specification holds true for every state of the system 
model. Otherwise, states not satisfying the specification 
are identified. A transition path from a defined initial state 
to a state identified as not satisfying the specification is 
called counterexample [4]. The CTL properties of the 
proposed security farm architecture is verified using  
NuSMV for different specifications  and the result with

VIII. CONCLUSION AND FURUTE WORKS 
A distributed embedded architecture model for 
security hardware with fault tolerant features is proposed 
to tolerate non availability faults and resource component 
faults. The model is a centralized system in which 
sequential control is exercised by a micro controller 
through the F-map algorithm embedded in it and can be 
scaled as multi FPGA devices pool with power or 
performance awareness. The collective behavior of the 
architecture model is formally verified using a model 
checker based on LTL and CTL properties. The limitation 
of the proposed model is in the communication overhead 
when all devices want to send the data concurrently over 
the limited bandwidth of UART channel. The constraints 
are the assumptions that the basic transmission and 
reception switches must always be fault free even to 
intimate the error report to the central controller. The 
actual implementation of the project with multiple FPGAs 
and triple micro controllers to enhance the reliability is 
the future work planned.
