Abstract—Ultrawideband
(UWB)
systems
show
excellent
potential benefits when used in the design of high-speed digital
wireless home networks. The constantly-increasing demand for
higher data transmission rates can be satisfied by exploiting
both multipath- and spatial-diversity, using multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) together with proper modulation and
coding
techniques.
Unlike
conventional
MIMO
OFDM
systems, the performance of MIMO MB-OFDM UWB systems
does
not
depend
on
the
temporal
correlation
of
the
propagation channel although narrowband interference (NBI)
is still a problem. In this paper we put forward a technique for
suppressing NBI by the use of adaptive narrowband filtering.
The method is compared experimentally with other algorithms
for the identification and cancellation/suppression of complex
NBI in OFDM single-band and multiband (MB) UWB systems.
The study shows that the different schemes offer slightly
differing performances, depending on the parameters of the
MIMO
UWB
system.
The
proposed
complex
adaptive
narrowband filtering technique is an optimal solution which
offers a good balance between NBI suppression efficiency and
computational complexity.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, ultrawideband (UWB) signals have been
employed extensively in communications and ranging
applications. Depending on how the available bandwidth of
the system is used, UWB can be divided into two groups:
single-band and multiband.
Conventional UWB technology is based on single-band
systems and employs carrier-free communications [1]–[3]. It
is implemented by directly modulating information into a
sequence of impulse-like waveforms; support for multiple
users is by means of time-hopping or direct sequence
spreading approaches.
The UWB frequency band of multiband UWB systems
is divided into several sub-bands, with the bandwidth of
each of them being at least 500 MHz [4] [5]. By interleaving
the
symbols
across
sub-bands,
multiband
UWB
can
maintain the power of the transmission as though a wide
bandwidth were being utilized. The advantage of the
multiband approach is that it allows the information to be
processed over a much smaller bandwidth, thereby reducing
overall design complexity as well as improving spectral
flexibility
and
worldwide
adherence
to
the
relevant
standards.
In
order
to
capture
the
multipath
energy
efficiently, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) technique is used to modulate the information in
each sub-band. The major difference with MB-OFDM, as
opposed to more traditional OFDM schemes, is that the
MB-OFDM symbols are not continuously sent on one
frequency-band; instead they are interleaved over different
sub-bands across both time and frequency. Multiple access
of multiband UWB is enabled by the use of suitably-
designed frequency-hopping sequences over the set of sub-
bands.
Most UWB applications are used indoors, thus providing
an
excellent
transmission
environment
for
MIMO
implementation. Moreover, the GHz center frequency of
UWB systems makes the spacing between antenna array
elements less critical. In consequence, the combination of
UWB and MIMO technology becomes an effective method
of achieving the very high data rates required for high-speed
short-range
communications.
Multi-antenna
UWB
technology has been well-explored in conventional single-
band UWB systems [6]–[8]. Conversely, research into
multiband UWB systems employing multiple antennae is as
yet not complete, so the full benefits of UWB-MIMO
communications systems have therefore not been entirely
explored.

The main difference between MIMO OFDM and MIMO
MB-OFDM lies in the channel characteristics. The block

MIMO MB-OFDM UWB system.
In this paper, we look at UWB MIMO systems with
MB-OFDM, a leading technology for many broadband
communication systems [9]. Due to their relatively low
transmission power, such systems are very sensitive to
narrowband interference (NBI). Because of the spectral
leakage effect caused by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
demodulation at the OFDM receiver, many subcarriers near
the interference frequency suffer from serious Signal-to-
Interference Ratio (SIR) degradation, which can adversely
affect or even block communications [10].
The issue of NBI suppression in wideband OFDM
systems is of primary importance in such systems and has
been studied extensively in the last few years [11]. Two
main types of approach are generally adopted. The first
involves various frequency excision methods, whereby the
affected frequency bins of the OFDM symbol are excised or
their usage avoided [12]. The second approach is related to
“cancellation techniques” which are aimed at eliminating or
mitigating the effect of the NBI on the received OFDM
signal [13]. In most cases, the degradation in a MIMO MB-
OFDM-based receiver is beyond the reach of the frequency
excision method when the SIR is less than 0 dB. Thus,
mitigation techniques employing cancellation methods, one
of which is based on complex adaptive filtering and the
other
on
NBI
identification
and
cancellation,
are
recommended as an alternative [14]-[17].
In this paper, a method for NBI cancellation based on
adaptive complex digital filtering, using the Least Mean
Squares (LMS) algorithm to adapt to the central frequency
of the NBI [18], is presented and the method is compared to
other mitigation techniques. The study shows that all
schemes give different performances, depending on the
parameters of the MB-OFDM MIMO UWB system, but the
proposed method offers considerable benefits, including low
computational complexity.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section
II the adaptive filtering scheme using variable complex
adaptive narrowband filter is considered. An adaptive
complex notch filter bank for the cancellation/enhancement
of
multiple
complex
signals
is
also
proposed.
The
simulation model for NBI suppression in UWB systems is
described in Section III. Section IV presents the simulation
results for NBI suppression in UWB channels and MIMO
MB-OFDM systems. Finally, Section V concludes the
paper.
II.
NBI SUPPRESSION USING ADAPTIVE COMPLEX
FILTERING
In comparison with the information wideband signal, the
interference occupies a much narrower frequency band but
has a higher-power spectral density [19]. On the other hand,
the wideband signal usually has autocorrelation properties
quite similar to those of AWGN (Adaptive Wide Gaussian
Noise), so filtering in the frequency domain is possible.
A.
Variable Complex Narrowband Digital Filter
The filtering process is carried out at the input of the
OFDM demodulator by the use of a variable complex filter
with independent tuning of the central frequency and
bandwidth. This is then turned into an adaptive narrowband
filter to be implemented in an OFDM receiver.
A variable complex bandpass (BP) first-order digital
filter designated LS1 (Low Sensitivity) is designed [20]
(Figure 2). The transfer functions of the LS1 section, all of
BP type, are:

effects; secondly, independent control of central frequency
and filter bandwidth over a wide frequency range.

with severely quantized multiplier coefficients and the
general efficiency of the adaptation [22].

SIMULATION MODEL FOR NBI SUPPRESSION IN UWB
SYSTEMS
In order to compare the proposed method with other NBI
suppression methods, such as Frequency Excision (FE) [23]
and Frequency Identification and Cancellation (FIC) [17], a
number
of
simulations
relative
to
complex
baseband
presentation are performed.
The FE method is applied to the OFDM signal with a
complex NBI at the input of the demodulator. The signal is
then
converted
into
the
frequency
domain
by
FFT,
oversampled by 8 and the noise peaks in the spectra of the
signal are limited to the determined threshold. The signal is
subsequently converted back into the time domain and
applied to the input of the demodulator. It should be noted
that, for more precise frequency excision, FFT of a higher
order than the one in the demodulator is applied.
The
FIC
method
is
implemented
as
a
two-stage
algorithm. First, the complex NBI frequency is estimated by
finding the maximum in the oversampled signal spectrum.
Next, using the ML approach, the NBI amplitude and phase
are
estimated.
The
second
stage
realizes
the
NLS
optimization algorithm, where precise estimations of NBI
complex amplitude, phase and frequency are performed.
For the realization of the NBI filtering method, the
complex adaptive notch filter is connected at the receiver’s
input. The adaptation algorithm tunes the filter in such a
way that its central frequency and bandwidth match the NBI
signal spectrum. In the simulations, the central frequency of
the notch filter is chosen to be equal to the NBI central
frequency, while its bandwidth is equal to 20% of the
bandwidth between two adjacent OFDM sub-carriers.
In the OFDM demodulator, the prefix and suffix guard
intervals are removed and a 256-point FFT is applied. The
pilot tones are removed and a channel equalization of the
OFDM symbol is performed. Finally, the corresponding 64-
QAM demodulation and decoding is carried out.
The information source is modeled by a generator of
uniformly
distributed
random
integers
based
on
the
modified version of Marsaglia's “Subtract with borrow
algorithm” [24]. The method can generate all the double-
precision
values
in
the
closed
interval
[2-53,
1-2-53].
Theoretically, this method can generate over 21492 values
before repeating itself.
The channel encoder is implemented as a convolutional
encoder. In the simulation, the code rate: RC = 1/2 is chosen.
In the receiver, a Viterbi hard threshold convolutional
decoder is implemented.
A
block
interleaver-deinterleaver
is
used
in
the
simulation. The algorithm chooses a permutation table
randomly, using the initial state input that is provided.
The digital modulator is implemented as 256-point
IFFT. In the OFDM block demodulator, the prefix and
suffix guard intervals are removed from each channel and
256-point FFT is also applied. The OFDM symbol consists
of 128 data bins and 2 pilot tones. Each discrete piece of
OFDM data can use different modulation formats. In the
experiments, Grey-encoded 64-QAM modulation format is
used. After the IFFT process, the prefix and suffix guard
intervals are added.
For the wireless channel, a multi-ray model with direct
and delayed (reflected) components is used. The delayed
components are subject to fading, while the direct ones are
not. To preserve total signal energy, the direct and delayed
signal components are scaled by the square roots of
K/(K+1) and 1/(K+1) respectively. To simplify simulations,
a complex baseband representation of the system is used
[25] [26].
The NBI is modeled as a single complex tone, the
frequency of which is located centrally between two
adjacent OFDM sub-carriers.
IV.
EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATION RESULTS
A.
NBI Suppression for UWB Channels
Using the above general simulation model, different
experiments were performed, estimating the Bit Error Ratio
(BER) as a function of the SIR. Four types of channels are
considered, i.e., AWGN, CM1, CM2 and CM3 [27] [28].
The CM1, CM2 and CM3 channels are subject to strong
fading and additionally background AWGN is applied, so
that the signal to AWGN ratio at the input of the OFDM
receiver is 20 dB. In Figure 5, a complex AWGN channel is
considered. The SIR is varied from -20 dB to 0 dB. It can be
seen that for high NBI, where the SIR is less than 0 dB, all
methods lead to a significant improvement in performance.
The
complex
adaptive
filtering
scheme
gives
better
performance than the FE method. This could be explained
by the NBI spectral leakage effect caused
by DFT
demodulation at the OFDM receiver, when many sub-
carriers near the interference frequency suffer degradation.
Thus, filtering out the NBI before demodulation is better
than frequency excision. The FIC algorithm achieves the
best result because there is no spectrum leakage, as happens
with frequency excision, and there is no amplitude and
phase distortion as seen in the adaptive filtering case.

It should be noted that the adaptive filtering scheme and
frequency cancellation scheme lead to a degradation of the
overall performance when SIR > 0. This is due either to the
amplitude and phase distortion of the adaptive notch filter,
or to a wrong estimation of NBI parameters during the
identification. The degradation can be reduced by the
implementation of a higher-order notch filter or by using
more
sophisticated
identification
algorithms.
The
degradation effect can be avoided by simply switching off
the filtering when SIR > 0. Such a scheme is easily
realizable as the amplitude of the NBI can be monitored at
the BP output of the filter (Figure 3).
In Figure 9, the results of applying a combination of
methods are presented. A multi-tone NBI (5 sine-wave
interfering signal) is added to the OFDM signal. One of the
NBI tones is 10 dB stronger than the others. The NBI filter
is adapted to track the strongest NBI tone, thus preventing
the loss of resolution and AGC saturation. It can be seen
that the combination of frequency excision plus adaptive
filtering improves the performance, and the combination of
frequency cancellation plus adaptive filtering is even better.

Figure 10 shows BER as a function of SIR for the CM3
channel when QPSK modulation is used, the NBI being
modeled as a complex sine wave. It can be seen that the
relative performance of the different NBI suppression
methods is similar to the one in Figure 6 but the BER is
higher due to the fact that NBI is QPSK modulated.

NBI Suppression for MIMO MB-OFDM systems
To
evaluate
the
performance
of
the
three
NBI
suppression methods, (FE, FIC, and our proposed NBI
filtering method), simulations relative to the complex
baseband presentation are conducted. A standard MIMO
OFDM receiver is assumed and the suppression methods are
applied to the MIMO OFDM signal with a complex NBI at
each input of the receiver independently.
For the NBI filtering method, the complex adaptive
notch filter bank is used. The adaptation algorithm tunes the
filter at each receiver input so that its central frequency and
bandwidth match the NBI signal spectrum. The Frequency
Identification
and
Cancellation
method
estimates
the
complex NBI frequency by determining the maximum in the
oversampled signal spectrum per channel.
The OSTBC model for complex signals is realized using
the methods described in [29], [30]. The number of transmit
antennae NT can be set from 1 to 4 as long as the number of
receive antennae NR can also be set from 1 to 4. For 2x2
MIMO system, the code rate is Rc=1 whereas for 3x3 and
4x4 MIMO systems the code rate is Rc=1/2.
The MIMO wireless flat fading channel is realized as
given in [31]. A system with NT transmit antennae and NR
receive antennae is considered. It is assumed that the
complex channel gain hi,j is a complex Gaussian random
variable: hi,j~Nc(0,1). As the MIMO channel matrix H is
not known for the receiver, it must be estimated before the
start of the decoding process. The channel estimation
method based on the optimal training preamble [31] is
adopted. OSTB decoding, 64-QAM demodulation and error
correction decoding are carried out.
Using the above-mentioned simulation model of the
Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding (OSTBC) MIMO
system, different experiments were performed to estimate
the BER as a function of the SIR. Four types of systems are
considered: SISO (1x1), MIMO (2x2), MIMO (3x3) and
MIMO (4x4). The MIMO channels are subject to flat fading
and, in addition, background AWGN is applied, so that the
signal to AWGN ratio at the input of the OFDM receiver is
15dB. In Figure 11, a complex flat fading AWNG channel
without NBI suppression is considered. The SIR is varied
from -20 dB to 0 dB. It can be seen that 4x4 OSTBC MIMO
system gives the best performance.

Three NBI suppression techniques are then applied: FE,
FIC, and the new NBI adaptive filtering method.
In the case of 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 MIMO channels
(Figures 12, 13 and 14) better results in terms of NBI
filtering are obtained for higher values of antenna diversity.
The FE method manifests good performance for high SIR.

The experimental results show that the frequency
identification and cancellation method achieves the highest
performance. On the other hand, the extremely high
computational complexity limits its application in terms of
hardware resources. In this respect, the adaptive notch filter
turns out to be the optimal NBI suppression scheme, as it
offers very good performance and reasonable computational
complexity.
The
frequency
excision
method
shows
relatively good results and its main advantage is its
computational efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper a method for NBI suppression in MIMO
MB-OFDM UWB communication systems, using adaptive
complex narrowband filtering, is proposed. In relation to
this, a comparison with two other schemes for suppression
of complex NBI is performed. The first is a frequency
excision method while the second employs frequency
identification and cancellation based on ML and NLS
algorithms. The experiments show that for high NBI, where
the SIR is less than 0 dB, all three suppression methods lead
to a significant improvement in performance.
An optimal solution is the adaptive narrowband filtering
method, which offers a trade-off between outstanding NBI
suppression efficiency and computational complexity. An
alternative approach is to implement a combination of the
NBI filtering and frequency cancellation methods, thus
improving overall performance.
