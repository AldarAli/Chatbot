Abstract— This paper proposes a spectrum enforcement 
framework by mobile, crowdsourced agents, who work in 
collaboration with a trustworthy infrastructure. To address the 
scarcity of spectrum, the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) mandated dynamic sharing of spectrum among the 
different tiers of users. The success of spectrum sharing, 
however, relies on the automated enforcement of spectrum 
policies. While most works in the past focus on automating 
spectrum enforcement before an actual harm has occurred, we 
focus on ex post spectrum enforcement, which happens 
during/after the occurrence of a potentially harmful event, but 
before/after an actual harm has occurred. The chief challenge 
here is to ensure efficient ex post enforcement. In order to 
achieve this, we focus on attaining maximum coverage of the 
region of enforcement, ensuring reliable and accurate detection 
of violation, and exploring a methodology to select qualified 
crowdsourced agents, called volunteers. We ensure maximum 
coverage of the given area of enforcement by proposing to divide 
it into regions using the Lloyd’s algorithm and solving the 
enforcement problem by a divide and conquer mechanism over 
the entire area. We determine qualification of volunteers based 
on their likelihood of being in a region, over a given time interval 
and on trust, which is based on their behavior over the past.  
Finally, we use a non-incentive-based algorithm to select 
qualified volunteers for every region in the given area. We 
simulate the enforcement framework in CSIM19 (C++ version) 
and analyze the performance of the proposed volunteer selection 
algorithm over the area of enforcement.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
With the exponential increase in use of wireless services, 
the demand for additional spectrum is steadily on the rise. In 
order to address this potential spectrum scarcity problem, the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed 
Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), wherein licensed 
frequency bands when idle, are utilized by unlicensed users. 
In April 2015, the FCC adopted a three-tiered spectrum 
sharing infrastructure that is administered and enforced by 
Spectrum Access System (SAS) [1]. This architecture 
consists of Incumbents in tier 1, Priority Access Licensed 
(PAL) devices in tier 2 and General Authorized Access 
(GAA) devices in tier 3. Incumbents, in general, include 
military radars, fixed satellite service Earth stations and 
several of the Wireless Broadband Services (3650 – 3700 
MHz) [2]. The SAS ensures that the spectrum is always 
available to the incumbent users when and where needed. The 
next level of access is provided to the users who buy PAL for 
a given location and period of time (usually for a three-year 
term). The remaining spectrum can then be used by devices 
having GAA. These devices have no protection from 
interference. They must, however, protect incumbents and 
PALs, while accessing spectrum [2].  
As spectrum sharing becomes more intense and more 
granular with more stakeholders, we can expect an increasing 
number of potentially enforceable events. Thus, the success 
of spectrum sharing systems is dependent on our ability to 
automate their enforcement. The three key aspects of any 
enforcement regime are: the timing of enforcement action, 
the form of enforcement sanction and whether the 
enforcement action is private or public [3]. This paper 
focuses on detection of spectrum misuse. Thus, the key aspect 
of enforcement action for our consideration, is the timing of 
enforcement. Timing of an enforcement can be either ex ante 
(before a potentially “harmful” action has occurred) or ex 
post (after a potentially “harmful” action has occurred, but 
potentially before or after an actual “harm” has been done) 
[4]. The ex ante and ex post enforcement effects are 
inextricably linked. For example, if the ex ante rules and 
processes are sufficiently strong then ex post harms may be 
prevented before they occur. Also, certain types of ex ante 
rules may be easier to monitor and hence lower the cost of 
enforcement. Even strong ex ante rules may require ex post 
enforcement; for example, licensing approval for equipment 
is usually based on a prototype or pre-production unit, but 
compliance of production units may require some kind of 
policing. Till date, more significance has been given on 
automating ex ante enforcement of usage rights. As an 
example, the TV White Spaces database systems essentially

work by preventing users with subordinate rights from using 
spectrum when and where other users with superior rights are 
operating [5]. This concept has been extended in the new 
Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) to a SAS that is 
designed to distinguish the three classes of user types 
discussed previously [2]. 
We observe that both SAS and CBRS have well-developed 
mechanisms to avoid interference but provide no support for 
addressing interference when it occurs. As we consider ex 
post enforcement approaches, the need to detect enforceable 
events, gather information about these events and adjudicate 
claims based on rules and evidence becomes important. In 
this paper, we focus on the detection of an interference event, 
or RF signal energy that is caused by a malicious user. The 
primary challenge is to ensure efficient ex post spectrum 
enforcement. In order to address this challenge, this paper 
proposes an enforcement framework that aims to achieve a) 
maximum coverage of the entire area of enforcement, b) an 
accurate, reliable and feasible detection of an event of 
violation, c) use of an effective method for hiring and 
deploying detecting agents. By employing a hybrid 
infrastructure of crowdsourced and trusted, dedicated 
resources, we aim to ensure “optimal” detection of spectrum 
access violation in Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Wireless 
networks. The major contributions of this paper are: 
a) Region Coverage: We use a clustering algorithm to 
organize the area into smaller sized “regions” in 
order to ensure more manageable detection of 
violation  
b) Crowdsourced Detection: We explore a mechanism 
to select crowdsourced detecting agents (called 
volunteers) for ensuring that a spectrum violation is 
detected with high probability of accuracy and 
efficiency. 
c) Volunteer Selection: We develop a framework to 
assess the qualification of a volunteer across two 
dimensions - location likelihood and trust, to select 
volunteers using a non-incentive-based algorithm to 
ensure “optimal” quality of spectrum enforcement. 
 
The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 
III of the paper discusses about the enforcement framework. 
Section IV discusses about the crowdsourced monitoring 
methodology, with a focus on the parameters that qualify a 
volunteer for selection and the appropriate volunteer 
selection mechanism. Section V discusses about the 
experimental setup and the results we obtained from applying 
the proposed volunteer selection algorithm. Finally, we 
conclude the paper and discuss about future works in Section 
VI.

RELATED WORKS 
Jin et al. [20] introduces the first crowdsourced spectrum 
misuse detection for DSA systems. Dutta and Chiang [13] 
discusses about crowdsourced spectrum enforcement for 
accurate detection and location of spectrum enforcement. 
Salama et al. [22] proposed an optimal channel assignment 
framework for crowdsourced spectrum monitoring, where 
volunteers are assigned to monitor channels based on their 
availability patterns and are awarded with incentives in 
return. Li et al. [23] models the spectrum misuse problem as 
a combinatorial multi armed bandit problem to decide which 
channels to monitor, how long to monitor each channel, and 
the order in which channels should be monitored. Several 
incentive-based crowdsourced spectrum sensing works have 
been done over the past few years. Yang et al. [7] studied two 
incentive based crowdsourcing models, where a Stackelberg 
Equilibrium was computed in the platform-centric model, 
and a truthful auction mechanism was proposed under the 
user-centric model. Zhu et al. [14] proposes an incentive-
based auction mechanism to improve fairness of bids by 
taking into consideration the effects of malicious competition 
behavior 
and 
the 
“free-riding” 
phenomenon 
in 
crowdsourcing services. Lin et al. [6] takes the Sybil attack 
into consideration for incentive based crowdsourced 
spectrum sensing. The works [11] and [12] propose 
frameworks for crowdsourced spectrum sensing without 
violating the location privacy of mobile users. Contrary to the 
formerly proposed spectrum monitoring approaches, which 
rely exclusively either on large deployment of physical 
monitoring infrastructure [8]-[10] or on crowdsourcing, we 
believe that spectrum misuse and access rights violations can 
be effectively prevented by using trusted infrastructure, 
composed of a central DSA Enforcement Infrastructure and a 
minimal number of mobile, wireless devices with advanced 
trust and authentication capabilities, augmented with an 
opportunistic infrastructure of wireless devices with various 
software and hardware capabilities. Moreover, in contrast to 
the usual methodologies, we explore the use of a non-
incentive-based methodology for selection of volunteers to 
ensure maximum coverage of enforcement area and accurate 
detection of spectrum violations. 
III. 
ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK 
The main challenge in the design of a hybrid infrastructure 
stems from the fact that it is not easy to determine where and 
how the resources are to be mobilized, given the non-
deterministic nature of mobile devices’ behavior. It is equally 
difficult to determine how collaboration between these 
devices must take place to ensure swift detection and response 
to spectrum misuse and access rights violation. To address 
this, we broadly follow a crowdsourced monitoring 
infrastructure, supported by sentinel-based monitoring and a 
central DSA Enforcement Infrastructure. 
A. System Model 
The entire area of enforcement R is divided into smaller 
regions, with an Access Point 𝐴𝑃𝑟, associated with every 𝑟𝜖𝑅. 
Authorized users, who are legitimate Secondary Users (SUs) 
gain access to an available channel through the local 𝐴𝑃𝑟 in 
𝑟. On the contrary, malicious users are unauthorized 
75

transmitters who intrude on spectrum by illegitimately using 
spectrum frequencies in 𝑟 that they have not been authorized 
to use by the local 𝐴𝑃𝑟. Some of the authorized users 
volunteer to monitor a given channel for access violation, in 
addition to accessing the spectrum to transmit their own data. 
Such volunteers are mobile agents who can monitor radio 
access behavior within their neighborhood and detect 
anomalous use of spectrum. To carry out spectrum 
monitoring practices, volunteers incur transmit power 
consumption cost and bandwidth consumption cost.  
As shown in Figure 1, the system model further consists 
of a central DSA Enforcement Infrastructure, which consists 
of a set of Volunteer Service units 𝑉𝑆𝑟 for every 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅, a 
Volunteer Selection Unit and a DSA Database. A volunteer 
𝑣𝜖𝑉 in 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅 registers itself to the 𝑉𝑆𝑟 associated with 𝑟. A 
𝑉𝑆𝑟 stores and updates volunteer attributes over the entire 
period of enforcement. The Volunteer Selection Unit uses the 
latest attributes of all the volunteers in a 𝑉𝑆𝑟 to select 
volunteers for monitoring a given channel in 𝑟 over the next 
epoch of enforcement. The DSA Database maintains a 
channel-user occupancy list, for the entire area of 
enforcement 𝑅. The information contained in the DSA 
Database is used to identify the channels and their respective 
authorized users in 𝑅. Finally, the system model consists of a 
set of sentinels 𝑆′ who monitor a given channel in 𝑟 at random 
intervals to verify the detection results reported by the 
volunteers and to prevent selection of volunteers who have 
unreliable behavior. 
B. Coverage of Region 
To ensure maximum coverage of an area 𝑅 for 
enforcement, we follow a divide and conquer method. We 
propose to divide the entire area 𝑅 into smaller regions and 
then focus on solving the enforcement problem for a single 
region 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅. This in turn can be used for solving the problem 
for the whole 𝑅. For division of 𝑅 into regions, we propose 
the employment of the Voronoi algorithm [15]. Initially, we 
assume that the volunteers in 𝑉 are randomly distributed over 
𝑅 and the access points are spread uniformly over  𝑅. For 
each 
volunteer 
𝑣 ∈ 𝑉, 
its 
corresponding 
Voronoi 
region 𝑟 consists of every volunteer in the Euclidean plane 
whose distance to the local 𝐴𝑃𝑟 is less than or equal to its 
distance to any other 𝐴𝑃𝑟 [15]. However, the Voronoi 
algorithm may not produce regions that are of equal size. This 
is a disadvantage because it may result in some of the regions 
to have an undersupply of volunteers over time, which in turn 
may result in possible loss in detection of spectrum violation. 
Thus, we propose to apply a relaxation to the Voronoi 
algorithm, called the Lloyd’s Algorithm [16], which 
produces uniformly sized convex regions, and thus improves 
the probability of a fair distribution of volunteers over all 
regions. The number of regions in 𝑅 is equal to the number 
of access points in 𝑅.  
IV. 
CROWDSOURCED SPECTRUM MONITORING 
A volunteer 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 is associated with the following 
parameters:  Serial Number of the sensing device 𝑆𝑣 used by 
𝑣 and its location 𝐿𝑣,𝑡 at time 𝑡. While 𝑆𝑣 can be used to 
uniquely identify a volunteer, the location 𝐿𝑣,𝑡 allows the 𝑉𝑆𝑟 
of the DSA Enforcement Infrastructure to estimate whether 𝑣 
will be available to monitor a given channel in 𝑟 in the future.  
As shown in Figure 2, we divide the total enforcement 
time into a set of intervals called the Monitoring Intervals, 
MIs. Each MI is further divided into a set of 𝑛 sub-intervals 
called the Access Unit Intervals (AUIs). One AUI is defined 
as the smallest interval over which a user, intruder or 
legitimate, can accomplish useful work.  It is used as the 
interference monitoring interval by the selected volunteers to 
determine access violation or legitimacy. A new set of 
volunteers is selected at the end of every MI by the Volunteer 
Service unit 𝑉𝑆𝑟 associated with region 𝑟. Volunteer selection 
in 𝑟 is primarily based upon twofold parameters of trust and 
location likelihood of a 𝑣 in 𝑟. 
A. Trust 
The trust of a volunteer 𝑣 is determined by its past 
behavior. The behavior of a volunteer 𝑣 is chiefly determined 
by its accuracy in detection of spectrum violation. At the end 
of every AUI 𝑖, a volunteer 𝑣 reports the observed state 𝛷𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 
of a channel 𝑐𝑟 that it monitors, over 𝑖. The state of a channel 
𝑐𝑟 can be either a) violated, when 𝑐𝑟 is being used by a 
malicious transmitter b) not violated, when 𝑐𝑟 is either idle, 
i.e., when no user, authorized or malicious, uses 𝑐𝑟 or safe, 
i.e., when 𝑐𝑟 is used by an authorized transmitter. The 
necessary ground truth required for calculating accuracy of 
interference detection by 𝑣 in 𝑟 is acquired from the observed 
state 𝛷𝑗,𝑠,𝑟 of 𝑐𝑟 by a sentinel 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆′ that monitors 𝑐𝑟 at a 
random AUI 𝑗. A sentinel 𝑠 is a trustworthy agent who helps 
in verifying volunteer detection result and helps to identify

unreliable volunteers. As shown in Figure 2, a sentinel 𝑠 
monitors 𝑐𝑟 in 𝑟 at a random interval 𝑗,which is not known to 
the volunteers. This helps us to calculate the behavior 𝑏𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 of 
𝑣 in 𝑟 at AUI 𝑖 by using (1) given below. 
 
 
𝑏𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 = {1,
𝛷𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 = 𝛷𝑗,𝑠,𝑟
0,
𝛷𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 ≠ 𝛷𝑗,𝑠,𝑟 , ∀𝑖 = 𝑗 
(1) 
 
As shown in (1), the behavior of a volunteer 𝑏𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 at 𝑖 in 𝑟 
is assigned to zero when there is a mismatch in the observed 
state of 𝑐𝑟, between 𝑣 and 𝑠.This can be because a) 𝑣 makes 
a false detection, b) 𝑣 lies about the true result, or c) 𝑠 makes 
a false detection, d) 𝑠 lies about the true result. However, for 
this paper, we assume that 𝑠 is trustworthy and never makes 
a false detection or lies about a true result. An AUI when both 
𝑣 and 𝑠 monitor channel 𝑐𝑟 is called a matching interval. We 
aggregate 𝑏𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 over all the matching intervals to find the trust 
𝑇𝑣,𝑟 of 𝑣 in 𝑟, by calculating the arithmetic mean 𝑇𝑣,𝑟, given 
by (2), 
 
 
𝑇𝑣,𝑟 = 1
𝑚 ∑ 𝑏𝑝,𝑣,𝑟
𝑚
𝑝=1
 
(2) 
 
where 𝑝 is a matching interval and 𝑚 is the total number of 
matching intervals over all the monitoring intervals observed 
so far. 
 
B. Location Likelihood 
In order to efficiently support detection of channel 
violation in a region 𝑟, volunteers who are most likely to 
reside a major proportion of time in 𝑟 after a visit to 𝑟, must 
be given preference. For this purpose, the 𝑉𝑆𝑟 estimates the 
fraction of time that a volunteer 𝑣 stays in 𝑟 after its current 
visit to 𝑟. As shown in Figure 3, after the (𝑗)𝑡ℎ visit of 𝑣 to 𝑟, 
we measure its (𝑗 − 1)𝑡ℎ sojourn time, 𝑆𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟, in 𝑟 as the 
difference between its (𝑗 − 1)𝑡ℎ departure time, 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟  
from 𝑟 and its (𝑗 − 1)𝑡ℎ arrival time, 𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 in 𝑟. 
Furthermore, we calculate the (𝑗 − 1)𝑡ℎ return time of 𝑣 in 𝑟, 
𝑅𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟, as the difference between 𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 and 𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟. As 
given by (3), this enables us to calculate the proportion of 
time, 𝑃𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟,  that 𝑣 resided in 𝑟 on its previous ((𝑗 − 1)𝑡ℎ) 
visit to 𝑟, as the ratio of 𝑆𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 to 𝑅𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟. Based on this 
information, the 𝑉𝑆𝑟 estimates the proportion of time that 𝑣 
is likely to stay in 𝑟 before its 𝑗𝑡ℎ departure from 𝑟, as an 
exponentially smoothed average, given by (4). 
 
 
𝑃𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 = 𝑆𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟
𝑅𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟
 
(3) 
 
 
𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 = 𝛼. 𝑃𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 + (1 −  𝛼). 𝑃̃𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟. 
(4) 
 
In order to estimate the smoothed average, 𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 more 
accurately, smoothing factor 𝛼 is computed as: 
 
 
 
𝛼 = 𝑐
𝐸𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟
2
𝜎𝑗,𝑣,𝑟
 . 
(5) 
 
where 
0 < 𝑐 < 1, 
𝐸𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 = 𝑃𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 − 𝑃̃𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 
is 
the 
prediction error, and 𝜎𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 is the average of the past square 
prediction errors on visit 𝑗. 𝜎𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 can be expressed as follows: 
 
 
𝜎𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 = 𝑐. 𝐸𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟
2
+ (1 −  𝑐). 𝜎𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟. 
(6) 
 
Moreover, at any given time 𝑡, the location 𝐿𝑣,𝑡 of 
volunteer 𝑣 enables us to estimate the likelihood of  𝑣 to stay 
in 𝑟 over the next monitoring interval, MI, based on the 
assumption that the likelihood of 𝑣 to stay in 𝑟 decreases as 
the displacement between 𝐿𝑣,𝑡  and the centroid 𝑂𝑟 of 𝑟 
increases. This is expressed by the separation factor, 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟, 
given by (7) as follows: 
 
 
𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 = 𝛾1𝑒−𝛾2𝑑(𝐿𝑣,𝑡,𝑂𝑟). 
(7) 
 
where 0 < 𝛾1, 𝛾2 < 1, are parameters defined by the system 
and 𝑑(𝐿𝑣,𝑡, 𝑂𝑟) is the displacement between 𝐿𝑣,𝑡and 𝑂𝑟. Since 
𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 is exponential, so we empirically select values of 𝛾1 and 
 𝛾2 to avoid high variance in the values of 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 across all the 
volunteers. 
Hence, the location likelihood, 𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of 𝑣 in 𝑟 at time 
𝑡 over the next 𝑀𝐼, is given by a function 𝑓 of the parameters, 
𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 of the latest (𝑗𝑡ℎ) visit of 𝑣 in 𝑟 and 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟,. We observe 
 
Figure 2. Observations Φ𝑖,𝑣,𝑟 by volunteer 𝑣 after every AUI and Φ𝑗,𝑠,𝑟 by 
sentinel 𝑠 after random AUIs, for the 1st MI.

that since 𝑅𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 > 𝑆𝑗−1,𝑣,𝑟 and 0 < 𝛼 < 1, so 0 < 𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 <
1. Similarly, since 𝑑(𝐿𝑣,𝑡, 𝑂𝑟) ≥ 0, so 0 < 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 ≤ 1. As 
weighting the parameters by linear regression requires large 
amount of data and preferential weighting is hard to establish 
as it usually requires an expert opinion on the importance of 
an individual parameter relative to the overall composite 
parameter [17], so we assign equal weights to the parameters 
𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 and 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟. Finally, we define function 𝑓 as the product 
of parameters 𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟 and 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 as given by (8) below.  
 
 
𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) = 𝑃̃𝑗,𝑣,𝑟  × 𝛶𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 
(8) 
C. Selection of volunteers 
From the set of volunteers, 𝑉, in total area of enforcement, 
𝑅, the 𝑉𝑆𝑟 associated with 𝑟 in the DSA Enforcement 
Infrastructure selects 𝑘𝑟 qualified volunteers to monitor 𝑟 at 
the beginning of every MI. This is determined by the 
estimated Qualification 𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of a volunteer 𝑣 to monitor 
the associated channel 𝑐𝑟 in 𝑟 over the next MI, given by (9), 
defined below.  
   
 
 𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) = 𝑔(𝑇𝑣,𝑟,  𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼)) 
(9) 
 
As shown in (9), 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of a 𝑣 in 𝑟 is 
given as a function 𝑔 of its location likelihood 𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼), over 
the next MI, and trust 𝑇𝑣,𝑟. Since 𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) and 𝑇𝑣,𝑟 represent 
the measurement of two different parameters, we normalize 
both the parameters by using the min-max normalization 
technique [17]. We apply equal weighting to the two 
parameters since the other two widely used weighting 
methods of linear regression and preferential weighting are 
cumbersome due to the requirement of large amount of data 
and of expert opinion on preference, respectively [17]. We 
aggregate 𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) and 𝑇𝑣,𝑟 in function 𝑔, using a) 
multiplication, b) addition, c) geometric mean, d) arithmetic 
mean and compare the performance of using different 
aggregation methods in Section V. 
This work focuses on spectrum enforcement over a single 
channel in a region. However, it can be extended to deal with 
multiple channels in a region by selecting volunteers to cover 
additional channels. We also assume that a volunteer 𝑣 can 
be hired to monitor more than one region over the next MI as 
𝑣 is mobile and can potentially cover multiple regions over a 
given MI. The Volunteer Selection Unit of the DSA 
Enforcement Infrastructure builds a centralized ||𝑉||-by-
||𝑅|| matrix Ψ𝑉,𝑅, using the values of volunteer attributes 
from the 𝑉𝑆𝑟 associated with every region 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅. The matrix 
Ψ𝑉,𝑅 is a volunteer-region qualification matrix that contains 
the qualification values  𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of all 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 for every 𝑟 ∈
𝑅. The Volunteer Selection Unit selects 𝑘𝑟 volunteers 
dynamically from 𝑉 based on the qualification values of all 
𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 for 𝑟, using Algorithm 1. 
For the volunteer selection Algorithm 1, we use the 
volunteer-region qualification matrix Ψ𝑉,𝑅 to select qualified 
volunteers for every 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅 (line 1). At the end of a MI (line 
3), the Volunteer Selection Unit gains access to the 
qualification values of all 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 for 𝑟 from Ψ𝑉,𝑅 and stores 
them in a list 𝑄𝑟 (line 4). If the number of volunteers to be 
selected in 𝑟, 𝑘𝑟 is 1, then we use the classic secretary 
algorithm [18] to select the most qualified volunteer 
dynamically, with constant probability. In a classic secretary 
algorithm, we observe the first ||𝑄𝑟||/𝑒 qualification values 
to determine a threshold and then select the first of the 
remaining volunteers, whose qualification value is above the 
threshold [19]. However, if 𝑘𝑟 > 1, we select volunteers 
dynamically by using a variant of the multiple-choice 
secretary algorithm, which proceeds as follows. We draw a 
random 
sample 
𝑚𝑟 
from 
a 
binomial 
distribution 
𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙(||𝑄𝑟||,
1
2), from which we select up to ⌊𝑘𝑟/2⌋ 
volunteers recursively (lines 8-13). We keep appending the 
selected volunteers in set 𝑉𝑆,𝑟. If 𝑚𝑟 is greater than ⌊𝑘𝑟/2⌋, 
then we set 𝑙𝑟 to ⌊𝑘𝑟/2⌋, otherwise we set 𝑙𝑟 to 𝑚𝑟. Next, we 
set a 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑, which is the 𝑙𝑟
𝑡ℎ largest qualification value 
in the sample of first 𝑚𝑟 qualification values. After this, we 
select every volunteer with qualification value greater than  
𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑, till we select a maximum of 𝑘𝑟 volunteers (lines 
16-20) [19]. We apply this algorithm for selection of 
volunteers in every 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅. The expected total qualification 
value of the 𝑘𝑟 volunteers selected by Algorithm 1 is at least  
(1 −
5
√𝑘𝑟) times the total qualification value of the top 𝑘𝑟 
volunteers [19].

divide the entire area of enforcement 𝑅 (of total area 500,000 
sq. units) into two regions of equal area. This work can, 
however, be easily extended to deal with more regions. With 
the assumption that 1 sq. unit is equivalent to 1 sq. meter and 
by taking the average population density of Pittsburgh 
(2,140/sq. km) [21], we calculate the total population (1,070 
people) in the area of enforcement. A random fraction of 
people from the total population are chosen as volunteers 
(equals 183 volunteers). Volunteers are initially placed at 
random positions within 𝑅 and they change their positions 
with a random speed from the range 0-70 m/s at a random 
direction after every fixed interval of time. The maximum 
speed of a volunteer is chosen higher than the usual speed 
limit of a vehicle in a city in order to compensate for the 
limited simulation time. Additionally, we assume that every 
volunteer uses a sensing device with maximum battery 
capacity of approximately 7 Wh and that the battery 
discharges at the rate of 1 J/s for a random time interval drawn 
from an exponential distribution of the mean active time 
interval of 100 s. After every active time interval, we assume 
that the device remains idle for a random time interval drawn 
from an exponential distribution of the mean idle time 
interval of 10 s. The simulation runs till the battery of the 
sensing device used by every volunteer is exhausted, i.e., for 
5665 AUIs. Each AUI is equivalent to 5 seconds and one MI 
is equivalent to 5 AUIs. We select 𝛾1 = 1 and 𝛾2 = 0.01 for 
the separation factor Υ𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 of 𝑣 with respect to 𝑟. Since  Υ𝑡,𝑣,𝑟 
is exponential, so we empirically decide the value of the 𝛾2, 
which is the coefficient of d(𝐿𝑣,𝑡, 𝑂𝑟) from (7), to avoid high 
variances in the qualification values of volunteers. Since we 
did not notice significant difference in the results for different 
values of 𝛼, we determine the value of 𝛼 empirically as 0.1 
for the sake of simplicity in implementation. Finally, we 
assume that 𝑘𝑟 = 𝑘 for every 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅. 
Primarily, we evaluate two performance metrics – the hit 
ratio and the accuracy of detection. In a monitoring interval 
MI, if a volunteer 𝑣 selected for monitoring 𝑟 is in 𝑟 at the 
beginning of an AUI in the given MI, then it is a hit, otherwise 
it is a miss for the AUI in the given MI. This is according to 
the assumption that a selected volunteer 𝑣 can successfully 
monitor a channel 𝑐𝑟 in 𝑟 over an AUI only if 𝑣 resides in 𝑟 
over the given AUI. The hit ratio of a region 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅 over a 
given MI measures the ratio of the number of hits of all the 
selected volunteers to the sum of the number of hits and the 
number of misses of all the selected volunteers in 𝑟. Figure 5 
compares the mean hit ratio of all the regions over the entire 
duration of simulation, by using the proposed Algorithm 1 
and the Random algorithm for different ranges of 𝑘. The 
Random algorithm selects k volunteers randomly from the 
total set of volunteers 𝑉. For this experiment, the 
qualification 𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of a volunteer 𝑣 for region 𝑟 is equal 
to its location likelihood 𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼). We observe that 
Algorithm 1 has a better mean hit ratio than the random 
algorithm for all the ranges of 𝑘. However, the mean hit ratio 
by applying Algorithm 1 decreases consistently (from 0.91 
for 𝑘 =1-20% of ||𝑉|| to 0.57 for 𝑘 = 20-40% of ||𝑉||) with 
the increase in 𝑘 because the proportion of qualified selected 
volunteers reduces as the value of 𝑘 increases.  The error bars 
in Figure 5 represent the mean standard deviation of the mean 
hit ratio across all regions, which decreases from 0.22 for 𝑘 
=1-20% of ||𝑉|| to 0.101 for 𝑘 = 80-100% of ||𝑉||, using 
Algorithm 1 and decreases from 0.19 for 𝑘 =1-20% of ||𝑉|| 
to 0.06 for 𝑘 = 80-100% of ||𝑉||, using the Random 
algorithm. This type of behavior is attributed to the fact that 
a balance is approached between the proportions of qualified 
and unqualified selected volunteers as the value of 𝑘 
increases. 
We assume that every volunteer monitors the channel in 
𝑟 with a probability of successful detection 𝑝𝑣, drawn 
randomly from a uniform distribution in the range of 0 + 𝛿 
to 0.5 + 𝛿 (with 𝛿 = 0.1) and that a sentinel in 𝑟 monitors 
the channel with the probability of successful detection of

0.5. The observed detection value of a 𝑣 at the end of an AUI 
is a random sample taken from a binomial distribution of 100 
trials with a probability of success equal to 𝑝𝑣. Similarly, the 
observed detection value of a sentinel 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆′ at the end of an 
AUI is a random sample from a binomial distribution of 100 
trials with a probability of success equal to 0.5. If the 
observed detection values of a 𝑣 and 𝑠 in 𝑟 are both either 
greater than or lesser than an empirically selected threshold 
value of 42, then the detection by 𝑣 is considered accurate. 
Figure 6 compares the mean accuracy of detection of the 
selected volunteers over all the MIs between Algorithm 1 and 
the Random algorithm for varying ranges of 𝑘. For this 
experiment, the qualification 𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of a volunteer 𝑣 for 
region 𝑟 is equal to its trust 𝑇𝑣,𝑟. We observe that Algorithm 
1 performs better than the Random algorithm for all the 
ranges of 𝑘. The mean accuracy of detection decreases 
consistently (from 0.92 for 𝑘 = 1-20% of ||𝑉|| to 0.403 for 𝑘 
= 80-100% of ||𝑉||) with the increase in 𝑘 because of the 
decrease in the fraction of qualified volunteers in 𝑟 as 𝑘 
increases. The uniform distribution of 𝑝𝑣 for all 𝑣𝜖𝑉 ensures 
that the mean standard deviation in accuracy of detection 
across all regions decreases from 0.103 for 𝑘 =1-20% of ||𝑉|| 
to 0.069 for 𝑘 = 80-100% of ||𝑉||, using Algorithm 1 and 
decreases from 0.13 for 𝑘 =1-20% of ||𝑉|| to 0.05 for 𝑘 = 80-
100% of ||𝑉||, using the Random algorithm.  
Finally, in Figure 7, we compare the mean hit ratio and 
the mean accuracy of detection by using different data 
aggregation methods to aggregate the trust 𝑇𝑣,𝑟 and location 
likelihood 𝐿𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) of 𝑣 to calculate it’s qualification 
𝑄𝑣,𝑟(𝑀𝐼) using (9) for region 𝑟 over the next MI. For this 
experiment, we select volunteers using Algorithm 1 for 𝑘 = 
1-20% of ||𝑉||. We observe that by using the aggregation 
methods of sum and arithmetic mean, we obtain a mean 
accuracy value (equals 0.86) higher than the mean hit ratio 
(equals 0.76). On the contrary, we observe that the mean 
accuracy value (equals 0.78) is lower than the mean hit ratio 
(equals 0.85) when we use the data aggregation methods of 
product and geometric mean. Also, we observe that the 
results we obtain by using sum and arithmetic mean are 
similar. Likewise, we get similar results for both product and 
geometric mean. This would help us to decide about the 
proper aggregation method to use based on the requirements 
of the system for efficient spectrum enforcement.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we discuss about a spectrum enforcement 
framework 
based 
on 
a 
crowdsourced 
monitoring 
infrastructure, supported by sentinel-based monitoring and a 
central DSA Enforcement Infrastructure. The objective is to 
maximize coverage of the area of enforcement and to ensure 
reliable detection of spectrum access violation by selecting 
qualified volunteers. We propose to maximize the coverage of 
the region of enforcement by following a divide-and-conquer 
mechanism wherein we divide the area of enforcement into 
smaller regions, by applying the Lloyd’s algorithm, which is 
a relaxation to the Voronoi algorithm. Every small region in 
the enforcement area is responsible for its own spectrum 
enforcement, which in turn ensures enforcement of the entire 
area. The qualification of a volunteer for the upcoming time 
interval is decided by its likelihood to stay in the region over 
the next monitoring interval and by its trust. We use a variant 
of the multiple-choice Secretary algorithm to select volunteers 
dynamically based on their qualifications to monitor a region. 
We observe that this non-incentive-based volunteer selection 
algorithm performs better than a non-incentive-based 
algorithm that selects volunteers randomly for spectrum 
monitoring. 
We plan to extend this work to explore different 
mechanisms to select volunteers for multi-channel spectrum 
enforcement. We further plan to explore different statistical 
and machine learning based mechanisms to determine the 
trust and location likelihood of volunteers in the enforcement 
area.
