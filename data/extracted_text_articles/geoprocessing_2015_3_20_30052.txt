Abstract—Recently, the number of natural disasters has 
increased due to abnormal changes in the weather in Korea. A 
storm and flood insurance system is available to prevent fallout 
from these natural disasters. The national storm and flood 
insurance premium rates are very low and the risk of adverse 
selection exists because the system is based exclusively on those 
who live in high-risk areas. To solve these problems, a storm 
and flood insurance premium rate map is required. In this 
paper, we investigate domestic and foreign storm and flood 
insurance maps and extract the common elements of these 
storm and flood insurance maps. We also created a prototype 
storm and flood insurance premium rate map of Ulsan in 
Korea. 
Keywords-natural disaster; hazard risk; insurance map; GIS;

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent widespread flooding and other extreme weather 
events have caused devastating losses across Korea. These 
losses have been borne by individuals and businesses, local 
governments, community organizations, the by Korean 
government. For this reason, the Korean government has 
developed a storm and flood insurance system which pays 
benefits in the event of this type of damage [1]. This system 
was introduced in 2006 to protect businesses and residences 
from the effects of natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, 
torrential rain, gales, heavy seas, tidal waves, heavy 
snowfalls and earthquakes, as well as tsunamis, as shown in 
Fig. 1 [2]. The storm and flood insurance system is managed 
by the National Emergency Management Agency in Korea 
and is administered by private insurance companies. The 
central (59.5%) and local (25.5%) governments offer partial 
subsidies for the insurance premiums of customers (15%) to 
make them more capable of coping with unexpected storms 
and floods [3]. 
Generally, 
standard 
insurance premium 
rates 
are 
rationally graded or applied according to the magnitude of the 
risk (the degree of risk). However, present storm and flood 
insurance in Korea applies the same insurance premium rate 
regardless of the risk or district, using only one risk grade all 
230 cities covered [4]. Therefore, the current insurance 
premium rate is unfairly discriminatory, as it is supposed to 
be graded and applied in the standard manner of insurance 
premium rates based on the level of risk [5]. For example, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a), the same insurance premium rate is 
applied despite the fact that zone A has a lower degree of risk 
than zone B. This study provides a framework for applying 
different insurance rates depending on the risk of the subject-
matter insured, as shown in Fig. 2(b) [4]. 
This paper aims to present spatial data and analysis 
methods to assist the creation process of a storm and flood 
insurance premium rate map. A concurrent aim is to produce 
a pilot map. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II gives a definition of an insurance premium rate 
map and demonstrates how to produce such a map for Ulsan 
in Korea. Section III concludes the paper and summarizes the 
benefits stemming from its results.

INSURANCE PREMIUM RATE MAP 
The storm and flood insurance map is the digital map 
constructed by a computer system as the thematic map that 
represents the risk of damage from storm, flood and snow.

Fig. 3 shows the calculation procedures to determine the 
storm and flood insurance premium rates. Also shown are 
the components of the insurance map. The risk levels of 
three disasters (wind, snow, and water) can be calculated 
through a grid operation. In this study, we used a grid 
resolution of 10m, in accordance with the resolution of the 
DEM (digital elevation model). This work was performed 
with ArcGIS 10.1 [6].  
The completed insurance premium rate map is shown in 
Fig. 4(a), which shows the final map classified into four 
grades – safe, alert, dangerous, and very dangerous – in 
contrast to the existing single premium rate for each of the 
five districts of Ulsan City. 
This map was converted into a KMZ file for the sharing 
of the data. Then, as shown in Fig. 5, insurance premium 
rates on Google Earth could be obtained. The data analysis 
results from the insurance premium rate are also shown 
above the image of the map.

CONCLUSION 
We proposed the storm and flood insurance premium rate 
map. Also we made the prototype storm and flood insurance 
rate map of the Ulsan Korea. In this paper, we were focused 
that GIS-based spatial database was constructed for risk zone 
information about storm and flood damage. It is possible to 
analyze various disasters and to support disaster prediction 
for the future.
