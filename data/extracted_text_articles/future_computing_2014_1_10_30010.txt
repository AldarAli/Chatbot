Abstract—With phenomenal growth of high speed and 
complex computing applications, the design of low power and 
high speed logic circuits have created tremendous interest. 
Reversible computing has emerged as a solution for future 
computing. A number of combinational circuits have been 
developed but the growth of sequential circuits was not 
significant due to feedback and fan-out was not allowed. 
However allowing feedback in space, sequential logic blocks 
have been reported in literature. The target technology is likely 
on quantum computing devices. Reversible flip-flops are the 
most significant and basic memory elements that will be the 
target building block of memory for the forthcoming quantum 
computing devices. This paper proposes a novel reversible gate 
and its quantum realization. The design of reversible flip-flops, 
Serial In Parallel Out (SIPO) shift register and shift counter is 
shown by using our proposed gate and basic reversible gates. 
The proposed design of sequential reversible circuits has 
significant improvement over earlier designs in terms of 
quantum cost and hardware complexity. It is expected that it 
will enhance the growth of sequential reversible circuit. The 
proposed gate is also parity preserving gate. This characteristic 
of the gate may also be useful in fault tolerant sequential 
circuit design.    
Keywords-reversible computing; sequential circuit; flip-flops; 
quantum computation. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Heat dissipation and high power consumption are one of 
the most important issues in the digital circuit design. 
Conventionally, the logic elements are irreversible in nature. 
According to R. Landauer's principle [1], irreversible logic 
computation results in energy dissipation due to heat loss. 
Each bit of information dissipates at least KTln2 energy at 
which the operation is performed. In early 1973, C. H. 
Bennett [2] had shown that the problem of heat dissipation 
of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) circuits can be 
overcome by using reversible logic. Due to this fact, the loss 
of information and consequently dissipation of energy in 
computational operation is significantly lower than 
conventional 
logic. 
Thus, 
reversible 
logic 
and 
its 
applications have spread in various technologies like low 
power 
CMOS 
(Complementary 
Metal-oxide 
Semiconductor) design, optical information processing, 
quantum computing, nanotechnology, etc. 
In the design of reversible logic circuits, research was 
limited to the design of combinational circuits, due to the 
convention that feedback is not allowed in reversible 
computing. However, in one of the well known fundamental 
paper, T. Toffoli [3] has shown that feedback can be 
allowed in reversible computing. According to T. Toffoli,” a 
sequential network is reversible if its combinational part 
(i.e., the combinational network obtained by deleting the 
delay elements and thus breaking the corresponding arcs) is 
reversible.” In 1982, Edward Fredkin [4] has used this 
concept to propose the first design of the reversible 
sequential circuit called the JK latch having the feedback 
loop from the output to input. Recently, A. Banerjee et al. [5] 
have redefined that feedback is allowed in space but not in 
time. Hence, the development of reversible sequential circuits 
has begun. 
In the current literature, the significant work can be 
found on the efficient design of combinational reversible 
circuits such as full adders, BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) 
adders, encoder and multiplexers and several synthesis 
methods have been proposed [6]. In last few years, the 
design of sequential reversible circuits has attracted the 
attention of researchers in the area of optimization and 
synthesis. 
A Reversible Gate is a p-input, p-output (denoted by 
p*p) circuit that produces a unique output pattern for each 
possible input pattern. There is a one to one correspondence 
between the input and output vectors. Any reversible logic 
design should minimize the following optimization 
parameters: 
a) Gate Counts: The total number of gates used in a 
circuit. 
b) Garbage Outputs: These Outputs are not used in 
output functions, but are required to maintain the 
reversibility. The garbage outputs are defined for a circuit 
not for a gate.

c) Constant Inputs: Constants are the input lines that 
are either set to zero or one in the circuit’s input side. 
d) Quantum Cost: Each reversible gate has a cost 
associated with it called the Quantum Cost. The quantum 
cost of a reversible gate is the number of 1×1 and 2×2 
reversible gates or quantum logic gates required in its 
design. The computational complexity of a reversible gate 
can be represented by its quantum cost. The quantum costs 
of all reversible 1×1 and 2×2 gates are taken as unity. 
e) Hardware Complexity: The total number of logic 
operations in a circuit is known as hardware complexity. In 
hardware complexity, the terms are: 
α = A two input EX-OR gate calculation 
β = A two input AND gate calculation 
δ = A NOT calculation 
Basically, it refers to the total number of AND, OR and 
EXOR operation in a circuit. 
However, the gate count is not a good metric of 
optimization as reversible gates are of different type having 
different computational complexity. Hence, the optimization 
of quantum cost is the major metric in the design of 
sequential reversible circuits. A. Banerjee et al. [7] have 
addressed that if a set of reversible quantum gates organized 
in a black box then it can be visualized as a new gate. 
Reduction of these parameters should be the main design 
focus in sequential reversible circuits. The basic reversible 
gates as Toffoli Gate [3] (CCNOT gate), Feynman Gate 
(CNOT Gate) [8] and Fredkin Gate [4] will be used in the 
designing of sequential reversible circuits. 
In this work, we are proposing a novel parity preserving 
reversible gate and its quantum realization by using 
quantum cost optimization algorithm [7]. Further, our 
propose gate is used in the realization of reversible flip-flops 
and shift counter. 
The next sections of this paper are as follows. Section II 
provides the related work in the past. Section III provides the 
details about the proposed reversible gate and its quantum 
realization. Section IV provides reversible design of flip-
flops. The reversible design of SIPO shift register and shift 
counter is described in section V. Section VI has the 
discussion on results. Section VII concludes the work.

RELATED WORK 
In 2005, the first attempt on the design of reversible flip-
flop was H. Thapiyal et al. [9]. In this work, the Fredkin, 
Feynman and New Gate was used as AND, NOT and NOR 
Gate respectively. In the designing of reversible flip-flop, the 
conventional design of a flip-flop was used. In 2006, J. E. 
Rice [10] has proposed all the reversible flip-flops (except R-
S) using R-S latch. For the designing of reversible flip-flops, 
Toffoli and Feynman Gate were used as CCNOT and CNOT 
gate respectively. S. K. S. Hari et al. [11] have addressed 
reversible flip-flops by using basic reversible Fredkin and 
Feynman gates. The reversible flip-flops were proposed by A. 
Banerjee et al. [5] in 2007. For the construction of reversible 
flip-flops, Toffoli gate (CCNOT Gate), Feynman (CNOT 
gate) and NOT were used. A novel concept on the designing 
of reversible flip-flops was proposed by Min-Lun Chuang et 
al. [12] in 2008. In this work, all reversible latches (except 
the SR latch) and their corresponding flip-flops were 
proposed. In 2011, the reversible D flip-flop and shift 
registers [13] and T flip-flop were addressed by V. 
Rajmohan et al. [14]. Two Sayem Gates and one Fredkin 
Gate were used for the designing of reversible T flip-flop.  
At last but not least, in 2012, reversible J-K and D flip-
flop were proposed by Lafifa Jamal et al. [15] using basic 
reversible Fredkin and Double Feynman gates. Recently, the 
design of reversible T flip-flop was proposed by Shubham 
Gupta et al. [16] using a new gate named SVS gate.   
Thus, from a careful survey of the existing works on 
reversible sequential circuits, it can be concluded that most 
of these work considered the optimization of number of 
reversible gates and garbage outputs, while ignoring the 
important parameters of quantum cost and hardware 
complexity.  
Our goal is to describe the quantum realization of the 
proposed reversible gate and optimize the design of 
reversible sequential circuits in terms of all important 
parameters, viz., the gate counts, quantum cost, garbage 
outputs and hardware complexity. Normally, two or three 
parameters are optimized in earlier designs but we have 
considered 
all 
above 
parameters 
shown 
significant 
improvement in most of the cases using our proposed 
reversible gate. The low cost shift counter is also designed 
using the proposed reversible D flip-flop and basic reversible 
gates.

PROPOSED REVERSIBLE PARITY 
PRESERVING GATE AND ITS QUANTUM 
REALIZATION 
The section describes our proposed parity preserve gate 
named “Pareek” gate and its quantum realization. 
A. Proposed Reversible Parity Preserving Gate 
We propose a new 4×4 parity preserve reversible circuit, 
called Pareek gate. The block diagram of the proposed gate is 
shown in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Proposed parity preserving reversible pareek gate 
The truth table of proposed parity preserving Pareek 
Gate is shown in Table I. 
The output P (=A) is copied directly from input A, this 
input to output line is called control line where as other lines 
are called target lines. The gate produces three outputs, 
namely, Q, R and S on target lines as defined in Fig. 1. The 
outputs are verified manually through the truth table.

It is observed that the parity of the input bits is equal to 
the parity of the output bits in each row of the Table I. Hence, 
the gate also preserves the parity. This characteristic can 
further be used in fault tolerant design of reversible sequential 
circuit. However, we propose the low cost design of 
reversible sequential building blocks using this gate. 
B. Quantum Realization of Proposed Gate 
The quantum cost of a reversible gate is the number of 
1×1 and 2×2 reversible gates or quantum logic gates 
required in its design. The computational complexity of a 
reversible gate can be represented by its quantum cost. The 
quantum costs of all reversible 1×1 and 2×2 gates are taken 
as unity. Any reversible gate can be realized using the 1×1 
NOT gate, and 2×2 reversible gates such as Controlled-V 
and Controlled-V+ and the Feynman gate which is also 
known as the Controlled NOT gate (CNOT). Thus, it can 
said that the quantum cost of a reversible gate can be 
calculated by counting the numbers of NOT, Controlled-V, 
Controlled-V+ 
and 
CNOT 
gates 
required 
in 
its 
implementation. The quantum cost of proposed reversible 
gate is calculated by an optimization algorithm [7].

Figure 2.  (c) Optimized quantum realization of proposed gate 
In Fig.2 (a), the proposed Pareek gate is realized using 
one Toffoli gate and four CNOT gates. Then, Toffoli and 
CNOT gates are substituted by quantum primitives and 
moving rule is applied (the movements are shown by 
arrows), so its direct linear cost is (1×5) + (4×1) =9, which 
is shown in Fig.2 (b). New gates are introduced (dashed 
boxes) in Fig.2 (c) to yield quantum cost of Pareek gate as

PROPOSED REVERSIBLE FLIP-FLOPS 
A flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can 
be used to store state information. It is the basic storage 
element in sequence logic. The design of reversible flip-
flops is proposed in this section.

proposed reversible gate. The reversible design is shown in

DESIGN OF PROPOSED REVERSIBLE SIPO 
SHIFT REGISTER & SHIFT REGISTER COUNTER 
The shift register is an indispensable functional device in 
a digital system. A register capable of shifting binary 
information either to the right or to the left is called shift 
register. In a shift register, the flip-flops are connected in 
such a way that the bits of a binary number are entered into 
the shift register, shifted from one position to another and 
finally shifted out. 
Shift register can be arranged to form counters. Shift 
register counters use feedback, whereby the output of the 
last flip-flop in the shift register is connected back to the 
first flip-flop. 
This section provides the reversible design of Serial In 
and Parallel Output (SIPO) shift register and shift register 
counter by using our proposed reversible gate.  
A. Proposed Reversible SIPO Shift Register 
A 4-bit Serial in parallel out shift register consists of one 
serial input, and outputs are taken from all the flip-flops 
parallel. In this register, data is shifted in serially but shifted 
out in parallel. The reversible design of SIPO shift register 
using proposed D flip-flop is shown in Fig. 8.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.  Proposed Realization of Reversible SIPO Shift Register 
The serial input is provided to the SI input of the 
reversible left-most flip-flop while the outputs QA, QB, QC, 
QD are available in parallel from the Q output of the flip- 
flops.

B. Proposed Reversible Shift Counter (Johnson Counter) 
In shift counter, the inverted true output (Q) of the last 
flip-flop is connected back to the serial input of the first flip-
flop. Fig. 9 shows reversible design of shift counter using 
proposed reversible D flip-flop.

DISCUSSION ON RESULTS 
Table 2 to Table 7 shows statistics and comparison of 
our new proposed design of sequential elements against the 
proposed designs by various researchers. We use the 
optimization parameters like gate counts, garbage output, 
constant input, quantum cost and hardware complexity as 
the cost functions to measure the quality of the design.  
The row for “Improvement Percentage” (IP) is the 
percentage factor of {100-(Proposed Design/Existing 
Design)*100} %. For example, for a D flip-flop design, our 
realization has 1 gate while Existing Design [10] has 11 
gates. Thus, the ratio is {100-(1/11)*100} % = 91%. The 
cost of constant input, quantum cost and hardware 
complexity is not summarized by all the researchers of their 
reversible sequential elements. We count these numbers 
based on their designs and show them in tables.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed a complete set of 
reversible sequential elements corresponding to available 
irreversible sequential designs. Our proposed reversible 
flip–flop and shift register realization are significantly 
improved over existing reversible realization in terms of 
gate count, garbage output, constant input, quantum cost and 
hardware complexity. We have also proposed low cost shift 
register counter design using our proposed gate. We have 
also proposed a quantum realization of our proposed gate. 
With this implementation, the power consumption of these 
reversible designs can be controlled and kept significantly 
low. Our proposed gate is parity preserving. This 
characteristic of the gate can also be used in fault tolerant 
sequential circuits designs which is still unexplored area of 
research.
