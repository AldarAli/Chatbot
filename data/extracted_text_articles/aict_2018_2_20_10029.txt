Abstract—Benefiting from the development of coherent 
detection and digital signal processing, innovative optical 
transceivers enable the dynamic adaptation of the baud rate, 
modulation level and Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding 
to the optical transmission properties. Next generation optical 
networks will require high levels of flexibility, being able to fit 
rate, bandwidth, FEC coding and optical reach requirements 
of different connections. For serving transmission on an Elastic 
Optical Network (EON), the flexible lightpath routing and the 
spectrum allocated for the connection request should be 
developed to meet the traffic requirement. In this paper, the 
Routing, Baud rate, FEC Coding, Modulation Level, Spectrum 
Allocation (RBCMLSA) problem is defined and studied. A 
heuristic algorithm, which integrates single/multiple path 
routing schemes, is proposed. The proposed algorithm is 
examined through simulations and the results show that the 
proposed algorithms can achieve good results.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the Elastic Optical Network (EON) has 
attracted intensive research because of employing Optical-
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) 
technology, which has been used to scale the demands by 
efficiently utilizing the spectrum. A key feature of EON is 
that the modulation format and the spectrum can be 
adaptively adjusted and allocated according to the distance 
and capacity requirements [1] [2]. Based on variable 
bandwidth 
devices 
(such 
as 
Bandwidth-Variable 
Transponders (BVTs) and Bandwidth-Variable Wavelength 
Cross-Connects 
(BV-WXCs)), 
EONs 
require 
more 
sophisticated 
bandwidth 
allocation 
mechanisms. 
The 
spectrum of a fiber on an EON is divided into Frequency 
Slots (FSs) and the necessary amount of consecutive FSs are 
assigned to support the connection request [1] [2]. The 
number of required FSs is determined by the requested 
bandwidth, the modulation format, the (fixed) slice width 
and the Guard Band (GB) introduced to separate two 
spectrum adjacent connections, among others. The controller 
should find Routing, Modulation Level and Spectrum 
Assignment (RMLSA) for the connection request.  
In EONs, the transmitting rate of the transmitter ranges 
from 2.5 Gb/s to 400 Gb/s. Benefiting from the development 
of coherent detection and digital signal processing, 
innovative optical transceivers enables the dynamic 
adaptation of the baud rate, modulation level and Forward 
Error Correction (FEC) coding to the optical transmission 
properties.  
Sambo et al. [3] proposed a programmable controller on 
the Software Definition Network (SDN)-EONs. Several 
parameters (such as channel types, number of carries, 
transmitting rate, modulation format, central frequency, 
channel wide, FEC types, and number of FSs) can be 
dynamically determined to meet the connection request on 
the network. Cugini et al. [4] proposed the idea of the plug 
and play auto-configuring transmitters of the optical network. 
In the proposed environment, the control plane should be 
capable of performing effective routing and spectrum 
assignment as well as proper selection of the transmission 
parameters (e.g., baud rate, modulation format, coding type) 
depending on the required Transmission Reach (TR) or 
maximum transmission distance. 
A. Multipath Routing 
For online provisioning, it is difficult to serve certain 
large bandwidth (BW) requests with single-path routing due 
to the BW or TR limitation. Thus, it results in high request 
blocking probability [17] [18]. Lu et al. [18] suggested that a 
connection's traffic could be split over multiple paths without 
causing significant bandwidth waste. They proposed a 
dynamic 
multi-path 
algorithm, 
which 
considers 
the 
differential delay constraint. Zhu et al. [17] proposed two 
dynamic algorithms that incorporate a Hybrid Single-/Multi-
path Routing (HSMR) scheme on the RMLSA model 
(denoted as RMLSA-HSMR). They considered dynamic 
RMLSA problem with various path selection policies for 
multipath provisioning in EONs [17]. The simulating results 
showed that the proposed hybrid single-/multi-path routing 
scheme could effectively reduce the blocking probability, by 
comparing to the single-path routing scheme. 
B. Studied Problem 
In the future, the next generation optical networks will 
require high levels of flexibility. Based on the new provided 
capabilities of the transponders, the controller will be able to 
adjust baud rate, bandwidth, FEC coding, modulation format 
and optical reach requirements of different connections. In 
this paper, the dynamic routing problem on EONs with 
flexible transceivers is studied. In the given EONs, the 
parameters of transceivers (including baud rate, modulation 
format, and FEC type) can be determined and selected by the

network controllers. For a given EON and a sequence of 
connection requests, the goal is to find lightpaths and 
assigned suitable channels to lightpaths and meet the traffic 
and TR requirement such that the performance measure can 
be optimized. Since for each request, the baud rate, 
modulation format, and FEC type should be determined and 
find suitable spectrum, this problem is denoted as the 
Routing, Baud rate, Code, Modulation Level, and 
Spectrum Allocation (RBCMLSA) problem. Unlike 
previous works in RCMLSA and RMLSA, the proposed 
algorithm selects not only the route and the spectrum but also 
the baud rate, FEC type, and modulation format best suited 
to establish an optical connection.  
In the paper, the hybrid single-/multi-path routing 
scheme is considered. The blocking performance of the 
proposed algorithm is evaluated in comparison to the 
RCMLSA and RMLSA approaches. Based on the survey, 
there is no article that considered the RBCMLSA problem 
with flexible transceivers for multipath routing. In this paper, 
a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the RBCMLSA 
problem with dynamic traffic. The proposed algorithm is 
examined through simulations and the results show that the 
proposed algorithm can achieve good results. 
The remainder of this paper is as follows: Section 2 
describes the related works; Section 3 defines the new 
RBCMLSA problem; Section 4 presents the details of the 
proposed algorithm; Section 5 gives performance evaluation 
by means of simulation; Section 6 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORKS 
In this section, several studies related to the 
RBCMLSA problem will be stated.  
A. FEC 
In an optical network, the Optical Signal to Noise Ratio 
(OSNR) of a high data rate optical signal would degrade 
significantly over long transmission distances. This 
degradation can be compensated by using the FEC coding 
techniques [5]. FEC technologies were first proposed for 
fiber-optic communications, before signal modulation and 
transmission. In FEC coding, redundant overhead (OH) bits 
are added to the information bits [6]. FEC techniques with 
different error correcting capabilities were studied to 
evaluate both the performance of different FEC types and 
corresponding tradeoffs between their Net Coding Gains 
(NCGs) and their coding overheads. The future trends 
expected for FECs to combat even higher transmission 
impairments were presented in [7]. The evolution of FEC 
technologies can be classified into three generations [7] [8]. 
The first generation used block codes. A typical example is 
Reed-Solomon (RS)[255, 239]. The second generation used 
concatenated codes. An example is RS[255, 239]+Bose-
Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH)[1023, 963]. The third 
generation used the more powerful soft decision decoding 
technique. The Block Turbo Code (BTC) and Low Density 
Parity Check (LDPC) code are two representatives of this 
generation. The OH, NCG, data rate and OSNR values are 
summarized in Table 1 [6]. Guo et al. [6] considered Shared 
Backup Path Protection (SBPP)-based EONs with the 
adaptive FEC allocation strategy. They developed an Integer 
Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model as well as a 
Spectrum Window Planes (SWPs)-based heuristic algorithm. 
The results showed that the adaptive FEC allocation strategy 
is very effective in significantly increasing the network 
capacity of an EON [6].

B. RCSA vs. RCMLSA 
Sambo et al. [9] [10] studied the Routing, Code, and 
Spectrum Assignment (RCSA) problem. For a given 
connection request and fixed modulation format, a set of 
candidate paths is constructed and the coding scheme with 
minimal extra information is selected, and then the required 
spectrum is allocated. Sambo et al. [9] [10] considered the 
Time Frequency Packing (TFP) [11] as the coding scheme.  
Garrido et al. [12] considered the Routing, Code, 
Modulation Level, and Spectrum Allocation (RCMLSA) 
problem. In RCMLSA, not only the route and spectrum but 
also the pair FEC code-modulation format best suited are 
selected to establish an optical connection in EONs. In [12], 
the provided data rates (10, 40, 100, 400, 1000 Gb/s), 
modulation formats (Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)/ 
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)) /8 Quadrature 
Amplitude Modulation (QAM)/16QAM/32QAM/64QAM) 
and different FEC codes (non-FEC/type 1 FEC/type 2 
FEC/type 3 FEC) are considered. They proposed an 
algorithm to determine the route/modulation level/FEC type 
to minimize the number of required FSs for the connection 
request. Simulating results showed that the blocking 
probability of the RCMLSA model is lower than that of the 
RMLSA and RCSA models. However, in [12], the baud rate 
of the transceiver was fixed and cannot be selected by the 
network controller. In this paper, we use the RCMLSA 
problem as a base and extend it by considering the baud rate 
selection. The TR of a transmitting parameter may change if 
the baud rate change, thus this results in a new and more 
practical routing problem. 
Alvarado et al. [13] found that joint optimization of the 
constellation and FEC OHs can yield large gains in terms of 
overall network throughput. They also studied the 
15

performance of the EON whose transmitters with two baud 
rates and a single constellation. The result in [13] suggested 
that one low baud rate could be used for the worst 
performing connection, while the other rate is used to 
increase the overall network throughput. Moreover, the 
results are quite close to the optimal baud rate of the 
corresponding one-rate scheme [14]. 
C. Transmission Reach 
The TR or maximum distance of a single-core optical-
amplified fiber is determined by several factors. The major 
impairments are Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) 
noise and fiber nonlinearities [15]. The TR of a fiber-optic 
link can be estimated by the following formula [15]:  
 
TR =PS × Lspan / (SNRmin × h × fs × AG × NF × RS), (1) 
where PS is the optical power at the transmitter. Lspan is 
the distance between amplifiers. SNRmin is the required 
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver side, which is 
related to the selected modulation format and Bit Error Ratio 
(BER) rate. For example, QPSK is 2.031dB, 8 QAM is 3.367 
dB at BER 10-3, etc. (shown in Table II)) [15]. AG is the gain 
of the amplifiers, h is Planck's constant, fs is the optical 
signal frequency, NF is the noise factor of the amplifiers, and 
RS the symbol rate including the coding overhead (optimum 
Nyquist pulses are assumed).  
Gho et al. [16] proposed a rate-adaptive transmission 
scheme using variable-rate FEC codes (concatenated RSs) 
with a fixed signal constellation and a fixed symbol rate. 
They studied the problem that how achievable bitrates vary 
with distance in a long-haul fiber system. They found that, 
with zero margins, an information bitrate could be realized 
up to 2000 km, with the achievable rate decreasing by 
approximately 40% for every additional 1000 km. 
III. 
PROBLEM DEFINITION 
In the following, the assumptions, constraints, notations 
and the definitions of the studied problem are given. 
A. Assumption 
  For each link, there is a fiber connecting the end-nodes 
and signal can be transmitted bidirectional. 
  All nodes in the network are equipped with BV-WXC 
and BVT. 
  For simplicity, the numbers of FSs provided by links are 
all equal. 
  A GB should be allocated between two lightpaths. 
  The bandwidth requirement between nodes can be 
transmitted by using multiple lightpaths with the same or 
different routes and numbers of FSs [18]. 
B. Constraints 
Three constraints are considered in this paper, they are 
spectrum continuity constraint, subcarrier consecutiveness 
constraint, and non-overlapping spectrum constraint. Due to 
space limitation, the definition of these constraints can be 
found in [1]. To avoid a request from being split over too 
many lightpaths and causing too many guard bands, a BW 
allocation granularity (denoted as g FSs) is included [17]. 
Specifically, when the request is provisioned over more than 
one routing path, the minimum number of the FSs, which 
can be allocated on each path, is g [17]. 
C. Notations 
 G= (V, E, l): The physical topology of the network, 
where V= {v1, v2, ..., vn} is the set of nodes (|V| = n), E= 
{e1, e2, ..., em} is the set of links (|E| = m), and l(e) is the 
distance (kilometers) of the link e in E. 
 r=(s, d, BWsd): The connection request, where s in V and 
d in V is the source and destination node of the request, 
respectively. BWsd is the required bandwidth (Gb/s) of the 
lightpaths between nodes s and d. 
 B: the set of baud rates. 
 M: the set of modulation formats {PM-QPSK, PM-
8QAM, PM-16QAM, PM-32QAM, PM-64QAM} in the 
network. 
 F: the set of FEC types, and F={no-FEC, Type 1 with 
RS[255, 235], type 2 with RS[255, 239]-BCH[1023, 963], 
type 3 with LDPC[416, 3431, 0.825], type 4 rate-
adaptive code}. 
 Rsd = {R1sd, R2sd, ..., Rksd}: The set of k routing paths 
between s and d. This set can be computed by performing 
the Eppstein algorithm [19] in O(|E|+k|V|+|V|log|V|). 
 OH[b, f, m]: A 3-dimensional matrix, where the element 
OH[b, f, m] represents the required overhead when the 
baud rate b∈B, the modulation format m∈M and the FEC 
scheme f ∈F are used.  
 D[b, f, m]: A 3-dimensional matrix, where the element 
D[b, f, m] represents the TR when b∈B, m∈M and f∈F. 
 FM(Risd, BWsd): A priority queue, which contains all the 
triples (b, f, m) whose transmission reach is equal to or 
higher than the length of routing path. That is, FM(Risd, 
BWsd)={(b, f, m)| dist(Risd) ≤ D[b, f, m]} for b∈B, m∈M 
and f∈F and dist(Risd) is the distance of the path Risd. 
 Pnew: The set of routing paths, Pnew ={(pisd (bi, fi, mi, Ni), i 
=1, 2, ..., z}}, where bi∈B, fi ∈F, mi∈M and Ni is the 
number of allocated FSs of the ith lightpath. 
 
The values of OH[b, f, m] can be obtained from Table I, 
which are assumed independent with the b and m. Moreover, 
for the type 4 rate-adaptive FEC coding, the overhead is set 
to 66.66% for extending the TR to 1000 km from non-FEC 
coding [16]. The values of OH[b, f, m] can be calculated by 
using the formula (1) for the non-FEC type and estimated by 
using linear interpolation based on the observation in [16] 
and shown in Table IV. Each flexible transceiver was 
assumed capable of operating with five modulation formats 
and five FEC coding levels and several possible baud rates 
(shown in Table IV). For some baud rates, several 
modulation formats and some data rates are not supported. 
For example, consider Table IV, for baud rates 28, 30, 32, 
only the PM-QPSK and PM-16QAM and data rates (10, 40, 
100) are supported. 
After selecting the routing path Risd ∈ Rsd the number of 
required FSs for different bandwidth (10, 40, 100, 400, 1000) 
of the request can be determined by using b, f, m. If the 
16

request is supported by a single lightpath, the minimal 
number of required FSs of the lightpath (denoted as Nsd) can 
be computed by 
(2) 
where Cf is the bandwidth (Gb/s) provided by each FS. If 
the connection request is supported by z (>1) multiple 
lightpaths and the set of routing paths are path1, path2, ..., 
pathz, then the minimal number of required FSs for the 
demand BWsd by using the multipath routing can be 
computed by the formula: 
(3) 
where bi, fi and mi are the selected parameters of the pathi, 
and subjects to constraints Σzi=1BWisd ≥ BWsd and BWisd × 
(1+OH[bi, fi, mi])/(Cf×mi) ≥ g, ∀i = 1, 2, ..., z.  
 
IV. 
PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
In this section, the details of the proposed RBCMLSA-
HSMR algorithm are described. For a new connection 
request r =(s, d, BWsd), the set Pnew = {pisd| i =1, 2, ..., z} of 
lightpaths should be established to route the request. 
A. RBCMLSA-HSMR 
For the connection request r =(s, d, BWsd), the k-shortest 
paths algorithm is performed on the network G(V, E, l) to 
find a set of candidate paths R ={Risd, i=1, 2, ..., k}. Paths in 
P are sorted in ascending order according to the distances of 
the paths dist(Risd) on the network G(V, E, l). The shortest 
path is selected first because more efficient modulation 
format and better FEC type can be selected such that the 
number of required FSs can be reduced. For the selected path 
Risd, 1≤i≤ z the following steps are performed. 
 
  The priority queue FM(Risd, BWsd), which contains all 
possible triples (b, f, m) is obtained. All triples in list 
FM(Risd, BWsd) are sorted increasingly according to the 
number of required FSs (if there is a tie, the order is 
determined by the smaller OH[b, f, m] and larger m). 
  If the list FM(Risd, BWsd) is empty, the next candidate 
path (i=i+1) in P is selected and analyzed.  
  If the list FM(Risd, BWsd) has at least one element, the 
pair (b, f, m) corresponding to the minimum value in 
OH[b, f, m] is selected. That is, those parameters (the 
baud rate, modulation format, and FEC type) requiring 
the lowest OH for the given bit ate BWsd is selected.  
 Next, a spectrum allocation algorithm (first-fit method) 
is executed to allocate the selected number of FSs along 
the route if possible. 
  If the spectrum allocation algorithm succeeds, the 
found resources will be allocated. Otherwise, a new 
route is analyzed (i=i+1). Since it is impossible to find 
available resources on the same path for more required 
resources. 
  If no more candidate paths are available in R, i.e., all 
paths in R are examined and there is no single-path can 
be allocated to the lightpath, and then the multipath 
routing scheme will be applied if possible.  
  If multipath routing paths cannot be found, the request 
will be rejected. 
  In multipath routing scheme, the path with the best 
parameter (b, f, m) is selected and maximal available 
number of FSs is selected and allocated.  
 The remaining unsupported bandwidth is selected from 
the same path first (with the same parameter or 
different parameters) if possible. 
 Otherwise, other paths in R are examined repeatedly 
until the required bandwidth is satisfied. 
The request is first routed by a single path, if possible. 
After checking all possible paths for single-path routing and 
the request cannot be routed by a single path, then the multi-
path routing scheme is applied. It is worth noting that the 
same candidate path can be selected as the routing path more 
than once but with different FS index. The bandwidth BWisd 
allocated to the selected path pisd ∈ Pnew is determined based 
on the network status and should satisfy the constraint 
.  
When the connection request is routed by multiple paths, 
more FSs will be used for the guard band. In the context of 
this study, we assume that GB = 1 and this guard band is 
inserted as the highest indexed slot in the spectrum 
assignment of each connection. The request r = (s, d, BWsd) 
is blocked, if a feasible set of routing paths Pnew = {pis,d (bi, fi, 
mi, Ni), i= 1, 2, ..., z} cannot be found. The details of the 
RBCMLSA-HSMR algorithm are shown in Algorithm 1.  
V. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
The proposed algorithms were coded by using C++ 
programming language. All simulations were run on a 
notebook computer with Intel Core i7-4710 HQ CPU 2.5 
GHz, 16.0 GB RAM and with Windows 10 pro 64-bit 
operating system. The COST239 network (showed in Figure 
2), which is a famous and widely used network topology, 
was used for simulations. The distance between nodes in 
COST239 can fit the parameters provided in Table IV. Other 
well-known network topologies will be examined in the 
future study. In Figure 2, the number nears the link is the 
length (km.) of the fiber.  
In the simulation, the static traffic is simulated for 
different sets with different numbers (50, 100, 150, and 200) 
of requests. The number of candidate paths for a request is k 
= 20. The connection request is randomly generated 
uniformly for different pairs of nodes, the number of 
required bandwidth (Gb/s) is within [10, 2000]. For each 
fiber of the network, 320 FSs are provided and Cf = 12.5 
Gb/s. Two algorithms for different models are implemented 
for comparison; they are RCMLSA model [12] and RMLSA 
model [17].

Figure 1. RBCMLSA-HSMR 
 
For each algorithm, both the single-path routing and the 
hybrid simple-/multi-path routing schemes are implemented. 
The parameters for RMLSA model are shown in Table III, 
which are the same as the best parameters for RBCMLSA 
(shown in Table IV), but without FEC overhead. The 
maximum distance or TR limits by 1,292 km. The 
parameters for RCMLSA model are selected from the central 
part of Table IV, but the highest bandwidth limitation is 
released (i.e. it can support up to 1000 Gb/s). 
Several performance criteria are considered in this paper, 
they are:  
 
Blocking Ratio (BR), which is defined as the ratio 
of the number of blocked requests versus the 
number of total requests.  
 
Multipath Ratio (MR), which is the ratio of the 
number of requests routed by multiple paths to that 
of the number of successful requests. 
 
The average number of allocated FSs per lightpath,  
 
the average hops per lightpath,  
 
the average number of lightpaths per request, and 
 
computation time.  
 
In the COST239 network, the simulation results are 
shown in Figure 3. Figure 3(a) shows the average number of 
paths per request of the RCMLSA method is greater than 
that of the other methods. The average number of paths per 
request increases as the number of requests increases. Figure 
3(b) shows the average number of FSs per lightpath of the 
RCMLSA single path routing method is greater than that of 
the other methods. The average number of FSs per lightpath 
decreases as the number of requests increases. The average 
number of FSs per lightpath for single-path routing scheme 
is higher than that of the multipath routing scheme. Figure 
3(c) shows the average number of hops per lightpath of the 
RMCMLSA multipath routing method is greater than that of 
the other methods. 
The average number of hops per lightpath decreases as 
the number of requests increases from 50 to 150. The 
average number of hops per lightpath for multipath routing 
scheme is higher than that of the single-path routing scheme. 
Figure 3(d) shows that the BR of the RBCMLSA multipath 
routing is lower than that of the other methods. For single-
path routing, the BR of the RBCMLSA method is lower than 
that of the other methods. The result also shows that 
multipath routing scheme can reduce the BR about 40%. The 
BR increases as the number of requests increases. Figure 3(e) 
shows that the MR of the RCMLSA multipath routing is 
higher than that of the other methods. The MR increases as 
the number of requests increases. Figure 3(f) shows that the 
CPU time in seconds of the RCMLSA multipath routing is 
higher than that of the other methods. The RBCMLSA 
multipath is the second highest.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, the Routing, Baud rate, FEC Coding, 
Modulation Level, and Spectrum Allocation (RBCMLSA) 
problem has been defined and studied. For serving 
transmission on an EON, the goal is to design a routing and 
spectrum assignment algorithm to establish lightpaths. In the 
studied problem, the hybrid single/multipath routing scheme 
has developed to increase the spectrum efficiency. A 
heuristic algorithm denoted as RBCMLSA-HSMR, which 
integrates single/multiple paths routing scheme has been 
proposed. The proposed algorithm has been examined 
through simulations on the COST239 network and the results 
show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the blocking 
probability about 40%.  
The results show that using flexible transmitters and 
adaptive transmitting parameters, the proposed algorithm can 
get lower blocking probability both in single-path and 
multiple-path routing schemes. Thus, the performance for 
routing in the RBCMLSA model is better than that of 
RMLSA and RCMLSA models. This is because of that 
controller can find a better routing path together with better 
parameters in RBCMLSA model, such that the required 
number of FSs can be reduced and the spectrum of the 
network can be used more efficiently. Simulation results also 
show that multipath-routing scheme does reduce the 
blocking probability whatever in RMLSA, RCMLSA, or 
RBCMLSA models.  
In the future, the performance of the proposed algorithm 
on different networks will be simulated, and more feasible 
transmitting parameters of the flexible transceivers will be 
collected and examined. Moreover, the more problems in the 
RBCMLSA model that are important will be studied. For 
example, the survival routing problem, de-fragmentation 
problem on the single-fiber network or the multi-fiber 
network.
