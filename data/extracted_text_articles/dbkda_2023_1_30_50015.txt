Abstract—In this paper, the dominant factor for sustainable 
growth in football teams is described. Using the data of Japan-
League teams, we conducted machine learning based regression 
and its interpretation by Shapley values revealed the Academy 
development was significant. In the financially large-scaled 
strongest teams, the Academy development is important to 
sustain the high scores/ranking. In small or medium sized teams, 
Academy development is another approach for growth to the 
upper league under limited budget. To measure the Academy 
development level, Matsuhashi’s Measure based on Shapley 
values is proposed and it is proven that Matsuhashi’s Measure 
has the highest correlation with the top strongest teams’ 
winning points.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This study is a regression-based corporate evaluation 
analysis, and the subject of the analysis is football teams in the 
Japan-League (hereafter J-League), which will soon celebrate 
its 30th anniversary since 1993. The main evaluation indicator 
for football clubs is how effectively they perform under a 
limited budget. This is a common goal to every professional 
sports organization.  
Investing a large amount of money for a high performance 
is a straightforward and instant approach. The first objective 
of this paper, however, is to explore another approach by 
which a small/medium sized team can effectively grow with a 
limited budget. The first author, Matsuhashi, has been 
interested in data analysis of the J.-League for many years. He 
has found some cases in which utilizing young players from 
the academy were important to the league performance for the 
teams. These clubs had small budgets in early years. However, 
owing to the results of such young players, the club increased 
its ranking, promoted to J1 League, and gradually expanded 
its scale. Then, in order to measure the Academy development 
level, Matsuhashi’s Measure was defined in our previous 
work [1].  
The second objective of the paper is to explore 
sustainability of the already large-scaled teams. In general, it 
is difficult to maintain high-performance in a company. In J-
League, it is difficult for the strongest teams to keep the top 
positions. The paper showed that one of the driving forces is 
Academy development. In the paper, we will prove that 
Matsuhashi’s Measure is useful to measure the large-scaled 
football team’s sustainability.  
We use machine learning regression analysis and Shapley 
values for interpretation of the result. The next section 
describes the data we used. Section 3 describes the analysis 
method 
using 
Shapley 
values. 
Section 
4 
explains 
Matsuhashi’s Measure (MM) and shows the high correlation 
between the MM values and sustained high performance large 
teams. In Section 5, discussion concerning Matsuhashi’s 
Measure is conducted. Finally, we conclude this paper.

DATA AND METHOD 
In this section, we explain the data used and the regression 
analysis method. 
The cost of strengthening a professional soccer team is 
enormous in every country. The dominant part of the cost is 
the personnel cost for star players, but there is a disparity in 
financial scale of teams. Figure 1 shows a scatterplot between 
10-year average operating revenues and total assets of the 
clubs from J-League. J1 is the top category, followed by J2 
and J3. As shown in Figure 1, there is the tendency that the 
larger financial sized team, the higher ranking it has.  
On the other hand, however, some medium-sized teams 
belong to J1. We found that they are committed to Academy 
development. Therefore, the following hypotheses were 
formulated for the growth pattern of small and medium-sized 
clubs.

Hypothesis: Smaller clubs with smaller budgets can 
take an approach to achieve higher performance by 
training young players in Academies. 
We will conduct analysis to find such clubs. The analysis 
method is regression. The target variable is the annual ranking 
in the league converted into a score of 100 points, with 100 
being the highest. As for the choice of explanatory variables, 
we examined the correlation coefficients among the 
managerial variables and found that many of them had 
multicollinearity, so we finally selected the following two 
explanatory variables. 
 
Explanatory variables 
(1) Salary costs: Personnel costs for the year. 
(2) Academy operating costs: Total costs for the seven 
years prior to the target year (2021). 
 
The impact of (1) salary costs’ increase is instant but short. 
In contrast, (2) academy operation costs take long time until 
the effects appear. To see the effect, we use 7-year total cost 
of Academy operations. For example, when analyzing the 
2021 season, the target value is the ranking scores in 2021and 
the salary cost data in 2021 are used. Concerning Academy 
operating costs, data from 2014 to 2020 are used. Data were 
taken from the site of J-League official [2]. This is about the 
financial data written in English, which includes all clubs 
belonging to J-League.  
The regression analysis method was the XGBoost 
algorithm by scikit-learn package [3] [4]. Its GitHub site [5] 
has more information on the algorithm. Explanatory 
variables are, in advance, standardized for each variable 
shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. Resultant regression model with standardized salary 
and academy values and the ranking score as the target. 
 
In Figure 2, the observation data represented by red points 
are plotted in a three-dimensional regression model f(X). The 
warm colours such as brown correspond to higher target 
values.  
In general, the more the salary and Academy operating 
costs, the higher the rank score. However, there are some 
exceptional medium-sized teams which have high rank scores 
even though their financial resources are limited. The teams 
will be later described in Section 4. 
III. 
SHAPLEY VALUE 
In this section, Shapley and SHAP values that we used are 
explained. 
Shapley values are solutions in a game theory by multiple 
players [6-8] [9]. If n players work together, the profit (for 
example, 900 EURO) is divided to them. Then how they 
should divide the profit? How much is the individual player’s 
contribution? Shapley found the unique solution of this 
question.   
The main concept of Shapley values is characteristic 
function 𝜈(𝑋): 
ν ∶ 2n → 𝑅  
where n is the number of players and R means the profit by 
the subset of players. For example, there are three players A, 
B, and C. If A and B work together, the profit is 600 EURO. 
If C works together with A and B, then the profit becomes 900 
EURO. The characteristic function defines the profit 
corresponding to any subset of players.  
If n is 3, then the number of subsets is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8. In a 
real world (not in a theoretical world), it is too difficult to 
define the characteristic function. However, if such a 
characteristic function is given or can be found, each player’s 
profit can be calculated using the following formula: 
 
 
 
 
where 𝜙𝑖 is the Shapley value for player i, F is a set of players, 
and S is a subset of F which does not include i-th player, 𝑆 ⊆
𝐹 ∖ {𝑖}.  
     |𝐹|!  is the permutations of the number of F. The term 
[𝜈(𝑥𝑆∪{𝑖}) − 𝜈(𝑥𝑆)] is player i’s marginal contribution to the 
profit by S; the function 𝜈 is evaluated with the input of the 
player set (𝑥𝑆∪{𝑖})  and then the function 𝜈 is evaluated with 
the input of the player set (𝑥𝑆). The difference [𝜈(𝑥𝑆∪{𝑖}) −
𝜈(𝑥𝑆)] is the key part of the Shapley formula.  
The term |𝑆|! (|𝐹| − |𝑆| − 1)! /|𝐹|!   expresses the 
appearance possibility of 𝑥𝑆∪{𝑖} . First S exists and then 
player i comes, and finally the left members of which 
number is (|𝐹| − |𝑆| − 1) attend. Equality of appearance 
possibility is supposed here. 
Finally, the sum of weighted differences is calculated 
that becomes the player i’s profit. The easy explanation of 
the formula was described by Roth in [8].   
Lundberg et al. modified the original Shapley value, so 
that we can use Shapley values in the machine learning 
regression analysis [10] [11] [12]. The customized Shapley 
value is called SHAP values. The differences are as follows: 
(1) SHAP is defined for each explanatory variable i, 
instead of player i. 
(2) Each data has its own characteristic function. 
(3) The characteristic function is calculated using the 
regression prediction model  𝑓(𝑋) 
 
𝜙𝑖 =
∑
|𝑆|! (|𝐹| − |𝑆| − 1)!
|𝐹|!
[𝜈(𝑥𝑆∪{𝑖}) − 𝜈(𝑥𝑆)]
𝑆⊆𝐹∖{𝑖}

In this case of this paper, each football team has its 
characteristic function which is calculated using the 
regression prediction model  𝑓(𝑋). The regression model is 
visually shown in Figure 2.  The vertical axis means the 
predicted target values. 
Using the resultant regression model 𝑓(𝑋), an individual 
team’s characteristic function 𝜈𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑚(𝑋)  is calculated. 
Function 𝝂𝒕𝒆𝒂𝒎(𝑿) predicts the team’s target value for 
any subset of explanatory variables. The characteristic 
function for each team reflects the team’s behavioral 
characteristics.  
If there is a missing value among the predictors, the value 
of f(X) cannot be calculated. Lundberg’s idea is to input the 
average value of the predictor variable for the missing 
parameter [10]. By this idea, they could solve the problem that 
the characteristic function could not be defined in a real world.  
In Operational Management field, the concept of an industry 
average value is very important. In industry analysis, we 
firstly investigate whether a particular company's value is 
above or below the industry average. We think that this 
solution is reasonable from the industry analysis viewpoint as 
well. 
In this paper, we express each predictor’s SHAP value as 
“predictor_SHAP” such as Academy_SHAP. 
 
 
Figure 3. Target deviation values are divided to 2 SHAP 
values. 
 
The resultant two SHAP values per team are visually 
illustrated in Figure 3. The x axis shows the 34 football teams. 
The y axis shows the deviation of target value which is its 
target value minus the average. The total SHAP values per 
team approximately becomes the deviation (see Figure 3). 
Theoretically, the sum of SHAP values per data becomes 
equal to the target deviation of the data. However, if the fitting 
level of f(X) is low, the SHAP total is not equal to the deviation. 
In the lower bar chart in Figure 3, it is found that 
Salary_SHAP is much greater than Academy_SHAP. This 
means that in many teams the dominant factor of the target 
(ranking score) value is the salary expenses. However, some 
teams have significantly large Academy_SHAP. The ranking 
top team (see the right-end bar) has large Academy_SHAP, 
compared to others. In the next section, we shall evaluate the 
effect.   
In a machine-learning based regression analysis, SHAP 
values are widely used for in various fields [13, 14]. 
Concerning football players, there are many researches using 
Shapley/SHAP values.  
Sizov et al. use Shapley values to determine the salary 
prices or values of football players [15]. Hiller uses Shapley 
values to determine the performance/importance of players in 
each team of the Bundesliga in the season 2012/2013 [16]. 
Buzzacchi1 et al. use Shapley values to evaluate ranking of 
football managers in the Italian Serie A [17]. Marc Garnica-
Caparrós uses SHAP values to understand gender differences 
in professional European football [18]. For example, it says 
that a high number of ground duels increases the probability 
of the model classifying a female player. 
Although there are many researches by SHAP-based 
approach in the football field, as above mentioned, the target 
is the players’ performance or managers’ skills. As far as we 
know, there are no football team’s management strategy 
evaluation by the SHAP approach. Our research is the first 
football teams’ managerial structure evaluation by SHAP 
values. 
In other fields except football, managerial researches by 
using SHAP values exist, as industry analysis [19][20] [21]-
[23] [24]. 
 
IV. 
ACADEMY DEVELOPMENT LEBEL MEASUREMENT 
In this section, we propose a measurement of academy 
training achievement level using the SHAP values described 
in the previous section. 
First, we consider meanings of the Academy_SHAP value. 
Even if the Academy's operating expenses are large, if the 
Academy does not generate results, the ranking score does not 
increase and the Academy_SHAP value does not increase. In 
addition, even if players from the academy play more games, 
they do not always play important roles to obtain points of 
victory. Just Academy_SHAP is not sufficient to express the 
Academy development level, because there may be other 
hidden factors that contribute to the improvement in the 
ranking. In general, it is difficult to find causal relationships 
in policy and strategy evaluation [25]. 
To solve the problem, Matsuhashi defined the 
measurement for Academy development levels, based on the 
SHAP values. A new concept titled "percentage of 
Academy graduates’ participant ratio" is introduced. This 
is the ratio of the number of appearances by players from the 
Academy to the number of league games available in a season 
(For example, for J1 in 2019, 34 games x 14 players). The 
calculation of the percentage of Academy graduates’ 
participant ratio is defined as A/B where

➢ 
A: Total number of games from 2019 to 2021 played 
by Academy graduate players since 2011. 
➢ 
B: The number of available slots for the three-year 
period from 2019 to 2021.  
 
Matsuhashi's Measure = (Percentage of Academy 
graduates’ participant ratio) x (Academy_SHAP value). 
 
Next, we evaluate the performance of the measure. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Relation between Matsuhashi’s Measure and the 
average winning points with the correlation coefficient 0.94. 
 
 
In Figure 4, the operating revenues top 6 teams in J-
League are selected and the data are plotted. The x-axis shows 
Matsuhashi’s Measure and the y-axis shows the average 
winning points from 2019 to 2021. These highest operating 
revenue teams are likely to be strongest ones as shown in 
Figure 1. The correlation coefficient of the relationship is 0.94 
(see Figure 4). This high correlation value indicates that 
the Matsuhashi’s measure is highly correlated with the 
ranking score in the top group.  
The reason why the 3-year average winning points are 
used is that we would like to investigate the performance in 
the sustained period. From the relationship, we can say that 
one of elements for maintaining strong teams is an 
excellent 
academy 
development 
base, 
and 
that 
Matsuhashi’s Measure could measure the Academy 
development level with high accuracy.  
Reversely, what is the feature of the highest Matsuhashi’s 
Measure team? In Table 1, the top 11 teams with the highest 
Matsuhashi’s Measure values for three years through 2021 are 
listed. The names in yellow indicates a small or medium sized 
teams.  In the scale-based clustering in Figure 1, these 11 
teams are belonging to green or red clusters. 
In the previous work, Matsuhashi described the followings 
[1]:  Although the ordinary strategy is to improve the ranking 
by increasing the financial investment, there were some 
medium-sized clubs that achieve high performance by 
investing in the Academy operation expenses. The 
Matsuhashi's Measure was effective in identifying these 
growing medium-sized clubs. 
TABLE 1. TEAMS WITH HIGHEST MATSUHASHI’S 
MEASURE VALUES. 
 
 
Using the resultant regression model, the highest 
Matsuhashi’s Measure 11 teams are marked in the regression 
model (see Figure 5 and 6). The blue arrow marks depict the 
J1_1 to J1_3 which are the large-scaled teams in J1. The 
number of medium-sized teams in Table 1 is 8. These clubs  
have potential to be in a transition state to the large-scaled 
teams. Among them, the higher 5 teams are marked in the 
large circle, and the other lower 3 teams are marked in the 
small circle in Figure 5. The teams in the large circle can be 
identified growing medium-sized teams which produce high 
ranking scores.

The closer look of the transition-state teams is shown in 
Figure 6. The 5 teams in the large circle have higher ranking 
score (target) values, compared with the teams in the small 
circle. Especially the team “S” with the highest Matsuhashi’s 
Measure has the highest target value. The medium-sized 
teams could be divided to the upper 5 teams and the lower 3 
teams by target values as well as by the Matsihashi's Measure.

teams on the regression model.  
 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
In this section, the reliability of Matsuhashi’s Measure 
(hereafter MM) will be discussed. 
From the previous section result, it was found that the 
highest MM teams include  
(1) the strongest three teams in 2021 which are large-
scaled (J1_1 to J1_3), and 
(2) effectively growing teams in 2021 which are medium-
scaled. 
When we compare MM values of J1_1 through J1_3, the 
strongest J1_1 team’s MM is larger by approximately 17 times 
(divide 1.54 by 0.091). One of driving forces of J1_1’s 
strength may be the Academy development level. Among the 
large-scaled teams, the high correlation 0.94 is found between 
MM values and the average winning points (see Figure 4). 
Among the large-scaled teams, Academy development level 
is important for the sustainability of the high performance and 
the level may be measured by MM.  
     Among medium-sized teams, there is high correlation 
between MM values and the target ranking scores (see Table 
1 and Figure 6). For a medium-sized team, driving forces for 
growing is the Academy development level and the level may 
be measured by Matsuhashi’s Measure, 
This study focuses on the relationship between academy 
development and annual ranking. The relationship represented 
by Matsuhashi's Measure may just a correlation and may not 
be a causal relationship. More analyses are necessary to prove 
the causal relationship [25]. This is our future research theme. 
At this stage, we can say that academy development is one of 
dominant factors to maintain its high performance for large-
scaled teams and one of the effective approaches as a growth 
pattern for small and medium-sized teams.  
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we conducted a regression analysis of J-
League results and analyzed the results using Shapley values, 
or more precisely, SHAP values. The novelty of the method is 
that the SHAP value is used to evaluate the contribution of the 
individual explanatory variables to the target value, taking 
into account the structural characteristics of individual 
football teams.  
Based on the SHAP of Academy costs, the Academy 
development achievement measure named Matsuhashi’s 
Measure is defined as (Percentage of Academy graduates’ 
participant ratio) x (academy_SHAP value). 
Among the large-scaled 6 teams, the correlation between 
Matsuhashi’s Measure values and average winning points was 
0.94 which is very high. For the large-scaled teams, Academic 
development may be one of their sustainability factors. Then 
Matsuhashi’s Measure may measure the stability levels.  
On the other hand, for medium-sized teams, Academy 
development gives another approach for growing. In such 
transition state teams with highest Matsuhashi’s Measure 
values, common feature can be found that they generate high 
performance effectively under the limited budgets. We can 
identify these teams’ positions visually on the regression 
model. These medium-sized teams have improved their scores 
by increasing the level of academy development achievement. 
This fact gives hope to smaller teams.  
In conclusion, Academy development gives stability of 
high ranking to large and strongest teams and for the medium-
sized teams, sustainable growth. In the paper, to measure the 
Academy development level, Matsuhashi’s Measure can be 
used with high accuracy.   
Lastly, we shall describe the novelty of this analysis 
method.  As company performance analysts, our interests 
exist on finding another approach to growth or success other 
than large investment. Observing the regression model, we 
may identify medium-sized but high-performance companies. 
Investigating the managerial states of these companies in the 
transition state, we would be able to find another approach 
strategy specific to the industry field. In the paper, the target 
industry field was the football team management. Then the 
recommended strategy was Academy training which was 
effective for sustained growth.  
We shall continue to clarify the cause and result relation 
for high performance in football team strategies.
