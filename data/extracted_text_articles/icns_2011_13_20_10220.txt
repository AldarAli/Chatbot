Abstract— During an off-peak hour of a day, a Mobile 
Terminal (MT) can stay in idle mode for long time as there is 
no incoming or outgoing packet. An idle MT can move from 
one location to another and the wireless access network keeps 
tracking the idle MT. Idle MTs need to assist the wireless 
access network for location update; so that, on call arrival the 
network can route the call successfully. Mean while, Voice over 
IP (VoIP) got wide acceptance. To provide VoIP service in 
mobile environment or any IP packet based service, Mobile IP 
is very important protocol undeniably. However, Proxy Mobile 
IP was developed by IETF without considering the idle mode 
condition of MTs. Consequently, an idle MT needs to conduct 
Mobile IP binding (Layer 3 location update) whenever it moves 
to new area of a Foreign Agent although it does not have any 
incoming or outgoing packets during idle period. This 
phenomenon unnecessarily increases location update signaling 
cost. Here in this paper, based on optical wireless integrated 
access network we propose a mechanism that allows only 
Layer 2 location update when an MT is in idle mode and the 
Layer 3 location update is conducted after call arrives for an 
idle MT. Our numerical results show that proposed 
mechanism out performs than the existing solutions.

 INTRODUCTION 
Energy consumed by network equipments is huge [4]. In 
the future, it can be anticipated that network will have more 
expansion, hence number of network node/equipment 
supposed to have an astronomical growth. To reduce amount 
for carbon footprint, energy saving in network has become 
an important research issue. Therefore, some researchers 
have 
considered 
idle 
mode 
condition 
in 
network 
devices/nodes. Authors in [5, 6] consider about idle mode in 
Optical Network Units (ONU). Adopting there mechanisms 
it is possible to reduce energy consumption in ONUs 
significantly. Similarly, it is also possible to reduce energy 
consumption 
by 
minimizing 
unnecessary 
signaling 
messages. It is because to produce signaling message one 
node needs to spend its computational power. Furthermore, 
by eliminating such unnecessary signaling message it is also 
possible to improve bandwidth utilization.  
During idle period an MT needs to listen the paging 
signals periodically and updates its location [1]. All wireless 
access technologies (e.g., IEEE802.16e) require location 
update for idle MTs. So that, on call arrival they can be 
paged at the right location. Mean while Voice over IP (VoIP) 
got wide acceptance. To provide VoIP service in mobile 
environment, Mobile IP (MIP) is very important protocol 
undeniably. However, even the latest Proxy Mobile IP 
(PMIP) developed by IETF does not consider the idle mode 
situation MTs [2]. As a result, an idle MT needs to conduct 
PMIP binding (Layer 3 location update) whenever it moves 
to new area despite that it does not have any active session. 
Undeniably, this phenomenon increases location update 
signaling cost. Note that the location update signaling cost 
can be defined as amount of resources spent for managing 
mobility of an MT [2].  
For convergence of optical and wireless network; for 
example, the integration of PON and WiMAX or WLAN, 
some possible cheap solutions have been proposed already 
by some researchers. Some of these solutions consider IP 
mobility in Optical Wireless Integrated Access Networks 
(OWIAN). Gangxiang Shen et al. in [3] proposed four access 
architectures for integrating Ethernet PON (EPON) and 
WiMAX. To support IP mobility, they suggest implementing 
a handover coordinator in the Optical Line Terminal (OLT). 
This handover coordinator communicates with a Wimax base 
station (BS), which is integrated with ONU, through a 
dedicated control channel. In [7], authors suggest PMIP for 
IP mobility among different ONUs. Besides, these days 
manufacturers are considering Layer 3 functionality in 
ONUs [19].  To reduce Layer 3 location update signaling 
cost, there are several existing solutions [2, 13-14]. However, 
they were not developed considering optical wireless 
integrated access network environment. To the best of our 
knowledge none of these existing works consider MTs‘ idle 
mode situation in OWAIN. Therefore, in OWIAN for an idle 
MT it is needed to conduct Layer 3 location update despite 
that there is no incoming or outgoing call for that idle MT.  
Hence, 
we 
develop 
a protocol 
considering the 
characteristics of shared network like EPON. In the OWIAN, 
we consider EPON and WiMaX integration similar to [3, 
18]. Here, our objective is to introduce a mechanism using

which Layer 3 location update becomes obsolete for an idle 
MT in OWIAN.  
In our work, the terms ‗Layer 3 location update‘ and 
‗PMIP binding‘ are used interchangeably. 
In this paper, Section II discusses related work. In 
Section III, we present proposed mechanism. Numerical 
analysis is presented in Section IV. Finally, Section V draws 
the conclusion and states future research direction.

RELATED WORK 
In this part, we first discuss some possible solutions that 
can be used in OWIAN to manage the IP mobility for the 
idle MTs and their limitations. Then we briefly explain how 
PMIP location update works. We also summarize MTs‘ idle 
mode consideration in wireless access networks. Finally, we 
present the existing works that put effort for reducing Layer 
3 location update signaling cost when an MT is in idle Mode. 
 
A. Discussion: 
Fig. 1 states how the PON network topology looks when 
Layer 3 functionality for IP mobility management is 
considered on top of the Layer 2 based PON networks.  
Note that the behavior of a particular protocol of an OSI 
Layer can have significant impact on other OSI Layers‘ 
protocols. Let‘s consider the Fig. 1 where PMIP mobility 
agents are considered in OWIAN similar to [3, 7].  Now, if 
an idle MT moves from one MA to another MA, the PMIP 
binding is needed to be conducted [8]. To conduct the PMIP 
binding, collocated MAG needs to send proxy binding 
update (PBU) message to the OLT and OLT needs to pass 
this message to the LMA (see Fig. 1). Now, if during that 
time ONU is idle mode, the PBU cannot be transmitted to 
the LMA which is collocated with the OLT. Question might 
be raised on why does not the MAG trigger the ONU to 
wakeup. Even the MAG does so, an ONU cannot transmit. 
The reason comes from the fact that PON is a shared media 
where ONUs can transmit during a dedicated uplink 
transmission slot only.  
It is also possible that an ONU can buffer that PBU 
message and then transmit to the OLT when dedicated uplink 
time slot comes. However, this solution can bring another 
problem. As the downstream of PON is broadcast and select 
mechanism, OLT needs to mark the link Layer frames with 
Logical Link Identifier (LLID), so that destination ONUs can 
recognize their frames after reading the LLID. Therefore, 
when the PBU is buffered inside the ONU, in the mean time 
OLT might starts sending packets on call arrival for an idle 
MT to the previous serving MAG as the Layer 3 binding 
table has not been updated yet at the LMA. Consequently, it 
can cause long startup latency because in such case LMA 
needs to retransmit those packets for that idle MT through 
the PON network. Otherwise, the ONU of that MA somehow 
needs to forward to the serving ONU (collocated MAG). An 
ONU can forward those packets when architecture like [7] is 
deployed.  
 
B. Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) Location Update: 
In PMIP, there are two important functional units: LMA 
and MAG. Any packet for an MT must come first at the 
LMA. A LMA knows the serving MAG for that MT. 
  
①.  LMA Working Description: 
Packets send by other nodes to the destination MT are 
received at the LMA within and beyond the PMIP‘s domain 
[8]. LMA creates and maintains a binding table, which keeps 
the record of each MT and the corresponding MAG. On 
packets arrival for an MT, the LMA encapsulates the 
incoming packets with Proxy-CoA of the serving MAG and 
then forwards them towards the MAG. LMA also 
decapsulates the outgoing packets from MT by removing 
LMA address (LMAA) and forwarding the packet towards 
its destination. It is important to mention that PMIP standard 
does not consider the status of an MT in LMA (idle or 
active). 
 
②. MAG Working Description:  
Any incoming and outgoing packet of an MT should pass 
through MAG. MAG plays the role of the router on point-to-
point link [8]. MAG encapsulates the packets with LMAA 
before sending it to LMA and also decapsulates the packet 
when it receives from the LMA.    
C. Ethernet Passive Optical Network in Brief: 
In EPON, an OLT is the centralized intelligence. It 
receives the packets from core network and then delivers to 
the destination ONU through optical fiber. OLT marks the 
frames with LLID so that ONUs can recognize their 
corresponding frames [15, 16, 18]. If the LLID matches, an 
ONU retrieves the frames and then processes. While it 
discards if the LLID does not match. For unicasting point of 
view, each ONU used to have single unique LLID, however, 
for broadcasting or multicasting they can have common 
LLIDs. In EPON, when an OLT transmits a frame conveyed 
by a wavelength 1
  it is splitted by a passive splitter which 
258

situates at a remote node as shown in Fig. 1. And then the 
same frame is directed to the all ONUs through fiber. 
Usually the splitting ration is 1: n, where n can be 16 or 32 
or 64.  
D. Idle Mode Operation in WiMaX: 
   When there is no incoming or outgoing packet for a 
certain amount of time Tth, an MT moves from active mode 
to idle mode to save battery power. Fig. 2 states the state 
transition diagram. WiMAX (e.g., IEEE 802.16e) has three 
mobility entities for managing idle mode and paging 
operation [1, 17]. These include: paging agent (PA), paging 
controller (PC), and paging grouping (PG). PC can be 
collocated in a MAG or in a BS [1]. PC performs the task of 
observing the activities of all MTs located in particular 
Paging Group. An idle MT periodically wakes up and 
listens whether it has any downlink packet or not.

E. Existing Solutions for Location Update: 
 Many of the researchers have considered idle-mode 
condition of MTs in Mobile IP environment. They propose 
to reduce Layer 3 location update cost when an MT is in 
idle mode by adopting different approaches.   
For example, in [13], the authors suggest to delay the 
PMIP location update till a call arrives for an idle MT.  And 
when a packet arrives, LMA forwards it to new-MAG via 
old-MAG. It is because this scheme does not allow Layer 3 
location update as long as the MT is in idle mode. However, 
when the distance between the old-MAG and the new-MAG 
is long, MT experiences a long startup latency and 
additional signaling burden at MAGs.  
In [14], the authors indicate that Layer 3 location update 
should be performed at every MAG. We named this scheme 
in this paper as per-MAG location update (PML). This 
scheme reduces startup latency because Layer 3 routing 
information is refreshed whenever an MT visit a new MA. 
However, it also increases location update signaling cost.  
In [2], a distance based approach is mentioned. After 
crossing a predefined distance (d) PC, which is the Layer 2 
mobility agent of IEEE 802.16e, invokes the MAG to 
conduct Layer 3 location update. This mechanism can 
reduce the number of Layer 3 location update significantly. 
However, it has some drawbacks. For example, with the 
increase of predefined d, startup latency also increases. This 
is because the startup latency is a function of distance 
between o-MAG and n-MAG [2].  
As a matter of fact, existing solutions proposed in [2, 13, 
14] cannot be used for reducing Layer 3 location update 
signaling cost for idle MTs in OWIAN. This is because 
those solutions were made considering a wired network 
architecture. Adopting those in OWIAN, there might be 
improper operation. For example, solution in [2] needs 
retunneling between old-MAG and new-MAG. In fact, it is 
not possible in typical PON architecture as an ONU here 
communicates with other ONUs through the OLT. 
Therefore, if aforementioned procedure is followed startup 
latency supposed to be increased.  
 
III. 
PROPOSED LOCATION UPDATE MECHANSIM IN THE 
OWIAN 
In this paper, our objective is to develop a protocol in 
such a way that can eliminate Layer 3 location update 
during the inter-call arrival time (MT‘s idle period) and can 
forward the packets of an idle MT on call arrival properly in 
the OWIAN.  
   We consider that when time between two call arrivals 
for an MT crosses Tth, OLT assumes that the MT is in idle 
mode. We further assume that in that EPON network 
domain another kind of LLID is used for only the idle MTs‘ 
packets. In other words it can said that the OLT marks all 
the idle MTs‘ frame with a special LLID (SLLID) and this 
SLLID is known to all ONUs in the OWIAN. Therefore, 
whenever an ONU receives any frame marked with that 
SLLID, it opens that frame. Note that the reason behind the 
SLLID is if the OLT marks the packets based on serving 
MAG, OLT might forward to the wrong ONU. The reason 
is that after Layer 3 location update an MT may not stay in 
the same MA.  
On the other hand, in the proposed solution an idle MT 
only performs Layer 2 location update in the wireless access 
network domain with the PC, which is collocated with the 
MAG, through the serving BS as shown in Fig. 1. And 
Layer 3 location update at LMA is postponed as long as the 
MT is in idle mode. So that signaling cost for Layer 3 
location update can be saved. The following paragraphs 
explain how proposed mechanism works.  
(i) The idle MT moves from one MA to another MA, 
without performing any Layer 3 location update.  
(ii) When call comes for any MT at the OLT, OLT 
resolves status of the MT (idle/active) from Tth. If the MT is 
in idle mode OLT sends those packets after marking with 
that SLLID. Otherwise, OLT assumes that MT is active and 
it is in the same MA from where last Layer 3 location 
update was conducted. In fact, there is still chance that 
active MT might move to another MA within that
tmove
, 
where

. However, we avoid such scenario in this 
paper.  
(iii) If the MT is active, the OLT resolves the 
corresponding LLID of that ONU from the Proxy-CoA of 
the serving MAG and then forwards the packets after 
marking with that LLID. The following algorithm states 
how the OLT makes decision on arrival of a call. 
259

(iv) On the other hand, when an ONU receives a frame 
marked with SLLID, it extracts the packets inside. Then, it 
invokes collocated PC asking all the idle MTs‘ lists of its 
MA. PC provides the list in reply. If the ONU finds any 
packet which is destined for any one of these idle MTs, it 
requests PC to page that MT to wakeup. After successful 
paging, idle MT switches from idle mode to active mode. 
Then, those destined packets are forwarded through the 
serving BS to that MT.

(v) When the idle MTs wakeup and start receiving 
packets, ONU can collect all the PBU messages for Layer 3 
location update from the collocated MAG, and then can 
transmit to the OLT during dedicated uplink transmission 
slot.  
(vi) On arrival of PBUs at OLT, OLT sends those to 
collocated LMA. And finally LMA updates its binding table 
(Layer 3 location update is performed).

NUMERICAL 
MODELING 
AND 
PERFORMANCE 
ANALYSIS 
In this part, we are interested to know how these location 
update protocols proposed in [2, 14] perform between two 
call arrivals when they are dispensed in an OWIAN. Similar 
to [2, 10], we consider that location update cost is the 
amount of resources spent for managing mobility of an MT. 
It might be possible that network operators can consider 
relative cost spent at a mobility agent (e.g., LMA, MAGs, 
OLT) for tracking an MT. For example, resources spent for 
processing a signaling message, amount of bandwidth 
consumes for transiting that signaling message.  
We draw the previous OWIAN architecture depicted in 
Fig. 1 again in Fig. 4, for numerical modeling. Similar to 
[10-12], the parameters are defined as follows for numerical 
analysis:  
 
  : Call arrival rate follows Poisson process.

We assume that trip of an idle MT starts from the point 
m as shown Fig. 4. Similar to [10], it is also considered here 
that signaling cost for transmitting a signaling message is 
proportional to the distance between source and destination 
node. And the proportional is

As mentioned before DBLU does not suggest Layer 3 
location update always, rather it makes Layer 3 location 
update after crossing a predefined distance d. Therefore, 
based on the inter call arrival time, DBLU can have three 
different location update signaling cost. First, if a call comes 
at every MA, then DBLU must do Layer 3 location update at 
all MAs (a). Second, calls come at the time when idle MT 
crosses predefined distance (b). And finally, a call comes in 
MA where DBLU does not suggest performing Layer 3 
location update as the predefined distance has not been 
crossed by that idle MT (c).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
Our proposed mechanism helps to fully utilize the 
advantage of idle mode. In this mechanism, an idle MT does 
not need to wakeup for conducting Layer 3 location update; 
therefore they can stay in idle mode only by performing 
Layer 2 location update in the wireless access network 
domain. Besides, mainly it contributes a great deal of 
reduction of Layer 3 location update signaling messages in 
OWIAN. In our future work, we would like to evaluate the 
performance of proposed mechanism at different residence 
time of an idle MT.
