Abstract—The paper evaluates the capacity of a cognitive
user in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based
spectrum sharing communication system that assumes ran-
dom subcarrier allocation and absence of spectrum sensing
information at the secondary (cognitive) user. In the absence
of the primary user’s channel occupation information, i.e.,
no spectrum sensing mechanism is used, the secondary user
randomly accesses the subcarriers of the primary network and
collides with the primary users’ subcarriers. The capacity of
a secondary user under such a random access that assumes
subcarrier collisions is evaluated herein paper and used as a
performance benchmark to investigate the proposed commu-
nication scheme over the Rayleigh fading channel.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent measurements have highlighted that the radio
frequency (RF) spectrum is being under-utilized. Therefore,
the cognitive radio (CR) technology has recently received
huge interest because it has the potential to yield more
efﬁcient RF spectrum utilization [1]. This paper focuses on
evaluating the capacity of a cognitive user in an orthog-
onal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based under-
lay spectrum sharing communication system, where primary
users (PUs) are allocated a higher priority to access the RF
spectrum than secondary users (SUs), and the coexistence of
primary and secondary users is enabled under the PU’s pre-
deﬁned interference constraint [2], also called interference
temperature.
One of the critical issues faced in the adoption of CR
networks is to know whether at a certain physical location
and moment of time the RF spectrum is occupied by PU(s),
i.e., if there is a sensing mechanism in place for the available
spectrum [3], [4]. The challenge in deploying spectrum
sensing mechanisms is due to the uncertainties ranging from
channel randomness at device and network-level, hidden
primary users, and issues pertaining to sensing duration and
security [5].
Because of the difﬁculties faced in the acquisition of
the spectrum sensing information, this paper focuses on
assessing the capacity of a cognitive user in an OFDM-based
CR spectrum sharing communication system that assumes
random allocation and absence of the PU’s channel occupa-
tion information, i.e., lack of spectrum sensing information.
In other words, the SU’s subcarriers are allowed to collide
with PUs’ subcarriers. As a major beneﬁt of the proposed
random access scheme, random subcarrier utilization helps
to uniformly distribute the SU’s interference among the
PUs’ subcarriers, and hence, to equalize uniformly the
performance of all cognitive users across the whole network.
So far, no studies have been reported to assess the effects
of subcarrier collisions in OFDM-based cognitive spectrum
sharing systems. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more
comprehensive system analysis including the development of
a stochastic model to capture the subcarrier collisions and
protection of the operation of PUs in OFDM-based cognitive
systems.
The outcomes of the analysis conducted herein paper will
help in understanding the performance limits of random
access OFDM-based cognitive communication systems and
could be also utilized as performance benchmarks to assess
the performance of other cognitive spectrum sharing systems
that assume the availability of spectrum sensing information.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the notations and assumptions that will be used
throughout this paper, and describes the basic features of the
adopted OFDM-based cognitive radio system. Section III is
dedicated to the evaluation of the capacity of a secondary
cognitive user in the presence of subcarrier collisions and
Rayleigh ﬂat fading channels. Computer simulations corrob-
orating the proposed capacity evaluation study are presented
in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the paper with
some future possible extensions of the current results.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In the considered system model, the primary and cognitive
(secondary) networks consist of N PUs with a primary base
station (PBS), and M SUs with a secondary base station
(SBS), respectively. To preserve the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of PUs in the proposed random access OFDM
spectrum sharing communication system, the interference

power levels caused by the SU-transmitters at the primary
receiver (PBS) are enforced to be smaller than a predeﬁned
interference temperature (IT) (Ψi) at the i-th subcarrier.
The channel power gains from the mth SU to SBS and
PBS are represented in terms of variables hm and hmp,
respectively. Also, gn and gns denote the channel power
gains from the nth PU to PBS and SBS, respectively. All
the channel gains are assumed to have unit mean and be
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) ﬂat Rayleigh
fading random variables. It is also supposed that perfect
information about the interference channel power gains,
hmp, is available at SUs. The SU can access the channel
side information (CSI), through various means such as
the channel reciprocity condition [6], [7], mediate band
mechanism or cognitive radio network manager that co-
ordinates the operation of PBS and SU [2]. The thermal
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at PUs and SUs is
assumed circularly symmetric complex Gaussian stochastic
process with zero mean and variance η, i.e., CN (0, η). The
parameters hm,i, hmp,i, gn,i and gns,i will represent the
channel power gains associated with the ith subcarrier.
The total number of available subcarriers in the primary
network is denoted by F. The subcarrier set of each PU is
assigned by ensuring the orthogonality among the sets of
subcarriers for all PUs, F P
n for n = 1, . . . , N. SU randomly
accesses the subcarriers from the available subcarriers set F
without knowing which channels (subcarriers) are occupied
by PUs. Therefore, SU will collide with the subcarriers
of the PUs with a certain probability. The probabilistic
model adopted for the number of subcarrier collisions is
very general and follows a multivariate hypergeometric
distribution. During the evaluation study of the SU capacity
(to be described in Section III), it will be assumed that there
is only a single SU (which can be any SU in the system)
in the cognitive network. The reason for focusing on such
a simpliﬁed set-up is because such a framework enables to
conduct a more simpliﬁed analysis without introducing a
very cumbersome and hard-to-follow analysis, and to draw
very general conclusions. In the same time, the proposed
framework can be easily extended to multiple SUs with the
assumption of no mutual interference among SUs.
III. COGNITIVE USER CAPACITY ANALYSIS
A. Secondary User Capacity with Subcarrier Collisions
The Rayleigh fading channel model is adopted to inves-
tigate the impact on performance of the system parameters
and to evaluate the expressions for the probability density
function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of SU capacity. We will focus ﬁrst on the SU capacity
expression with subcarrier collisions.
1) Probability Mass Function of the Number of Sub-
carrier Collisions: If any arbitrary (consider the mth) SU
randomly accesses F S
m subcarriers from a set of F available
subcarriers without replacement while ∑N
n=1 F P
n subcarriers
are being used by the N PUs, then the joint probability mass
function (PMF) of the number of subcarrier collisions, km,
follows the modiﬁed multivariate hypergeometric distribu-
tion:
p(km) =
( Ff
kfm
)( F
F S
m
)−1
N
∏
n=1
( F P

where the notation
(·
·
)
stands for the binomial coefﬁcient,
and km = [k1m, k2m, . . . , kNm, kfm]T ∈ ZN+1
0+
represents
the number of collisions of the mth SU with N PUs and
with the collision-free subcarriers, kfm. Parameter Ff =
F − ∑N
n=1 F P
n stands for the number of free subcarriers.
2) Capacity with Collisions: Let knm denote the number
of (mth) SU’s subcarriers that collide with the nth PU’s sub-
carriers, then the capacity of SU with subcarrier collisions
can be expressed as:
Cm =
k1m
∑
i=1

where SI,n
m,i and SNI
m,i represent the signal-to-interference
plus noise ratio (SINR) for the ith subcarrier of the mth
SU with “interference” and “no-interference” from the nth
PU, respectively. We make the remark that SNI
m,i is indeed the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the ith subcarrier. However,
throughout this paper to emphasize the subcarrier collision
and collision-free cases, it will be referred to as the SINR
with “no-interference” from PU. All logarithms herein paper
are with respect to Euler’s constant e.
B. Cognitive Capacity over Rayleigh Fading Channels
The peak power interference constraint is considered
herein paper, and an adaptive scheme is used to adjust the
transmit power of SU to preserve the QoS of PUs. Hence,
the transmit power of the mth SU corresponding to the ith
subcarrier is given by P T
m,i = min {Pm,i, Ψi/hmp,i} , for
i = 1, . . . , F.
Deﬁne the variable λm,i := hm,iP T
m,i, then the received
SINR of the mth SU’s ith subcarrier takes the form:
SI,n
m,i =
λm,i
IP
n,i + η ,
for n = 1, . . . , N,
(3)
where IP
n,i = Pn,igns,i denotes the mutual interference
caused by nth PU on the ith subcarrier. In (3), SI,n
m,i
represents the SINR when subcarrier collision happens.
Therefore, when there is no collision, i.e., the subcarrier is
73

not being used by two users, there is no interference caused
by PUs. Thus, SNI
m,i = λm,i/η.
The PDF and CDF of SNI

Finally, the desired expressions for the PDFs of CI,n
m,i
and CNI
m,i can be obtained through the transformation of
appropriately deﬁned RVs as follows:
fCI,n
m,i(x) =

 fSI,n
m,i(y)

y=ex−1
= exfSI,n
m,i(ex − 1),
fCNI
m,i(x) = exfSNI
m,i(ex − 1).
Recalling the SU capacity expression in (2), in the pres-
ence of N interfering PUs, there are two types of well known
methods available to evaluate the distribution for sum of
variates, namely, the characteristic function (CF) and the
moment generating function (MGF) method. Unfortunately,
employing these methods leads to intractable results and no
explicit closed form expressions for the PDF and CDF of
SU capacity in (2) can be achieved.
We will resort in this regard to an alternative approach.
To sum up the rates for the cases of interference and
no-interference, we will approximate the PDFs of CI,n
m,i
and CNI
m,i using the Gamma distribution. There are several
desirable properties of the Gamma distribution that are ﬁt
for approximating the PDFs of the variables CI,n
m,i and CNI
m,i.
First, the sum of Gamma distributed RVs with the same
scale parameters is another Gamma distributed RVs. Second,
the skewness and tail of distribution are similar for the
whole range of interest and are determined by mean and
variance [9]. Last but not least, Gamma distribution is a
Type-III Pearson distribution, which is widely used in ﬁtting
positive RVs [9], [10]. In addition, since Gamma distribution
is uniquely determined by its mean and variance, we will
make use of the moment matching method to match the
ﬁrst two moments of the RV, namely its mean and variance.
Deﬁnition 1: Random variable X follows a Gamma dis-
tribution, X ∼ G(α, β) with scale and shape parameters β >
0 and α > 0, respectively, if: fX(x) =
xα−1 exp(− x
β)
βαΓ(α)
U(x),
where U(·) represents the unit step function, and the Gamma
function is deﬁned as Γ(x) =
∫ ∞
0
tx−1e−tdt.
Since the mean and variance of Gamma distribution are
αβ and αβ2, respectively, matching the ﬁrst two moments
with the PDFs of CI,n
m,i and CNI
m,i leads to

where the second equality is obtained by using integration
by parts [11]. The resulting integral is estimated via Gauss-
Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ), where the weights (wj) and
abscissas (sj) are given by [12, Eqs. (22) and (23)], re-
spectively. Similarly, the variance of CNI
m,i is expressed by
adopting the same approach.
Based on the adopted Gamma approximation, the capac-
ities are approximated as CI,n
m,i ∼ G

and CNI
m,i ∼

In Figure 1, the exact and approximative expressions of
fCI,n
m,i(x) and fCNI
m,i(x), including the simulations results, for
different system parameters are depicted. It can be observed
that the proposed approximation is very close to the exact
results. Since both CI,n
m,i and CNI
m,i are i.i.d. for given knm,
the conditional characteristic functions for the rate sums
∑knm
i=1 CI
m,i and ∑kfm
i=1 CNI
m,i can be expressed as follows
ΦCI,n
m (ω|knm) =
(

nknm ,
ΦCNI
m (ω|knm) =

m,i(ω)
)kfm =
(

where ΦCI,n
m,i(ω|knm) and ΦCNI
m,i(ω|knm) are the character-
istic functions of fCI,n
m,i(x|knm) and fCNI
m,i(x|knm), respec-
tively. Using the property of the Gamma distribution that
the sum of i.i.d. Gamma distributed RVs, with the same
scale parameters (β) is another Gamma distributed RV, the
conditional PDFs take the form:
fCI,n
m |knm(x|knm) = G
(
αI
nknm, βI
n
)
,
fCNI
m |knm(x|knm) = G
(
αNIkfm, βNI)
.
(4)
In (2), even though the conditional PDFs of CI,n
m
and
CNI
m
are calculated, to ﬁnd the PDF expression for Cm, one
ﬁrst needs to evaluate the PDF of CI
m, and then the PDF of
its sum with CNI
m . Notice that there are N + 1 terms in (2),
and each follows a Gamma distribution where the shape (α)
and scale (β) parameters can be arbitrary. Therefore, the
aforementioned property of Gamma distribution for a sum
of Gamma variates cannot be employed anymore.
The expression for the PDF of a sum of Gamma RVs was
obtained by Moschopoulos in [13], where a mathematically
tractable solution that does not restrict the scale and shape
parameters to be integer-valued or all distinct is presented.
Therefore, the following theorem will be used next.
Theorem 1 (Moschopoulos, 1985): Let {Xs}S
s=1 be inde-
pendent but not necessarily identically distributed Gamma
variates with parameters αs and βs, respectively, then the
PDF of Y = ∑S
s=1 Xs can be expressed as

where δ0 = 1, and for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Proof: See [13].
The Moschopoulos PDF provides a tractable representa-
tion for the sum of Gamma variates in terms of a single
Gamma series via a recursive formula to evaluate iteratively
the representation coefﬁcients. This approach is applicable
for any arbitrary shape parameters {αs}S
s=1 and scale pa-
rameters {βs}S
s=1 including the possibility of having some
of the parameters identical. Notice that in the considered
communication system, with some probability the transmit
power of PUs Pn,i for n = 1, . . . , N, can be the same, which
means that the corresponding αI
n and βI
n are the same. Such
a set-up might arise when the PUs are at the same distance
from their corresponding common PBS.

may consider the ﬁrst h, i.e., k = h − 1, terms in the

Now, the PDF of Cm can be determined by averaging
over the PMF of subcarrier collisions:
fCm(x) =
∑
km
fCm,Km(x, km)
=
∑
km
fCm|Km(x|km)p(km).

Plugging (1) and (8) into (10) yields the sought PDF in
(9).
The outage probability is a often used performance metric
in channels subject to fading conditions. Hence, herein paper
we will determine the outage probability of SU capacity in
terms of P out
Cm (φth) = Pr (Cm < φth) =
∫ φth
0
fCm(x)dx,
which represents the CDF of the SU capacity over the outage
threshold φth [dB].
Using (7) and (9), the CDF of Cm takes the form:

IV. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
The inﬂuence of the secondary user peak transmit power
Pm,i (in dB) on its average capacity (in nats per second per
hertz) is illustrated for different values of IT Ψi in Fig. 2.
It turns out that the cognitive user’s average capacity gets
saturated after a certain value of peak SU transmit power
because of the IT constraint. Fig. 2 corroborates the fact that
the analytical results agree well with the simulation results.

The plots in Figure 2 are in the presence of a single PU,
i.e., n ∈ [1, N], and unit variance AWGN (η = 1). The
number of subcarriers in sets F, F S
m and F S
n is selected
arbitrarily. Fig. 2 highlights also the fact that the saturation
level of capacity increases as the IT constraint relaxes, and
the capacity keeps growing until a saturation level as the
transmit power of SU increases. However, the capacity gains
due to the relaxation in the IT constraint disappears in the
low SU transmit power regime.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper assessed the capacity of a secondary (cog-
nitive) user in a random access OFDM-based cognitive
radio system with spectrum sharing features such as random
subcarrier allocation and absence of spectrum sensing infor-
mation. The adopted model for the number of subcarrier col-
lisions in the presence of multiple interfering primary users
is the general multivariate hypergeometric distribution. The
PDF and CDF expressions of the secondary user capacity
over a Rayleigh fading channel are derived. It turns out that
the closed-form expression for the instantaneous secondary
user capacity over Rayleigh channel fading is intractable.
Therefore, a Gamma approximation of the secondary user
capacity is obtained by employing the moment matching
method and the concept of Moschopoulos PDF represen-
tation. The work conducted in this paper subscribes along
the lines of our preliminary results [8], and we are hoping
to extend these results to a more general OFDM-based
cognitive radio network that assumes an arbitrary number
of primary and secondary users, and general channel fading
conditions.
