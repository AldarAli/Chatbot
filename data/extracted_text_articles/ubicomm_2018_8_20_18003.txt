Abstract—Quilombolas are Brazilian traditional people who
are descendants of black slaves from Africa. The present
article discusses how technological tools can be used to help in
maintaining their use of medicinal plants, in a cultural vision,
to keep alive the history and culture experienced in two
Quilombola Communities in the Northern portion of Brazil. It
also treats environmental values as part of the history and
cultural
heritage
of
these
people
and
discusses
the
contributions
that
knowledge
of
telematics
can
provide
towards
turning a regional culture into a source for
ubiquitous knowledge. In this context, the importance of
preserving and valuing the knowledge of these communities
becomes urgent in the context of safeguarding the cultural
diversity existing in the world.
Keywords-Telematics; Culture; Quilombolas; Medicinal Plants;
Ubiquitous Knowledge.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Quilombola Communities are inserted in the concept of
"Traditional People and Communities" - TPC - according to
Quirino [1], and involve identity, historical, social and
cultural peculiarities. In Brazil, since passing of the Law
6040/2017 [2] that deals with a National Policy for the
Sustainable
Development
of
People
and
Traditional
Communities, conceptualization of the term TPC involves a
legal framework. The third article of this Law defines
traditional
communities
as
culturally
differentiated.
Furthermore,
it
presents
the
forms
of
their
social
organization. In addition, Quilombola as a TPC use
territories and natural resources as a means for cultural,
social,
religious,
ancestral
and
economic
perpetuation
through practices produced and transmitted via
tradition.
This provides a guarantee of environmental conservation of
their customs and institutions as fundamental rights defined
by national and international legal systems. The legal
instruments established in the country for
the purpose of
guaranteeing
the
cultural
protection
of
quilombola
communities also guarantee rights such as access to land,
productive inclusion, infrastructure, citizenship and quality
of life.
According to Vieira and Monteiro [3] estimates from
2004 indicated that Brazil had around 3000 Quilombola
Communities distributed throughout the entire Brazilian
territory, with
less than half being catalogued [4].
Officially, the Brazilian National Secretariat of Policies for
the Promotion of Racial Equality states that, by l 2013, the
Palmares Cultural Foundation (PFC) had certified 2040
quilombola communities [5], present in the five regions of
the country.
To be certified as a TPC it is necessary to request the
beginning of a territory recognition process, which involves
a Technical Report for Identification and Delimitation
(RTID), analysis and rulings on appeals related
to the
RTID, recognition, decree and referral, removal of illegal
occupants and titling.
According to more recent data
released for 2018 provided by PCF [6] Brazil has identified
3.051 remaining Communities of Quilombos, and has so far
issued 2.547 certificates of recognition.
The state of Tocantins is one of the 27 federative units of
Brazil, (NEDES) [7] located in the southeastern portion of
the North region, occupying an area of 277,620 km². The
state has 139 municipalities and its capital is the planned
city of Palmas. The traditional communities are dispersed
from north to south in the state of Tocantins. In Tocantins,
45 communities have been identified, of which 38 have a
certificate of recognition as a TPC.
Initially,
this
research
focuses
on
two
of
these
Communities: Malhadinha Quilombola Community, located
in the central region of the state, in the municipality of
Brejinho de Nazaré, 90 kilometers from Palmas, the capital
of the state; and São José Quilombola Community, in
Chapada da Natividade, 210 kilometers from the capital.
The research intends to demonstrate how technology can
help to maintain the culture of these communities, as a part
of environmental knowledge.
This paper is organized into the following parts: After
the Introduction, Section II presents relevant related works;

Section III presents the research proposal, showing the
interdisciplinary relation between technology and cultural
contents and materials and methods; and finally, Sections
IV and V present the results, conclusions and suggestions
for future work, highlighting how technology tools can help
the communities in other areas, such as agricultural control.

RELATED WORK
Technology is ubiquitously used nowadays and can
serve to turn local traditional knowledge into global
knowledge, since it can
provide solutions that offer
information to the most diverse areas and problems. The use
of mobile devices can be an example of that, playing a
fundamental role in this dissemination process.
Pereira et al. [8] argue that technology can be complex
to some people and that sometimes it is necessary to use
easier tools, such as applications.
Magalhães et al. [9] also presented the use of a mobile
App, created using an OpenSource tool, called AppSheet,
that is an easier tool for use by people without specialized
computing skills.
According to Santos et al. [10] mobile applications have
already been used
for environmental problems. They
demonstrate
the
use
of
a
mobile
application
for
environmental preservation.
Regarding Quilombola Communities, Tesk [11] states
that
although
globalization
tries
to
bring
cultural
homogeneity,
those
Quilombolas
resist
through
their
culture, although they sometimes re-signify it.
Regarding TCP and healing practices, Auger et al. [12]
say that it is important to have and provide access to
traditional health care practices.
Thus, in order to continue pointing towards the use of
mobile applications for social problem-solving in the path of
mobility, this work presents a cultural catalog of medicinal
plants, used as an alternative treatment for diseases, through
the use of an App called FitoQuilombo.
III.
PROPOSAL
The objective of this research is to solve a social
problem
in
the
environmental/cultural
area,
using
technology as a support to aid in maintaining local tradition,
by creating an application that can connect people and
record
Quilombola medicinal plants in a collaborative
catalog. It presents two Quilombola Communities, both in
the state of Tocantins, and the way they use medicinal
plants, as an alternative method for treating diseases.
This research is based on two Quilombola Communities
chosen by preliminary information and access provided by
two
researchers
of
this
group
who
are
themselves
Quilombolas.
To solve the problem, the research group created an App
that provides cultural information about use of medicinal
plants by Quilombolas. The main challenges in doing this is
that the communities do not have the appropriate access to
technology, besides the fact that most young people, who
are probably better at dealing with new technology, leave
the community at an early age to study.
To identify how the tradition of using medicinal plants
for disease treatments is culturally passed on, the authors
need to register some plants, their therapeutic purposes, the
best form of use and how Quilombolas prescribe them
through a prior
data collection with the members of
Malhadinha and São João communities.
Because of the growing number of people with interest
in medicinal plants, the App will be available to all people,
providing anyone
from anywhere in the world access the
cultural catalog, which can facilitate the interaction of the
public interested in obtaining the necessary information on
medicinal plants, and sharing this cultural legacy.
This shows that telematics tools can directly help to
maintain cultural knowledge, providing an evolution in
aiding human social relations, and helping part of this
process.
A. Materials
As mentioned before, one of the products from this
research is an App called FitoQuilombo, developed using
AppSheet [13], a free platform. The tool includes a catalog
with
Quilombola
information,
photos,
and
videos
of
medicinal
plants,
demonstrating
how
those
people
traditionally prepare and use them, with a brief presentation
of each community (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Presentation of communities.
The research was initially developed through meetings
in the computer lab of the Federal Institute of Education,
Science and Technology of Tocantins, Palmas Campus,
using computers with Internet access, to carry out research

on the project with the support of a tutor, who shared
configuration techniques for creating
a file with the
commands and procedures to transform a machine with the
Linux operating system into an access point.
Other tools were used for interaction between the
research group and the tutor, enabling support from instant
messaging Apps such as WhatsApp [14], and platform tools
such as Google Family [15]: Classroom [16], Gmail [17],
Forms [18], Drive [19], Doc's [20], Presentations [21],
YouTube [22], and Screencasting [23].
To explore the possibility of using
the Linux [24]
operating system tools, the authors used the command
terminal
to
develop
a
container
docker,
thinking
of
information from the project that will be stored. Work was
done to configure a container docker and to install tools that
provide a solution for the work, which was defined by the
group. Still using the resources of the Linux command
terminal, a draft of the solution proposed for the problem
presented in the classroom was implemented by the tutor; he
executed commands to access the server, change the
password and access one of the machines in the laboratory,
creating a subnet docker and a container connected to this
subnet by installing net-tools.
B. Methods
This is a work in progress, using Problem Based
Learning – PBL – as an initial method, where a problem is
given and solutions are sought.
During the bibliographical research of related work, it
was possible to identify a range of solutions, which apply to
the problem that was identified. In this way, an application
was designed that contains a catalog of medicinal plants,
with an indication of use of these plants, in a collaborative
context with the two communities, to offer information on
the most diverse medicinal plants and indications for
treating diseases.
A preliminary survey was carried out in Malhadinha
Quilombola Community, with 64 families and 476 people.
The research identified that in this community it is possible
to have access to Internet, via mobile data, with a stable
signal and some specific points in the community receiving
a more stable signal. The community people have 16
smartphones used by the Quilombos.
The researchers investigated the empirical knowledge of
medicinal plants available in the community, to learn what
medicinal plants are in fact used for therapeutic treatment.
Of the 64 families in the community, 22 were interviewed to
identify which medicinal plants are used; the researchers
identified 46 medicinal plants: Mastruz, Babosa, Quebra
Pedra, Tipi, Gengibre, Açafrão, Arnica, Arruda, Alecrim,
Boldo, Cagaita, Hortelã, Inhame, Urucu, Unha de Gato,
Manjericão, Arnica, Capim de Cheiro, Erva Cidreira,
Laranja da Terra, Mulatinha,
Alfavaca, Vinagreira,
Açoita-cavalo, Cajá, Jatobá do campo, Pequi, Mangabeira,
Mangaba, Cansanção, Fedegoso, Tamarindo, Inharé, São
Caetano, Abacate, Negramina, Aroeira, Sucupira, Algodão,
Assa Peixe, Amora, Cabelo de Milho, Jaborandi, Língua de
Vaca, Noni and Quina.
The FitoQuilombo App was developed on the AppSheet
platform, with the help of spreadsheets created in Google
Docs, which are formatted according to their use on App
screens. Within the platform itself, there is a support area,
where documentation is found to aid in setting up and
adjusting the application. This documentation is presented
in the form of text and video tutorials.
In the process of structuring the application it has a
catalog of plants and herbs, which helps the user to know
which plants and their parts to use for treating diseases and
to perform tests and surveys with potential users of the
application.
In addition to the configuration and development part,
we use research to support this applied methodology. These
searches are primarily done in other sites, and within the
AppSheet development program itself, which has a library
with
documentation
help
as
well
as
tutorials
that
demonstrate
the
development
of
the
proposed
functionalities, enhancing the application so that it performs
the functions as desired.
Research was also carried out, with the help of a form
created in Google Forms, where questions related to the use
and application of herbal medicines contained in the
application were made. The objective of this research was to
evaluate the design of the system and also the relevance of
creating this type of application, which is to inform the end
users about the importance of preserving both the culture
and the plants used in the preparation of these herbal
products. This will be part of the FitoQuilombo virtual
catalog. Given the results obtained with the research done
through this online questionnaire, it is already possible to
establish the need to design software of this nature, as the
respondents desire.
Through analysis of the data obtained with these
surveys, the need to make the interface of the application as
intuitive and straightforward as possible was verified, since
the users who will enter data to compose the catalog of
plants of the system may be individuals who do not have
much
familiarity
with
mobile
network
technologies
(smartphones and tablets), and
may experience some
difficulty in adding more items to the system.
This
impediment
can
easily be
remedied
through
guidelines on how to use the system, along with users who
are part of the communities that will supply the application
library with the registration of therapeutically valuable
plants found in the communities that are part of this
analysis.

RESULTS
This paper had the intention of providing contributions
as to how technology can serve as a s tool to maintain
cultural identity in Quilombola Communities, focusing on

registering their cultural use of medicinal plants through an
App called FitoQuilombo.
Its purpose was to help transmit, teach and preserve
Quilombola culture on a daily basis, creating alternatives
that optimize the process of maintaining the local culture. It
may be possible to adapt it for use by other traditional
peoples around the world.
The registration of medicinal plants in FitoQuilombo
App is described only culturally. These partial results were
collected by bibliographical researches, previous visits to
the communities, interface usability test of the App,
information and application navigation, which allowed for
improvements
in
the
organization
of
the
application
structure.
The researchers tested the FitoQuilombo App with
pharmacists and natural product users, and applied a
heuristic
usability
assessment,
presenting
some
considerations about the usability of the App prototype,
using heuristics as basis for the decision, generating an
order of analysis of the 10 Nielsen heuristics [25], on
interface design, information, and navigation. Together with
the navigation designer, they then analyzed the visibility of
the application
system
with
the
argument
that
the
application does not have information on where the user is
browsing, meaning what screen the user is on. In possession
of these considerations, we realized that one must insert
titles in each screen in order to identify the screen on which
the user is; in this case, the project will make changes to
their screens, including the titles.
In analyzing the application, specifically in heuristic 10
concerning the help and documentation presented by the
application, it was reported that: "The application does not
have a 7- help menu or tutorial on how to use, or how it
should work for a collaborator to send or register an alert".
Based on this analysis, we emphasize what the group was
already trying to put into practice, which is the provision of
a tutorial to assist in user navigation, explaining the main
steps, how to register an herbal medicine and how to send
opinions to the designers of the application.
Mobile devices have a fundamental role in this process
of information dissemination, enabling interaction with the
world. The goal of FitoQuilombo is to allow the user to
have
a
satisfactory
experience
when
opening
the
application. He or she should be able, when using his
catalog of herbs and medicinal plants, to carry out research
for indicating a treatment for a particular disease and to be
sure that this operation was done with confidence and
responsibility in the information. Also, that the application
is made available on hosting platforms, for users to
download, and that the application fulfills its role without
presenting technical problems that should have been solved
during its development.
The FitoQuilombo project, presents an interface design,
menus with two levels of depth to make usability accessible
and
direct,
in
interaction
with
clear
and
objective
information in order to facilitate user navigation. A fault has
been identified, which is the lack of title in each screen, as
can be seen in the figure below:
The home screen of the application provides the menu of
the home screen itself and the "medicinal plants" menu,
allowing access to the catalog of medicinal plants. In the
upper right-hand corner, there is the option of retrieving
information contained within the application (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Application Home Screen.
The system contains submenus in which there is
lateralized right-hand drop-down menu, with the following
functions:
"indication",
"Quilombola
Communities",
"videos", "contact”, “quilombola", "about" (Figure 3).
Figure 3. The layout of the menus.
The screen of the application provides images of the
plants followed by their popular and scientific names; when
accessing the image, it is possible to visualize and register
the medicinal plants in the communities surveyed, providing
information regarding indications, and mode of use by
Quilombos (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Catalog of medicinal plants.
The data obtained through the field research, for the
development of the application, was used to produce a
catalog of herbs and medicinal plants surveyed together
with the Quilombola Communities; having this data, opens
options for other works. Due to the unavailability of
scientific research and the time needed to complete this
project, scientific research of herbs and medicinal plants is
recommended for future work, in search of validation of
accessible knowledge, providing technical support to the
communities involved.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Most activities for treating illness in the Quilombola
Communities of Malhadinha and São José da Natividade in
the state of Tocantins, can employ apps such as the one
developed in this work as a viable alternative form of
support for keeping the Quilombola culture alive in terms
of its use of medicinal plants, along with
technological
growth among the people. A technology was sought to work
collaboratively with the empirical knowledge of Quilombos,
who are seeking alternative treatment for diseases.
At present, there is a growing number of people who
seek herbal treatment, so an application has been designed
that presents the recommendations, administration, and use
of medicinal plants that are culturally used as an alternative
treatment in the Communities. The conclusion is that
technology is an excellent ally in disseminating information
that contributes to society and that the empirical knowledge
of Quilombos regarding medicinal plants can contribute to
society.
Only some of the stated objectives we had proposed for
this
project
were
achieved.
Due
to
the
lack
of
communication via Internet it was not possible to test the
application in the Communities described in order for them
to use and feed this instrument.
This work is very relevant to environmental and cultural
research in relation to the globalization of cultures, which
depends on the technology that is the means for connecting
us even at long distances. This issue needs to be deepened,
because it allows a better understanding of this unification
process.
The
culture
experienced
in
Quilombola
Communities is a local culture with its own identities, and
we have been enabled to better understand their use of
medicinal
plants
and
to
develop
research,
selection,
organization,
and
information
communication
skills
obtained with each Quilombola community.
This phase of the research deals with the partial survey
of the results obtained with the study carried out on the need
to catalog and keep alive the Quilombola culture, with its
knowledge of medicinal plants that is passed on between
generations by the members of the community and the form
in
which
the
authors
presented
their
proposal
for
cataloguing and disseminating these teachings.
Future work could be done by testing the results of the
App use by the Quilombolas communities, and also with
further investigation of technology that can help organic
production, as well as with automation of the irrigation of
medicinal herbal gardens, avoiding the excess and waste of
human and natural resources.
