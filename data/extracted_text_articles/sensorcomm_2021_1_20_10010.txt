Abstractâ€” A contactless, wireless and battery-free alternating 
current (AC) apparent power and power factor sensor was 
developed. A current sensing transformer was not only used as 
a noncontact current sensor but also acted as a power supply for 
the sensor. The AC voltage waveform was measured without 
metal contacts using a piezoelectric film. A low-power circuit 
was designed to measure the power factor from the current and 
voltage waveforms. The data obtained from the developed 
sensor showed good agreement with the results from a 
commercially available power meter. The sensor developed in 
this work is expected to enable energy savings and carbon 
dioxide reduction in industrial applications.

INTRODUCTION
Reduction of electrical power consumption remains a 
constant issue in factories because it will not only reduce 
manufacturing costs but will also reduce CO2 emissions 
[1][2] and thus enable compliance with the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard [3]. 
To achieve the required reduction, it is important to measure 
the power consumption of each item of equipment precisely 
[4]. For this purpose, compact, easy-to-install, and 
inexpensive wireless power consumption sensors are required, 
but at present, there is no sensor available that can achieve all 
these demands [5]-[10]. Several nonmetallic contact methods 
for voltage waveform measurement have been proposed [11]-
[14] that offer the advantages of ease of installation and non-
invasive techniques. However, these proposed methods are 
expensive or require multiple probes that make them difficult 
to implement.
In this study, we propose a non-metal-contact voltage 
measurement method based on a single probe using a 
piezoelectric film. In addition, we have fabricated and 
evaluated 
an 
energy-harvesting, 
non-invasive, 
and 
retrofittable wireless power consumption sensor for factory 
use that consists of the proposed voltage sensor, a current 
transformer, an energy-harvesting circuit, a power-factor (PF) 
measurement circuit and a wireless communication module. 
The device does not require complex electrical work, and it 
will cost approximately $20 because of its simple design. 
In Section 2, the block diagram of our sensor is presented. 
Section
3 
describes 
the 
non-metal-contact 
voltage 
measurement process using the piezoelectric film. Section 4 
presents the PF measurement circuit. Section 5 shows the 
results from field tests. Section 6 presents the conclusions 
drawn from this study.
II.
CONFIGURATION OF THE SENSOR
The configuration of the developed sensor is shown in 
Figure 1. We used a current transformer to measure the current 
in a contact-free manner. The operating power of the wireless 
module can also be obtained from the current transformer. The 
sensor can be powered by energy harvesting. The apparent 
power was calculated by multiplying the assumed-to-be-
constant voltage by the measured current. The PF was 
calculated using the phase difference between the voltage 
waveform acquired by the proposed voltage sensor and the 
current waveform. The apparent power and PF obtained were 
transmitted using the wireless module (TWE-Lite, Mono 
Wireless Inc., Kanagawa, Japan).

Installation of the developed sensor is easy because 
noncontact single probes are used for both the current and 
voltage measurements. Furthermore, our sensor requires 
much less maintenance than conventional sensors because of 
its energy harvesting-based operation.

NON-METAL-CONTACT VOLTAGE MEASUREMENT 
USING PIEZOELECTRIC FILM
A voltage can be measured non-invasively using a single 
probe by measuring the electric field strength around a wire 
when the voltage is applied to the wire [11][12]. We have 
focused on use of a piezoelectric film to provide a low-cost 
method to measure electric fields. The piezoelectric film 
comprises a piezoelectric material sandwiched between metal

electrodes. The piezoelectric material is polarized by the 
electric field around the wire, and a potential difference is then 
generated between the two electrodes. The electric field 
around the wire can thus be detected using a single 
piezoelectric probe.
Figure 2. Results of noncontact voltage measurements 
using the piezoelectric film
A commercially-available piezoelectric film (LDT0-028K, 
TE Connectivity, Schaffhausen, Switzerland) was bent and 
was placed at a uniform distance from the center of the wire. 
The observed voltage waveform is shown in Figure 2. 
Although the output voltage and phase varied depending on 
the distance between the piezoelectric film and the wire, the 
correlation coefficient obtained for the actual and measured 
waveforms was 0.99. The proposed method can measure the 
relative change in the voltage, which is sufficient to enable 
calculation of the PF. The piezoelectric sensor output was 
related in advance to the actual voltage and was consistent 
with the calculation results from the equivalent circuit.
IV.
POWER FACTOR MEASUREMENT CIRCUIT
The developed sensor was operated using the power 
obtained from the current transformer; it is thus necessary to 
measure the PF with low power consumption. In this research, 
we used an analog circuit to perform PF measurements with 
low power consumption.
Figure 3. Block diagram of PF measurement circuit.
Figure 3 shows the block diagram of the fabricated PF 
measurement circuit. The current and voltage waveforms are 
converted into square waves, and the phase difference is then 
obtained as the pulse width by taking the logical product of 
these waves. Subsequently, the phase difference is output as 
an analog voltage through power amplification, smoothing, 
and differential amplification processes. The output is 
connected to the analog-to-digital converter of the wireless 
module and the data are transmitted. This circuit can be 
applied to both single- and three-phase electrical loads.
V.
FABRICATION AND FIELD TEST
The noncontact wireless apparent power and PF sensor was 
fabricated as shown in Figure 4. The fabricated sensor was 
then attached to an injection molding machine (SH100C, 
Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Tokyo, Japan) for field testing.

(b) Appearance of the fabricated sensor board.
Figure 5. Comparison of the PFs obtained from a commercially available 
logger and the fabricated sensor.
Figure 6. Comparison of the apparent power results obtained from a 
commercially available logger and the fabricated sensor.
Figures 5 and 6 show comparisons of the PFs and the 
apparent power values, respectively, that were measured using 
the developed sensor with those measured using a 
commercially-available power logger (CM3286-01, HIOKI 
E.E., Tokyo, Japan). The PF obtained by the developed sensor 
has a correlation coefficient of 0.80 with that measured using 
the commercial logger. The apparent power showed a 
correlation coefficient of 0.73. These results indicate that our 
sensor was able to measure the power consumption 
sufficiently accurately. The accuracy is suitable for rough 
logging of the PF and could be improved by calibration and 
grounding processes.
VI.
CONCLUSION
Voltage waveforms have been measured using a single 
piezoelectric probe without metal contacts. An energy-
harvesting wireless apparent power and PF sensor was 
prototyped using this piezoelectric probe. The data acquired 
using the developed sensor showed good agreement with the 
data acquired using a commercially-available power meter.
