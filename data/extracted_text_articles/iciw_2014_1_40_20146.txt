Abstract—This paper presents an investigation of teachers’ 
engagement and collaboration toward building a Teacher 
Community in the context of a blended post-graduate course 
about e-learning and ICT in education. The design of both 
pedagogical and technological dimensions of the teacher 
community framework are presented. Research data were 
analysed using Social Network Analysis methods and revealed 
important information regarding critical indicators of 
interaction and collaboration among participants and the whole 
community performance. Conclusions are drawn for future 
development and research about on-line teacher communities.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Virtual learning communities are generally thought as 
social structures that provide enhanced opportunities to 
communicate and collaborate with peers sharing the same 
interests, and to continually support learning and professional 
development of the participants [1][2][3][4]. An efficient 
community requires a set of rules, habits, strong ties and 
interaction between members to be established in order to 
achieve common goals [5]. In the last decade, the idea of 
Teacher Communities (TC) has received a growing interest 
among academics, policy makers and educators as an 
alternative to both isolated manner of work and the traditional 
teacher professional development approaches [6][7][8].  
In the context of situated learning, many scholars have 
come to emphasize learning in professional communities as a 
dynamic and social participation process, captured in 
collaborative activities, working artifacts, routines, stories or 
perceptions [1][9][10]. The main idea is to support teachers’ 
learning and collaboration, and strengthen their professional 
work by a) sharing common interests, experiences, 
educational resources and material, b) developing meaning 
and constructing new knowledge in a participatory and 
collaborative way, and c) enhancing their ability to put 
innovative instructional approaches into practice [11]. 
The widespread interest about on-line TC is rooted in their 
potential to create unique conditions for informal learning and 
a sustainable environment for teacher interaction and 
collaborative learning. There is growing research evidence 
supporting the impact of communities on teachers’ 
professional development as well as on student achievements 
[7][11][12][13]. TC are also claimed to contribute to the 
improvement of teaching and schooling practices [7][11][12] 
while they are considered as a way to embed teacher 
collaboration into the school culture [13]. In addition, on-line 
TC constitute a promising idea and a new model for teacher 
professional development [8][14][15]. The rapid growth and 
diffusion of Web 2.0 tools has led to increased interest in 
creating dynamic on-line TCs due to their affordances to 
support, without temporal or spatial restrictions, sustainable 
participatory environments for communication, interaction, 
content sharing, collaboration, self-directed and collaborative 
learning, peer- and self-assessment [7][8][15][16]. 
Many ideas have been proposed to describe decentralized, 
on-line learning communities where members work together 
and support each other, use a variety of tools and resources, 
and endeavour to achieve their learning goals through 
collaboration and problem solving activities [17][18]. Since 
each member offers his knowledge, experience, abilities and 
creations to the whole community, he/she can contribute 
decisively to the establishment of collective thinking and 
sharing knowledge among participants [10]. 
The design, implementation and evaluation of on-line TCs 
are still an open research problem in both teacher development 
and e-learning contexts [1][7][11][16][19]. This paper reports 
on 
the 
investigation 
of 
teachers’ 
engagement 
and 
collaboration toward building a structured TC, designed and 
implemented in the context of a blended post-graduate course 
about e-learning and ICT in education. The contribution of 
this study is, therefore, two-fold: a) to extend previous 
research findings concerning TCs in formal learning contexts 
by using an authentic learning design framework [20] driven 
by the ideas of social learning [5][10], and b) to apply a 
combined analysis of teachers’ learning-community activities 
using Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods, in order to 
shed light into the different ways of individual contributions, 
the dynamics of social interaction, and member ties appeared 
within the community. 
The paper is structured as following. The design 
framework of the TC and its pedagogical and technological 
dimensions are outlined. Teacher learning activities and the 
community workflow are presented in detail. Preliminary 
SNA findings regarding teachers’ participation, interaction 
and collaboration, as well as the community structure are 
presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn for future 
development and research in the area of on-line TCs.

II. 
TEACHER COMMUNITY  DESIGN FRAMEWORK 
According to Wenger [5], there are three core dimensions 
in a TC, which reflect the nature of the community, what it is 
about and how it functions: 
• Group identity: Mutual engagement that bind 
teachers together in a social entity. 
• Shared domain: A joint enterprise as understood and 
continually negotiated by community members. 
• Shared interactional repertoire: Shared practices, 
communal resources and beliefs that teachers have 
developed over time. 
Literature review suggests that asynchronous discussion 
forums and traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) 
were widely used to support on-line TC [2][3[[21]. However, 
LMS are tutor-centred environments, designed to support e-
learning in the context of formal education; they offer limited 
opportunities for learner-directed initiatives and actions. A TC 
platform should incorporate features and tools beyond 
conventional LMS.  
Towards outlining a conceptual and pedagogical 
framework of community interactions and collaborative 
learning, we have defined four constitutional components in 
relation to the dimensions of a TC [22]: 
Content sharing area: It includes various content sharing 
tools (file repository, blog, wiki, tagging, Web links, etc.). 
Communication area: This component is structured 
around various communication tools (messaging, chat, 
discussion forum, videoconference, microblogging). 
Community area: Community pages, group supporting, 
e-portfolio, task schedule and content management are the 
main tools of this component. 
Personal and supportive tools: Personal repository, 
dashboard, timeline, profile and searching tools. 
However, there are tools that could be assigned into more 
than one conceptual category. For example, wiki acts as both, 
content sharing and communication tool. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Architecture and components of TC platform. 
Using the conceptual framework above, the TC platform 
was designed to provide in an integrated way a variety of 
constructive, collaborative and community tools [22]. Figure 
1 presents the architecture of the TC platform and its 
components. The main site supported by Joomla offers a 
single-sing-on access to the community platform. The 
Learning Management System (Moodle) operates as both, the 
instructional/tutor area and the community dashboard, 
offering information about current news and events, forum 
topics, blog articles, group members, recent activities, etc. 
Linking to the other components of the platform, e.g., the e-
portfolio system (Mahara), the wiki system (Mediawiki), 
videoconference (BigBlueButton), is also available through 
Moodle. OpenWebQuest (http://openwebquest.org) is an 
additive tool developed in this project with the aim to support 
teachers to create and publish their own WebQuest-scenarios, 
and share them with peers in the community. 
III. 
THE STUDY 
A. Research questions 
In accordance with the research objectives and consistent 
with the related literature, the following research questions 
were addressed in this study: 
• What type of teacher activities were effective and 
facilitated learning presence within the community? 
To what extent did teachers participate and contribute 
to the community learning activities?  
• What were teachers’ patterns of presence and social 
interaction within the TC? What were the main 
features of the structure and the dynamics of the TC?  
B. Participants and context 
The community ran during spring semester of 2013, in the 
context of a masters’ degree course entitled “e-learning and 
ICT in education”, at the Department of Social and 
Educational Policy, University of Peloponnese, in Greece. 
Twenty three students (20 of them were in-service primary 
and secondary education teachers) attended this course. The 
teachers in the sample, though familiar with ICTs and the 
Web, had no previous experience with on-line collaborative 
tools and e-learning platforms; they had never before 
participated in learning communities.  
C. Community activities and workflow 
Our educational intervention followed the philosophy of 
structured community of learning [11][14] and the CIMO-
logic design model [23] by treating in an integrated manner 
the four community components: Context, Intervention, 
Mechanism and Outcomes. Using a blended format, it 
included five (5) face-to-face sessions in the classroom 
combined with on-line collaborative work, between January 
and June 2013. Following the pilot study [22], we shaped an 
ongoing cooperation framework with the aim to support a high 
level of dialogue, interaction, and collaboration among 
members. The instructor (T) was acting as the e-moderator by 
setting the context, the expectations and the processes of the 
community-based 
learning. 
Guidelines 
and 
technical 
assistance were also given by the course assistant. 
Teachers were asked to work both individually and 
collaboratively. They were free and encouraged to contribute 
by reflecting on themes presented in both face-to-face and on-
line sessions, starting new discussion topics, debating and 
interchanging ideas, sharing experiences, writing articles in 
the community blog, commentating peer contributions, 
uploading content material, suggesting information/content

resources, creating specific interest groups, undertaking roles 
and 
responsibilities 
within 
their 
group, 
designing 
collaboratively educational scenarios applicable in school 
practice, etc. However, each student-teacher was requested a) 
to write on the journal-blog area, at least, one article per month 
(5 in total) and b) to create and publish a WebQuest scenario 
using the OpenWebQuest platform. They were also asked to 
collaboratively create new educational artefacts (articles and 
documents, learning scenarios and educational material). To 
achieve this goal, they were encouraged to use e-portfolio 
(Mahara) 
and 
wiki 
(Mediawiki) 
subsystems 
for 
communication, ideas sharing and negotiation, co-authoring 
and co-creating.  
During this period, the participants were exposed into 
detailed on-line discussions regarding various issues arising 
into the community. Teachers’ individual and collaborative 
work was visible within the platform. In addition, participants 
were continually informed about any community event by 
receiving e-mail notifications through the platform. 
D. Sourse data and analysis  
Each member contribution was considered as the analysis 
unit. We used, therefore, three main sources of data: 
• 
Postings to various topics in the discussion forums 
• 
Publications on e-portfolio subsystem (articles/pages 
authoring, commentaries on peer articles, educational 
scenarios proposed etc.) 
• 
Contributions to the collaborative authoring of 
educational scenarios and to the related discussion 
topics on wiki-pages (Mediawiki subsystem). 
The analysis of students’ engagement, learning presence, 
and individual position within both, teacher groups and the 
whole community, was implemented by using SNA methods 
through NetMiner 4.0 (http://www.netminer.com). SNA has 
been effectively applied to analyze network operation (e.g., 
interactions among members, communication, information 
exchange, knowledge sharing, etc.) and community structure 
in various e-learning situations [24][25][26]. It provides a set 
of algorithms to quantify and give insight into member 
relations and group dynamics in terms of network structure 
parameters, e.g., cohesion, power centrality and betweeness 
centrality. In addition, SNA provides multiple graphs which 
represent the relations-interconnections among members, 
individual contributions as well as the structure-operation of 
the whole community.  
IV. 
RESULTS 
A. Descriptive analysis of teachers’ contributions 
Table I depicts an overall picture of teachers’ engagement 
and the main community activities/contributions recorded for 
each member: a) teacher working groups they participated in, 
b) individual articles published in the journal area, c) article 
commentaries received by community members, d) article 
views by the other community members, and e) posts they 
uploaded in the community forum.  
It is quite clear that the majority of the participants were 
active community members. A total of 14 working groups 
were created during the community timeline. They were not 
addressed by the tutor who created just one group. Rather they 
appeared as the outcome of teachers’ interests and their 
spontaneous initiatives to collaboratively work with peers in 
order a) to study a new educational topic and b) to design new 
educational scenarios. Teachers S15 and S22 created three 
groups, S23 initiated two groups, and members S6, S14, S17, 
S19, S20 and S22 created one group each. Within working 
groups, 14 pages were recorded and 6 complete learning 
scenarios were collaboratively created in the wiki system. In 
addition, 21 WebQuests were individually constructed and 
were available to the community members for commenting 
and peer reviewing. To organize and support their work and 
collaboration the teachers uploaded, in total, 206 forum 
postings. 
A total of 135 original articles were published in the e-
portfolio area which were dealing with both, theoretical and 
practical themes; they were related to various educational 
topics (e.g., contemporary pedagogy and ICT, learning design 
and scenarios, educational practices with ICT, e-learning, 
Web 2.0 tools in practice etc.). Comprehensive discussions 
were evolved around the topics above; 647 article 
commentaries were uploaded. The number of views per article 
is also an indicator of teachers’ social interactions through 
sharing their ideas, beliefs and creations.

mechanism (Astrolabe) which was collaboratively created.

ideas and suggestions regarding the expected learning 
outcomes of this scenario are presented at the bottom. 
B. Social Network Analysis 
Individual 
contribution, 
member 
relations, 
group 
dynamics and community operation were analyzed in terms of 
three network structure parameters, namely cohesion, power 
centrality and betweeness centrality. Cohesion analysis aims 
at revealing the architecture of the TC, e.g., the existence of 
cliques (subgroups) of community members who were 
connected internally more than externally. If the cohesion 
index in a sub-group is greater than 1 then the links within the 
clique are stronger on average than the links with the members 
outside [26]. A total of 58 cliques revealed in the community.  
The e-portfolio sub-system was adopted by the teachers as the 
main area around which their community activities were 
evolved; 49 cliques were recorded there. In addition, 4 cliques 
were in Mediawiki, and 5 in the Moodle forum topics.  
It is important to be pointed here that the majority of the 
Mahara cliques (46 of them) included a great number of 
members, ranging from 7 to 12. This indicates that the 
community subgroups were very cohesive. In other words, TC 
members tended to develop strong interrelations and a wide 
scope of interaction offering enhanced opportunities for 
collaborative knowledge construction and knowledge sharing 
among teachers. 
Power (or centrality) analysis is an effective SNA method 
to measure network activity, to reveal the operation of the 
community network and to assess the impact each member 
had with respect to spreading information and influencing 
others in the community [26][27]. In-degree centrality 
represents the number of interactions a teacher receives from 
other members in the community. Accordingly, out-degree 
centrality is the number of connections a teacher has to the 
other members. Betweensess centrality represents the capacity 
of a teacher to act as a connector between other members, e.g., 
it is an indicator of individual position within the community.

Table II shows the results of the network activity measures 
and presents the power distribution among members in the 
community. The great majority of the teachers were active 
community members since they have interacted, at least, with 
50% of their peers. Teachers S10 and S15 were the most 
influential members, since they received a great number of 
connections (posts) from their peers (79.17%). Teachers S3, 
S7 and S13 were the most effective and successful members 
in the community towards triggering other teachers (they were 
connected with 83.33% of the participants). On the other hand, 
S9 and S11 had a marginal community contribution, since 
they influenced only one member (4.17%).  
Figure 4 shows the power centrality map of teachers’ 
activities, which includes member connections through the 
main systems of the community platform (LMS, e-portfolio, 
wiki). It is a measure of the influence each participant had in 
the community. A large group of teachers were placed near 
the center of the map (e.g., S3, S10, S22, S15, S4, S6, S7, S8, 
S17, S19, and S23). They were the most active, influential and 
powerful members in the community and they had many ties 
and connections to other powerful participants. On the other 
hand, as moving to the periphery, teachers were less powerful 
and important community members, e.g., S9 and S11 had a 
marginal community contribution. 
Figure 5 presents the betweeness (intermediation) 
centrality map. Teacher S15, who placed at the center, was the 
most effective member to connect others and, consequently, 
he had more control of the interaction and information 
interchange within the community. Teachers S22, S3, S10, 
S23, S14, S4, and S7 were also good connectors compared to 
their peers in the periphery. As an overall view, this was a very 
cohesive community; the majority of the participants had 
significant contribution while there is only one member (S11) 
with marginal engagement.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper reported on an investigation concerning a TC, 
designed to support blended and collaborative learning, in the 
context of a post-graduate course. The research findings of 
SNA provided supportive evidence that the structured 
community framework presented here was effective and 
offered valuable source data for the investigation of teachers’ 
engagement and learning actions occurring within a TC.  
The results revealed important information about the 
structure and the cohesion of the community, the teacher 
groups 
developed 
therein, 
teacher 
connections 
and 
information flow, as well as the power and the influence each 
participant had within the community. The majority of the 
participants demonstrated enhanced interest and they were 
actively engaged into the community activities (uploading 
articles and postings, supporting dialogue and discussion 
topics, interchanging ideas, sharing content and resources, co-
creating educational material, etc.). 
The outcome of this non-formal e-learning program was a 
promising evidence of a decentralized teacher community. 
SNA revealed that the tutor was not the central member of the 
learning community network. On the other hand, teachers’ 
engagement and interaction patterns were strong indicators of 
a) enhanced learner control and motivation to keep learning 
activities evolving, and b) supporting collaboration and 
building a community of learning among participants. 
This investigation contributes to the existing knowledge 
and could guide both, future research in this area as well the 
design and the implementation of efficient on-line TC [6][14]. 
Our current efforts are directed towards combining SNA 
findings with qualitative data from content analysis of 
teachers’ on-line discourse and teachers’ interviews to further

analyze their engagement, learning presence and knowledge 
construction within the community. In addition, a comparative 
analysis of data extracted from an open, non-structured TC is 
under completion.
