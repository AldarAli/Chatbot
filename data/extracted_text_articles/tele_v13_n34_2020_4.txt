Abstract—Nonverbal communication plays an important role in 
social interaction. Mirroring, an action that mimics the 
nonverbal behavior patterns of their interaction partners, 
captures the attention of the Human-Computer Interaction 
(HCI) community. This action can help building rapport with 
others by making communication more effective and reflective. 
This study proposes a computer vision-based system that detects 
mirroring and analyzes the time lag during a face-to-face 
communication. Our approach consists of the following steps: 
(1) human pose estimation; (2) hand gestures quantization; (3) 
action detection based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW); (4) 
estimation of mirroring time lag based on the cross-correlation. 
For this study, we recorded twenty face-to-face communication 
scenes using an omni-directional video camera with and without 
mirroring performed by the imitator. Results show that the 
DTW was able to detect actions having distinct gestures, 
whereas the cross-correlation was able to estimate the time lags 
for reactive mimicry of the imitator during the conversation. 
Keywords- mirroring communication; nonverbal communication; 
human pose estimation; DTW; cross-correlation. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
To improve communication skill, it is important to pay 
attention to eye contact, gestures, postures, body movements, 
and voice tones. These nonverbal actions can provide clues, 
additional information, and meaning in addition to verbal 
communication. Moreover, using these actions that reflect the 
behavior of the talking partner can help to create a strong 
connection with both side during the conversation. These 
techniques are called nonverbal mirroring. This study extends 
our previous research on analysis of communication mirroring 
using vision cameras [1]. Nonverbal mirroring during face-to-
face communication can be used to show empathy and 
positive reaction to counterparts. Nonverbal behavioral 
mimicry can occur with little or no awareness but can occur 
during more than 30% of a given interaction [2]. More 
specifically, nonverbal mirroring can be distinguished from 
imitation behavior, which is an event in which two people act 
the same regardless of timing, and complementary behavior, 
which is an event in which two people act differently [3].  In 
this paper, we limited the scope of nonverbal mirroring to 
imitation behavior. The results of this study will complement 
studies on mirroring facial expressions in the generation of 
rapport scales. 
The areas of the human brain that are activated by 
observation and execution of the same actions are called the 
“mirror neuron system.” Functional Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (fMRI) of frontal and parietal regions of the brain 
indicated that these regions are most consistently involved 
during mirroring [4]. For actions that are considered mirroring, 
each action taken by a partner are reciprocated by the 
coordinated manner with time lags. Studies have been 
conducted to define the time lag before mirroring occurs. Hale 
et al. (2020) suggested that 400-1,000ms is a plausible time 
range for reactive mirroring in a natural conversation [3]. 
However, mirroring might happen on a longer timescale, 2-
10s [5] or 7s [6] at most. 
Traditionally, measuring nonverbal mirroring had to be 
done manually by annotating of characteristic gestures of the 
subject and similar gestures of the counterpart from recorded 
videos of face-to-face communication. The resulting 
repetitive behavior, its duration, and response latency are 
quantized and used for further analysis, such as rapport-based 
behavior analysis [7]. BECO2, an integrated behavioral 
coding system, is widely used in Japanese universities to train 
students about behavior coding [8]. The system allows 
observers to record and analyze the occurrence and duration 
of actions by pressing the keyboard keys corresponding to 
each category. Because there is a lot of ambiguity in 
judgments of specific actions, observers tend to make 
inconsistent judgments, which reduces the quality of 
measurements. 
The analysis of nonverbal mirroring has been studied for 
some time, but little research has been done on how to 
automate the analysis as an alternative to manual coding. To 
date, there is no practical software application program that 
can automatically detect mirroring from a video of face-to-
face communication and calculate the time difference until the 
mirroring occurs. Speech and video processing technologies 
may contribute to the efficient analysis of conversational 
scenes. On the one hand, speech processing can reveal 
nonverbal behaviors such as speech, stress acts, and speech 
rate based on speech signals [9], but on the other hand, video 
processing can measure facial information and gestures [10]. 
Since mirroring is a complex phenomenon [11], we made 
a first attempt to build a framework which quantify gestures 
from a video of face-to-face communication in order to 
automatically detect the presence of mirroring [1]. In this 
paper, we further enhance the framework by improving

gesture detection and adding the ability to estimate the overall 
time lag of the detected mirroring. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents related research on behavioral coding and gesture 
analysis using computer vision techniques. Section III 
introduces the proposed framework for analyzing the presence 
of communication mirroring. Section IV describes the results.

RELATED WORK
The development of automatic mirroring detection 
involves building the mimicry dataset. MAHNOB is a public 
mimicry dataset consisting of a collection of multisensory 
audiovisual recordings of fully synchronized naturalistic 
dyadic interactions. The recordings were made under 
controlled laboratory conditions using 15 cameras and three 
microphones to obtain the most favorable conditions possible 
for analyzing the observed behavior [12]. Bilakhia et al. 
(2015) 
applied 
classifiers
such 
as 
cross-correlation, 
generalized time warping, and Long Short-Term Memory 
Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) to face and head 
movement data in the MAHNOB dataset [13]. However, the 
mirroring detection performance of these classifiers was poor, 
suggesting that more advanced learning methods are needed 
to deal with the variability in the dataset.
Some studies have attempted to detect mirroring using 
special cameras. Terven et al. (2015) introduced mirroring 
detection based on head-gestures using computer vision-based 
wearable devices [14]. A camera embedded in the wearable 
device was used to detect facial features of the partner during 
a face-to-face communication. Hidden Markov Models 
(HMMs) was used to recognize similar head-gestures. 
However, the mirroring detection performance was affected 
by the amount of head-gestures that occur in each data case.
Jaana et al. (2014) developed an automated behavioral
analysis system using a single omnidirectional camera. This 
system analyzed facial expressions, head nods, utterances 
based on facial features extracted from the camera [10]. While 
the system is not specifically designed to detect mirroring, it 
opens a way to simplify the video recording process during 
face-to-face communication by using an omnidirectional 
camera to analyze all participants in a conversation.
Body movements can be automatically accessed using 
computer vision-based methods, such as Motion Energy 
Analysis (MEA) [15] and OpenPose [16]. MEA measures 
motion by counting color changes in successive frames within 
a predefined region of interest, whereas OpenPose measures 
key points on the human body, hands, face and feet. 
Schoenherr et al. (2019) evaluated the performance of various 
time series analysis methods on nonverbal synchronous data 
quantified by MEA [17]. Schneider et al. (2019) proposed a 
gesture recognition system [18] using human posture obtained 
from a single camera using OpenPose. This system combined 
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and One-Nearest-Neighbor 
classifier to classify the time series data.

III. ANALYSIS OF NONVERBAL MIRRORING COMMUNICATION
We propose a method to automatically analyze nonverbal 
mirroring communication from the recorded movements of 
pairs of participants (dyads): a subject and an experimenter.
Our method uses DTW to detect and classify characteristic 
movements and uses cross-correlation to estimate the overall 
time lag of mirroring movements during a conversation. Here, 
we chose to focus on hand-gesture data only, based on a pilot 
study that revealed stronger similarities between the dyads 
than whole-body posture data.
A. Participants
46 students (25 males and 21 females) who have had part-
time work experience in multiple faculties at Iwate Prefectural 
University were interviewed for approximately 5 minutes. 
The experimenter was a student in the same grade as the 
subjects and had been fully trained in behavioral mirroring. 
Subjects, who were not normally close to the experimenter, 
were recruited through the snowball sampling method.

During the interview, the subjects were asked about their 
work experience. The experimenter intentionally mirrored 25 
subjects (14 males and 11 females) and did not mirror the 
remaining 21 subjects (11 males and 10 females). Hereinafter, 
we refer to the former as Group A and the latter as Group B. 
This division was done randomly. Six subjects who did not 
perform the hand gestures were excluded from the analysis. 
Finally, a total of 40 conversations, 20 in group A (10 males 
and 10 females) and 20 in group B (11 males and 9 females), 
were included in the analysis.
B. Laboratory Setup
Two chairs were set up in the room facing each other for 
the subjects and the experimenter, as shown in Figure 1. To 
simplify the video recording process, an omnidirectional 
camera (Ricoh Theta S) [19] was placed between the 
experimenter and the subject, and video recording was 
performed at 30 Hz. Subjects were seated after completing the 
informed consent form. Subjects and experimenters were 
given a clipboard to take the necessary notes on. The 
interviews were conducted while holding this clipboard. This 
clipboard restricted the subject's hand gestures and allowed us 
to efficiently extract only those gestures that are important for 
communication mirroring. The subject was expected to 
generate hand gestures with one hand while holding the 
clipboard in the other hand, or to generate hand gestures with 
both hands by placing the clipboard on his or her lap.
C. Pre-processing
1) Panoramic Image Projection
Ricoh Theta S generates two fisheye images to represent 
a 360° image. We merged and warped these images to 
produce a panoramic image, as shown in Figure 2, which 
allows the experimenter and the subject in the image to be 
seen from the front. The panoramic image is presented as a 
rectangular image of a 360° image. No special effort was 
made to produce this image. Everything was done using the 
built-in Ricoh utility program.
2) Quantitation of Hand Gestures
OpenPose with the 18-keypoint Coco body model was 
used to estimate the body posture of the dyads. For the purpose 
of this paper, only the positional information of the wrist joint 
is extracted from the body posture. The pixel coordinates of 
each joint were calculated from the panoramic images and 
these coordinates were normalized with the neck joint as the 
Figure 4. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) created to facilitate the selection and visualization of the training dataset in this study.

origin. We quantified the wrist data as follows. Let 
𝑊௡(𝑥௟, 𝑦௟, 𝑥௥, 𝑦௥) represents coordinates of both wrists at nth 
frame, wrist data at this frame is calculated by 
𝑊𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑡௡ = ‖𝑊௡‖ଶ = ට𝑥௟
ଶ + 𝑦௟
ଶ + 𝑥௥ଶ + 𝑦௥ଶ  . 
 
(1) 
Equation (1) reduces the dimensionality of the data at both 
wrists, but our preliminary results show that this data 
transformation can eliminate ambiguous gestures that do not 
correspond to mirroring. 
In this study, we use wrist time series data to represent 
the gesture. Figure 3 shows an example of wrist data for 
Group A and B, measured in this study.  These figures show 
that the variability of the dyads' wrist data was similar in 
Group A, but not in Group B. Here, we did not limit the 
duration of the interviews, which resulted in different frame 
lengths of the wrist data measured in each interview. 
3) Building Training Dataset for DTW 
Given that natural mirroring does not require a faithful 
reproduction of the opponent's hand gestures, we defined two 
classes of hand gestures based on their movement 
characteristics. We considered that highly variable gestures 
are subject to mirroring and less variable gestures are not. 
Hereinafter, we refer to them as class 1 and class 2, 
respectively.  
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was created to facilitate 
the selection and visualization of wrist data ranges for 
building training dataset, as shown in Figure 4. The slider can 
be used to determine the onset and offset of each gesture. In 
addition, when the slider is moved, the frame and the posture 
of both persons corresponding to the slider are displayed in 
real time. Training data individually selected from subjects 
and experimenters are drawn in a timeline. The vertical lines 
connecting the subject and the experimenter indicates that the 
subject's gestures are mirrored.  
One of the most difficult aspects of creating a training 
dataset is to define the number of classes of gestures in the 
dataset. After reviewing all recorded videos, none of the 
subjects generated two-handed gestures with the clipboard on 
their lap. When generating a gesture, the subject always holds 
the clipboard with one hand. Interestingly, when the gesture 
was not generated, the subject continued to hold the clipboard 
with both hands. Based on these observations, we classified 
the subjects' gestures into two classes. 
Figure 5 shows the wrist data, describing the class 1 and 
class 2 hand gestures created from the dyads, respectively. 
Each class contains three time series data. In class 1, the

moment the hand leaves the clipboard was determined to be 
onset, and the moment the hand returns to the clipboard is to 
be offset. On the other hand, in the class 2, the onset and offset 
were determined when the clipboard is held in both hands for 
a period. 
The gestures of the experimenter are relatively shorter 
than those of the subjects. This can be interpreted as a result 
of the experimenter confirming the subject's gesture and then 
simply imitating the gesture.  
4) Detection 
We performed DTW using the Gesture Recognition 
Toolkit (GRT) of Gillian and Paradiso (2012) [20] and 
applied maximum likelihood from the warping distance to 
estimate similarity to the training data. Table I shows the 
likelihood between gestures of the dyads shown in Figure 5. 
This data was normalized before it was inputted into the GRT. 
The DTW was able to correctly match the same gesture 
between the dyads, even though the length of the subject's 
gesture is different from the length of the experimenter's 
gesture. Although more gesture training data would be 
desirable, this study focuses on a basic analysis of the extent 
to which the simplest gestures can be used to detect what 
appears to be mirroring. 
In this study, we used the average length of the training 
data frame as the maximum warp amount during the 
calculation of DTW. We considered that this DTW’s window 
width is sufficient for our purpose.  
5) Cross-correlation 
Cross-correlation is useful for aligning two time series, 
one of which is lagged relative to the other, since its peak 
occurs at the lag where the two time series are most correlated. 
Cross-correlation 𝜌 at delay 𝑑 between the subject’s and the 
examiner’s hand gestures is define as 
𝜌(𝑑) = 
∑
{(௫೔ି௫̅)(௬೔ష೏ି௬ത)}
ಿ
೔సభ
ට∑
(௫೔ି௫̅)మ ∑
(௬೔ష೏ି௬ത)మ
ಿ
೔సభ
ಿ
೔సభ
 
 
(2) 
Here,  𝑥௜  and 𝑦௜ିௗ  are series of the subject’s and the 
examiner’s hand gestures, respectively. 𝑥̅  and 𝑦ത represents 
means of  𝑥௜ and 𝑦௜ିௗ. 
Following [3] and [5], we assume that the mirroring occurs 
at around 0.4-7s.  In other words, if a time lag longer than 7s 
is calculated, it means that no mirroring has occurred in the 
data. From this perspective, cross-correlation can be the 
easiest way to determine the presence or absence of mirroring.

RESULTS
A. Mirroring Analysis
For automatic detection of two classes, we used only 
training data collected from subjects, as shown in Figure 5(a). 
The experimenter's gestures described in the previous section 
were only for validating the subject's gestures. The behaviors 
of subjects and experimenters corresponding to each class 
were collected and presented in a time series of the input data.
Cross-correlations were calculated for the subject's and 
experimenter's wrist data. Here, we normalized the values of 
the cross-correlation to take values from -1 to +1. The 
maximum value of the cross-correlation function indicates the 
point in time where the data are most aligned (delay time).
Figure 6 shows the results of the detection and cross-
correlation of the two classes in the two interview scenes. The 
top of the figure shows the raw data of the dyads’ wrist
movements. The experimenter's data were then shifted based 
on the time lag between dyads as measured by cross-
correlation. To make the shifted data easier to observe, the 
shifted data was moved upward. The gray arrows indicate 
some of the areas where the subject's wrist data and the shifted 
experimenter's wrist data are similar. The bottom row of the 
figure shows two classes of detection from the dyads’ wrist

data. Red points represent class 1 detections for the subject, 
whereas blue points for the experimenter. Given that these 
detected gestures have similar features, it is likely that these 
blue dots mirror the red dots. As can be seen from the figure, 
the number of class 1 detections of the subjects was higher 
than that of the experimenters. It is a reasonable result since 
the incidence of the mirrored gestures should not exceed the 
mirrored target. It should also be noted that the class 1 
behaviors detected from the experimenter occurred after the 
same class of behaviors detected from the subjects. Green dots 
represent class 2 detections of the dyads. Gestures that could 
not be classified as class 1 were classified as class 2, resulting 
in a higher frequency of class 2 detections. In this mirroring 
analysis, we did not target class 2, which has few variable 
gestures, so we integrated the resulting detections of class 2 of 
the dyads, as shown in Figure 6.
Table II shows results of cross-correlation analysis for 20 
mirrored conversations in this study. In the first 15 
conversations, we found that the experimenter's wrist data are 
delayed between 0.7-4.9s than the subject's wrist data. 
However, the remaining five conversations measured a time 
lag that did not meet the mirroring condition (numbers in 
italic). These are partly due to the inability of the experimenter 
to mirror the subject properly during conversations, but also 
due to the increased variation in behavior, such as having a 
drink during a conversation. Figure 7 shows that the 
measurement delay of conversation #16 can be corrected from 
481 frames (16s) to 70 frames (2.3s) by trimming a portion of 
the data.
Table III shows results of cross-correlation analysis for 20 
non-mirrored conversations in this study. In the first 17 
conversations, the measured time lag showed that no 
mirroring occurred during the conversation. However, the 
time lag in the remaining three conversation scenes suggests 
that mirroring behavior occurred (numbers in italic). Figure 8 
shows that similar patterns between the dyads in conversation 
#18 and #19. This implies that the experimenter may 
unconsciously engage in mirroring behavior.
B. Perceived Empathy
Perceived empathy was measured using the 16-item
empathy understanding subscale of the Barrett-Lennard
Relationship Inventory (BLRI) [21]. All items in the 
perceived empathy assessment were scored on a six-point 
Likert scale, with 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = 
slightly disagree, 4 = slightly agree, 5 = agree, and 6 = strongly 
agree. Higher scores represented more empathy perceived by 
subjects. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha is 0.81, indicating high 
reliability.

To evaluate whether there was a difference in the mean 
score on the perceived empathy scale by gender and the 
presence of mirroring, we conducted a two-factor analysis of 
variance. The means and standard deviations are shown in 
Table IV. The results showed a significant main effect on the 
gender factor (F(1, 36) = 8.04, p < 0.5), but not on the presence 
of mirroring factor ( F(1, 36) = 0.72, n.s.). No significant 
interactions were observed (F(1, 36) = 0.01, n.s.). The present 
results indicate that female subjects were more emphatic with 
and without mirroring during the interview. To promote 
empathy by mirroring communication, a longer interview than 
the present experiment would be necessary. 
C. Debriefing 
Once the interview was completed, the experimenter 
provided the subject with accurate and pertinent information 
about the nature of this experiment. During the debriefing 
process, subjects are informed about what the hypothesis for 
the experiment was as well. 
After the debriefing, the 20 subjects who had been 
mirrored were asked if they noticed that they were being 
mirrored or if they felt that the conversation was unnatural. 
Six subjects said that they noticed that they were being 
mirrored. They were aware of being mirrored because they 
were already knowledgeable about mirroring. All 20 subjects 
did not find it unnatural to be mirrored. In this short interview, 
the recorded video shows that there is almost no pause in the 
conversation between the two parties, with the subject actively 
answering the experimenter's questions. This may explain 
why the subjects did not feel unnatural in their conversations. 
 
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Many studies have been done to automatically detect 
mirroring during conversations, but to the best of our 
knowledge, it has not reached a practical level [13][14][22]. 
In order to automatically detect mirroring behavior during 
conversations, we attempted to make the gestures on the dyads 
as simple as possible. Having the subjects hold the clipboard 
during the conversation was effective in limiting their hand 
gestures. This allowed the experimenter to properly imitate 
the subjects' gestures.

The DTW and cross-correlations used in this study are 
commonly used in time series data analysis. In general, a 
mimic gesture is one in which the performer tries to mimic the 
actions of the other person as accurately as possible. However, 
there is a difference between similar behaviors perceived by 
humans and similar behaviors seen from sensor information. 
For this reason, we successfully identified distinct gestures 
using DTW without being too obsessed with small 
movements by making the information of the hand gestures 
one-dimensional using the L2 norm. On the other hand, cross-
correlation analysis successfully estimated the time lag of 
mirroring behavior in conversations. Interestingly, cross-
correlation analysis was able to detect the unintended 
mirroring even if the experimenter did not intend to mirror the 
subject. 
Nonverbal mirroring communication helps to create a 
strong connection between the two parties during a 
conversation, but in the present experiment, subjects' empathy 
levels were not significant with or without mirroring 
communication. A longer interview than the present 
experiment would be necessary to promote empathy through 
mirrored communication. 
Finally, since the observed data contain a lot of noise, 
removing the noise can improve the accuracy of the analysis. 
The mirroring time lag can be properly determined by 
trimming a portion of the data, as in this study.
