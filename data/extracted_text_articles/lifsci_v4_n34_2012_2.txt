Abstract—The aim of the study was the investigation of the 
existing literature dealing with trust in Ambient Assisted 
Living (AAL). Additionally, a definition of trust in AAL was 
derived. For that purpose, a numeric analysis of articles 
considering the factor trust in automation, as well as assistive 
technologies for older people was carried out. A systematic 
literature review with a total of 150 dissimilar keyword-
combinations, based on three different descriptors in three 
bibliographic online databases, was performed. This review 
revealed that 18 articles deal with trust in healthcare or 
assistance systems, but several of them only superficially. 
Despite the increasing market relevance in the last decade, 
none of the identified studies focused explicitly on trust in 
AAL. As can be seen from the results, older people as a target 
group for qualitative and quantitative research in this field are 
detected, but only partially examined. For obtaining access to 
older persons’ trust in automation in general and AAL in 
particular, further research is needed. To identify influencing 
factors on trust in AAL, a broader survey and experiments 
with persons over the age of 60 years should be conducted.

 INTRODUCTION 
As a result of demographic change, the number of people 
in advanced age, who want to spend a self-determined, 
independent life at home, is growing. Unfortunately, not all 
elderly people are able to reach this goal without assistance. 
This often leads to conflicting goals. An age-related decline 
in physical fitness, as well as physical limitations in 
consequence of diseases or accidents, mean that the elderly 
need support in realizing their desire to live in their familiar 
surroundings. 
This 
results 
in 
tension 
between 
the 
affordability of traditional personal care and specific 
individual support, as well as novel technical support. As 
seen in [1] the concept of trust in Ambient Assisted Living 
(hereinafter AAL) should be ascribed greater importance.   
On one hand, human assistance in activities of daily living 
(ADL) like taking a bath, preparing meal or going for a walk 
is a great relief for people with health restrictions. On the 
other hand, science has, for several decades, dealt with 
research into new technologies to support people in their 
own home [2]. Meanwhile, innovations in the home 
environment offer numerous opportunities for technology-
supported systems. Researchers have developed a plurality 
of services combined with technical support for elderly 
people. Terms as ‘Smart House’ [3], ‘Smart Home’ [4], 
‘Assistive Technology (AT)’ [5] or ‘Ambient Assisted 
Living (AAL)’ [6] are just a few of the frequently used terms 
in this context.  
In the present article the importance of trust in AAL for 
elderly people is the focal point of interest. In order to take 
advantage of AAL technology, which assists an impaired 
person in everyday life [7], the user must have trust in this 
assistance system. Since, in case of an emergency, this 
assistance can save lives, it is obvious that the concept of 
trust has fundamental importance to the consideration of 
development, purchase and use of AAL. The fact that older 
people have typically grown up without technologies like 
personal computers, smart phones or the Internet, which are 
often integrated in AAL [8], implies special demands 
towards the design of these devices. 
The present study is structured as follows: Firstly, the 
background section explains the development of AAL as a 
result of demographic change. Next, the importance of trust 
as an influencing factor in this research context will be 
highlighted and a definition for trust in AAL derived. In the 
third section the literature review as research framework is 
described in detail. The acquired data is then analyzed in its 
entirety and moreover, studies regarding trust in healthcare 
and assistance systems are considered separately. Finally, a 
discussion of the observed results and an overview about 
further research activities is provided. The design of the 
present study is oriented to answer the research question: 
Why is the investigation of trust in AAL necessary, and what 
is the current state of research into it?

BACKGROUND 
This section contains the background information about 
the development of AAL as a reaction to demographic 
change, as well as the importance of the concept of trust as 
an influencing factor for AAL. In conclusion, the 
development of a definition of trust in AAL is detailed. 
A. Development of AAL as Reaction to the Demographic 
Change 
According to the United Nations Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), as compared to 
the total population, the proportion of people over the age of 
60 years is constantly increasing [9]. The number of people 
over the age of 60 is predicted to grow from more than 700 
million in 2009, to 2 billion in the year 2050. Worldwide this 
would correspond to a tripling of the cohort in a period of 40 
years. The annual growth rate of ‘generation 60plus’ 
amounts 2.6 percent. This increase eclipses the overall 
population’s growth rate of 1.2 percent per annum. At the 
present time, over a fifth of the population in the more 
developed regions is 60 years of age or over. Projections 
indicate that nearly one third of the total population will 
belong to that age group by 2050 [9]. Based on this 
development, health care expenditure, for example within the 
European Union and Norway, will change dramatically [10].  
Additionally, it should be mentioned that age is not 
readily defined in reference only to the date of birth. 
Although the chronological age of two persons could be 
equal, the biological, psychological or social age may differ 
[11]. Also the cohort effect may influence differences in 
persons’ age [12]. As defined by the World Health 
Organization “there is no United Nations standard numerical 
criterion, but the UN agreed cut-off is 60+ years to refer to 
the older population [11].”  The terminology ‘older person’ 
or ‘elderly person’ is used interchangeably; therefore, these 
terms are similarly used in the current study for people over 
the age of 60. The above presented facts, in combination 
with the existing older persons’ purchasing power, 
accentuate the enormous importance of the elderly for 
science and economy. 
Moreover, technological progress and a high degree of 
information technology are factors that are gaining more and 
more relevance in everyday life. The beginning of research 
into the field of Assistive Technology (AT) can be traced 
back to the early 1970’s. Then, so called “phone-chains” 
used the standard telephone system and were organized by a 
network of elderly-persons and professionals [2]. Mutual 
telephone calls were used to monitor the group, and if a 
member did not respond, their doctor or relatives were 
notified. This can be regarded as the first electronic 
emergency system for elderly persons.  
The next step was the development of home emergency 
call systems. One of the most famous was the HTS831, 
which had two different buttons: one red, and one green. 
This system consisted of a wireless transmitter, which the 
user was able to wear around their neck. In case of 
emergency the user could either push the button on the 
transmitter or the red button at the station, to contact the 
emergency center. As a security and monitoring function, the 
user had to press the green button once a day [2]. In the 
middle of the 1990’s, the first video conference system for 
private homes was offered. TV-top boxes, or a separate 
video 
telephone, 
functioned 
as 
the 
user 
interface. 
Additionally, this system contained functions for personal 
discussions and organization of, for example, nursing, 
medical or entertainment services [13]. In summary, efforts 
to develop useful and coherent life assistance services, which 
aid older persons to live longer in their home, have existed 
for several decades.  
In the last few years, due to awareness of the growing 
distribution of older people, and technological progress, the 
development of AAL has significantly increased in its 
importance. 
Many 
national 
and 
international 
Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and research projects 
have been focusing on this topic. As a result, different 
concepts have entered the market [8][14][15][16]. For 
instance, through the use of sensory floor mats - which 
register 
movements 
in 
living 
areas 
and 
react by 
automatically turning the lights on - the risk of falling can be 
reduced [17]. Another example of AAL can be found in the 
combination of personal and technological support offered 
by the Fraunhofer Institute [8]. By means of summarizing 
and 
demand-oriented 
analysis 
of 
sensor 
data, 
an 
individualization of care, as well as nursing services is 
possible. From a technological perspective it must be noted 
that most of the described systems are still in their early 
phase of innovation. Only a few AAL systems are currently 
marketable [18]. The German Federal Ministry of Education 
and Research (BMBF) launched the funding program “age-
appropriate assistance systems for a healthy and independent 
life – AAL”, which sponsored 18 research projects in the 
field of AAL with a total amount of € 45 million [19]. 
Giesecke et al. (2005) have first defined AAL “as the use 
of AmI [Ambient Intelligence] in everyday life. Assisted 
means assistance, by technical devices as well as by 
technical or human services [6].” In 2007, a more elaborate 
definition of AAL is found in [7]. Hereafter, AAL denotes 
“living in a smart technology supported environment that 
reacts sensitively and adaptively to the presence of people 
and objects and thus provides various services to the human. 
The aim is to preserve, enlarge and extend the personal 
freedom and autonomy, by promoting and supporting 
personal independence [7; translated by the authors].”   
Although AAL does not explicitly target the elderly and can 
be implemented in a huge variety of living situations for 
people with impairments, in practice most of the projects, 
which carry out research are concerned with the elderly [20]. 
The definition by Kung and Bart (2010) focuses particularly 
on enabling older people to experience of a higher quality of 
life. AAL refers to “intelligent systems that will assist elderly 
individuals for a better, healthier and safer life in the 
preferred living environment and covers concepts, products 
and services that interlink and improve new technologies and 
the social environment [21].”  
AAL cannot be seen as a single technology but as a 
network of interacting systems or agents, for instance 
companies from different areas of society. The aim of AAL 

79
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 4 no 3 & 4, year 2012, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/
2012, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
is to combine those various agents in one holistic system 
adapted to diverse customer needs. As seen in [18] four 
different scopes for application for AAL systems called 
“health and care”, “household and supply”, “security and 
privacy” and “communication and social environment” exist. 
Due to this diversity, AAL systems should integrate in a 
modular design and be flexible for the customer’s individual 
needs; lifestyle and health condition [22]. 
In terms of the German Association for Electrical, 
Electronic & Information Technologies, AAL is defined as 
follows: “Assistant systems for the constitution of intelligent 
environments [aiming] to compensate predominantly age-
related functional limitations of different target groups – 
through technological information and communication 
support in everyday life [23].” This definition emphasizes 
the role of information and communication technology in 
particular.  
In contrast to home automation [24] or the smart house 
[3], AAL is not limited to only life in relation to housing, but 
extends to all areas of life. AAL focuses on the assistance 
functions of an adaptive overall system while home 
automation deals mainly with automation and networking of 
devices. AAL focuses on maintaining, increasing and 
extending the user’s personal freedom and autonomy. In 
summary, AAL systems are intended for people with health 
impairments who require security in their environments and 
support in communication to prevent loneliness. The present 
European research focuses on these overall requirements of 
elderly persons. Since the concept of AAL is concerned with 
these holistic requirements, the importance of trust in AAL 
needs to be more understood for permanent usage. 
B. The Concept Trust as Influencing Factor for the Usage 
of AAL 
“There are multiple definitions of trust and a single, 
simple definition is insufficient to capture the essence of the 
concept [25].”  This definition shows the plurality of the 
concept of trust. As seen in [26] the conception of trust arises 
in many disciplines like social psychology, philosophy, 
economics, law, marketing and others. These diverse 
disciplines also have different basic requirements about trust. 
The economists have a rational and calculative vision of 
trust, which contrasts with the attitudinal and ethical view of 
the philosophers. Social psychology emphasizes the 
reliability of the word and the fulfillment of obligations [27]. 
On the other hand, economics perceives trust as an answer to 
expected future behavior and suggests the usage of hostages 
to warrant rational behavior [28]. Furthermore, philosophy 
and social psychology emphasize the personal and 
interpersonal aspects, while law economics and marketing 
stress inter organizational trust. The fact that trust depends 
on additional situational and cultural elements, together with 
existence 
of 
diverse 
synonyms, 
highlights 
the 
multidimensional view of the concept and demonstrates why 
there is no uniform definition of the term [26].  
Castaldo et al. (2010) used a quantitative approach to 
illustrate and handle the heterogeneity of trust by means of a 
content analysis. By application of 36 definitions of the term 
“trust”, a frequency analysis was conducted. The numbers in 
co-occurrences show that attitude and behavior were used in 
most of the cases to explain trust [29]. 
To emphasize the diversity of the construct trust there are 
added numerous ‘trust relationships’. Personal trust, as self-
confidence, and interpersonal trust that comprises a human’s 
trust with another human [27][30][31] can be mentioned. 
[32] put their research focus on close relationships and stated 
that trust is not present from the beginning. It has to be built 
up through increasing experience with the other person. 
Moreover, social trust characterizes trust with a system or an 
institution [26], while trust in automation denotes a human’s 
trust with a technology or a device [33][34][35].  
“Uncertainty, vulnerability and the possibility of 
avoiding risk or of making a choice based on judgment, are 
seen as necessary conditions for the existence of trust” [26]. 
The enhanced uncertainty and complexity that has stimulated 
the latest interest in trust in various fields of research 
corresponds with the increased relevance of healthcare and 
trust in assistance systems and automation in general. Trust 
in technology induces reliance when the complexness makes 
a thorough understanding impossible.  
Turing (1950) was the first who analyzed trust between 
humans and machines in an experiment where a human had 
to differentiate between a human advisor and a computer 
simulating a human. 95 percent of the participants did not 
notice the difference and supposed that the advisor was a 
human. With the ‘Turing Effect’ the discussion about human 
trust in information given by automation compared to 
another human, was born [36].  
New and innovative technologies become increasingly 
complicated and humans cannot manage the full degree of 
complexity. Humans cannot fully understand the processes 
behind the automation. They have to rely on automation to 
use it in an adequate manner. Therefore, trust can be seen as 
a mediator between humans and automation by guiding 
reliance: “Trust can be defined as the attitude that an agent 
will help achieve an individual’s goals in a situation 
characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability” [37]. The 
agent is described as automation or as a person, which 
cooperates with the surrounding of the person [37].  
As seen in different studies, people have the tendency to 
rely on technology they have trust in and to reject technology 
they do not trust [33]. When people trust automation, the 
usage is often influenced positively [38][39]. But also 
negative examples exist due to inappropriate calibration of 
user trust. In one notable example, the cruise ship Royal 
Majesty ran aground because the crew did not realize that the 
navigation system did not work correctly. The system lost 
the GPS signal and the alarm did not inform the crew. 
Although it was obvious to see that the water became too 
shallow, the disaster was not averted. A subsequent report 
confirmed that the crew was overly reliant on the automated 
position display [40]. Another tragic example of distrust 
towards automation led to an airplane crash where 71 people 
lost their lives [41].  The collision near Überlingen at 
Bodensee in 2002 can be attributed to the ignorance towards 
the Traffic Collision and Alerting System (TCAS). Two 
airplanes were flying in the same height and the TCAS 
warned both about the imminent accident. It advised the 

80

Tupolew to ascend and the Boeing to descend but a human 
air traffic controller was not aware of the other airplane's 
position. He gave the conflicting advice to the Tupolew to 
descend. The Tupolew pilots’ followed the human's advice 
and thus the collision was caused. This case represents a 
typical dilemma of human advisory conflicting with 
automation advisory. These examples show the importance 
and impacts of trust towards technology. If trust is not 
calibrated to the true capacity of the system, users may over 
rely (misuse) or under rely/ reject (disuse) on the automation 
[42]. 
These considerations relating to trust in technology can 
also have impact in the area of healthcare and AAL. As seen 
in [43], trust in medical technology is empirically different 
from trust in other technology. Based on [35], which deal 
with patients and healthcare providers in obstetric work 
systems, important implications for trust in healthcare 
systems 
and 
AAL-Technology 
emerge. 
The 
study 
demonstrates that trust building in medical technology 
transpires not only in a relationship between doctor and 
patient or patient and technology. There is a complex 
network of relationships, which ultimately forms a ‘network 
of trust’ in technology use. [44] has already observed a 
network of trust in supervisory control systems. In addition 
to the sys-tem she included a system designer, operators, 
management and society as other actors. Trust as a factor 
attributed to AAL systems, is also affected by a significant 
amount of implicit trust in the network around the use of the 
actual technology. Following the ‘Actor Network Theory’ 
[45][46], the reliance on the network located around the 
AAL system, is equally important for the usage of assistive 
technology. As an example, for [47] the use of a defibrillator 
implies not only trust in the product and its functions but also 
in the network around this product. This network includes 
the product designer, the organization, which implements the 
product and the coaches, explaining the technology to the 
inexperienced users [47]. It follows that distrust in a health 
care provider can also lead to patients’ distrust in medical 
technology or the hospital per se [48]. Therefore, 
consideration of the social or work system [49], which 
encapsulates 
the 
technology, 
is 
necessary 
for 
an 
understanding of trust. Reference [35] clarified that in the 
case of complex medical or assistance technology, building 
trust in automation is more accurately building trust in a 
work system. Furthermore, during the use of the same 
system the perspectives of multiple user groups (end user, 
relatives, and health care provider) vary [35].  
In summary, it can be seen that there are a lot of factors, 
which differ in the formation of trust and, which have to be 
considered in the development and application of AAL. Due 
to the importance of the concept of trust it is necessary to 
develop a working definition as a basis for further research 
activities in AAL. The following definition based on the 
above mentioned definitions of AAL [6][21][23] and the 
definition by [37] in context with automation.  
 Trust in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) can be de-fined 
as the attitude that an assistive technology supports an 
impaired person within their social environment in an 
uncertain and vulnerable situation. 
AAL also offers holistic support for persons with 
disabilities, not only to those over the age of 60 years. The 
combination of human and technical services by modular 
and customized technology generates various possibilities. 
Since users will not completely understand the technology 
and processes of AAL, the attitude trust helps to influence 
the usage of AAL. 
III. 
RESEARCH FRAMEWORK 
A literature review was conducted to explore the relevant 
scientific approaches in the context of trust in AAL, 
healthcare assistance systems and other automation. By 
means of this research method, information about how 
extensively the issue has been previously addressed in the 
research can be ascertained. To increase the precision of the 
literature review in this innovative and fast moving research 
field, relevant articles were identified by means of 
computerized search in the online bibliographic databases 
‘Web of Science’ [50] ‘PubMed’ [51] and ‘PsycINFO’ [52] 
starting in November 2010 up to a publication date of 
January 2011. The three database searches are carried out 
with filter. In ‘Web of Science’ key search terms are filtered 
by topic, in ‘PubMed’ by MeSH Terms and in ‘PsycINFO’ 
by keywords. These three different terminologies represent 
the generic terms for the search algorithm in the respective 
database. 
For investigation in the three databases, 150 dissimilar 
search term combinations are performed in each setting. The 
used key search terms are presented in Table I. The first 
search requests always contain a term of the categories 
'Attributes' and 'Auxiliaries'. At first, the term trust has been 
set and was queried alternatively with the keywords of the 
descriptor 'Auxiliaries'. After carrying out these searches, the 
term reliance was set and also requested with those from the 
second category. Then, the already carried out 30 search 
combinations have been linked sequentially to the concepts 
of the third descriptor 'Population'. By extending the research 
with these four search terms and consideration of the 
abbreviations AAL and ATS, ultimately 150 searches per 
database were performed.  
Due to the large number of search combinations and 
potentially relevant studies, the search results are already 
reviewed for further availability during the database search. 
For this, both title and abstract are considered. Afterwards, to 
identify the relevant full text articles a set of exclusion 
criteria are selected. For inclusion in the literature review 
articles had to fulfill the following criteria:

(1) The study described explicitly the connection 
between trust and automation or assistive technology, 
whereby trust is seen as an influence factor for the 
interaction with the system  
(2)  The article was published in a journal or presented 
at an international conference 
(3)  Studies, which were first presented at a conference 
and afterwards published with identical findings as a journal 
article, were only taken into consideration with the journal 
release  
(4)  The publication was written in English  
(5) Due to the database research date, studies are 
included up until January 2011. 
A data form was used to remove the important 
information for each relevant article. After structuring the 
articles and integrating the data in the fact sheet, a detailed 
data analysis was undertaken. 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
The previously described 150 search term combinations 
in each database initially identified 8,498 potentially relevant 
articles for the literature review. By means of the structural 
query, the database 'Web of Science’ offered 4,401 
publications. The database 'PubMed' yielded 3,855 results 
and the search requests in 'PsycINFO' provided 242 studies. 
Owing to the consideration of the above described five 
exclusion criteria and after analyzing titles and abstracts of 
the 8,498 studies, 164 publications are used in the next part 
of the review. In this step, the full text of these 164 articles 
was reviewed. After analysis of the full text versions, 92 
articles were included for the further literature analysis. With 
regard to the exclusion criteria, a total of 72 of the filtered 
studies were excluded, leaving 56 percent of the original 164 
articles. Fig. 1 gives a numerical overview about the 
structural sequence of the literature research.  
Because of the five exclusion criteria shown above, 72 
articles (44 percent) were excluded after the full text review.  
 
Figure 1.  Literature research sequence diagram (authors design). 
 
Most of the studies (48 articles) are not relevant due to the 
wrong topic focus. 15 of these studies had focused on trust in 
websites/ online platforms as well as trust in e-commerce 
applications and are not followed up owing to the exclusion 
criterion. A further 17 studies are eliminated since they were 
not published at a conference or in a journal. The last seven 
excluded articles were published once in a journal and 
additionally published at a conference with almost identical 
results. These studies are only considered one time with the 
more current journal article in our results. Thus, in the end, 
92 articles were analyzed in detail in the literature review.  
These articles covered the topics trust in automotive 
[53][54][55][56][56][57], aviation [40][58][59][60][61][62] 
[63][64][65], combat identification [66][67][68][69][70],

systems 
[38][39][75][76][77][78], 
healthcare and assistance systems [79][80][81][82][83][84] 
and others [85][86]. 
As can be seen in Fig. 2, with a total of 18 articles the 
cluster ‘Healthcare and Assistance Systems’ has the largest 
number of relevant studies. This fact can be explained due to 
the specific key search terms in the descriptor ‘Auxiliaries’ 
(e.g., 
‘Healthcare’, 
‘Assistance/Assistive 
System/ 
Technology’, or ‘Medical Technology’) in the first step of 
the literature search. These articles will be analyzed with 
special regard in the further course of the study. Firstly, the 
other six clusters with focus on measuring and analyzing 
trust in technology will be briefly addressed. 
Diverse computerized trials and experiments relating to 
trust in automation and assistance by means of transportation 
‘Aviation’ (16 articles) or ‘Automotive’ (11 articles) were 
performed. In the consideration of the articles in the cluster 
‘Aviation’, the focus is on research in air traffic control (e.g., 
[62][63][65] and multitask flight simulation [40][59][58]. 
The background of this field of research is that pilots’ trust in 
alarms or cues within cockpit automation has impact on the 
usage of autopilot systems. Recent results can be found in 
[60][61][64].  
In the cluster ‘Automotive’, reliance in automotive

adaptive cruise control systems [57][87], advanced traveler 
information systems [55] and particular automotive collision 
warning systems (e.g., [53][54]) play an important role in 
research. These computer-assisted experiments aim to 
analyze trust in different alarm types as false alarm (FA) or 
unnecessary alarms (UA) in simulated driving situations 
[56]. 
Furthermore, in the last decade the military has integrated 
the factor of trust in ‘Combat Identification’ in its research 
projects [66][70]. The literature research included 12 studies 
on this military subject. The authors in this cluster examined 
the effects of trust and human responses to automation alerts 
and false alerts. Participants, who are performing simulated 
combat tasks, often have to analyze aerial photographs for 
the presence of enemy targets. Research developments can 
be seen in [67][68][69]. 
In addition, 13 articles, among eight former literature 
reviews, observe trust in ‘General Design Advancement’ 
[33][37][73][74]. Jian, Bisantz, and Drury (2000), the only 
quantitative study in this cluster, developed a trust 
questionnaire in human-machine interaction, which today is 
used for measuring trust in various automated systems [71].  
Further 14 articles deal with reliance on different 
‘Supervisory Control Systems’. Monitoring of luggage 
screening [76], pumping [37][39][78] and central heating 
systems [77] have been considered in this category. 
Moreover, Bahner, Hueper, and Manzey (2008) have 
regarded a process control system and the influence of 
complacency and automation bias in interacting with a 
decision aid in this context [75]. Finally, a cluster called 
‘Others’ was created for including all studies, which cannot 
be integrated in one of the before mentioned sub items. 
These articles concentrate for example on trust in tele-
operation systems [88], automation etiquette [86] or trust in 
an automated counting and circle estimation task [85]. 
A. Data analyses of overall results 
In the next step, the data sheet with the overall studies 
has been analyzed (A) and compared with the results from 
the topic trust in healthcare and assistance systems (B). 
(1) Publication date  
Between 1987 and 1991 only two studies were published 
in this context [33][34]. The first experiment of trust in a 
human-machine supervisory control system was realized by 
[38]. Whereas, up until 1999, 15 studies were published in 
total, from 2000 to 2010, 77 articles with regard to trust in 
technology and assistance systems can be found. Since 2003, 
every year six studies or more are indicated. In 2008, a 
maximum of 11 relevant articles are found. 
(2) Type of study 
In a next step, the distinction between conceptual and 
empirical/experimental articles is examined. From the 
overall 92 reviewed studies, 22 consider conceptual and 70 
empirical methods for their research. These conceptual 
articles comprise former summaries and literature reviews 
(12 articles) as well as articles with the focus on framework, 
model or questionnaire development (10 articles). The 70 
empirical articles can be differentiated into quantitative and 
qualitative research methods. Since 1987, in total 62 
quantitative studies (including experiments, online, postal or 
paper standardized questionings or a combination of 
experiment and questioning) were identified. It can be 
observed, that only five studies include questionnaires only. 
In contrast, 57 studies used experiments or a combination of 
experiments and questionnaires for measuring trust. By 
comparison, eight articles with qualitative methods as 
qualitative interviews, workshops and focus group interviews 
were considered.  
(3) Participants characteristics 
In a next step, the participants’ age distribution is 
considered. In order to receive a better understanding of the 
participants in experiments or surveys, a clustering into five 
age groups was conducted. These groups were subdivided 
into ‘participants younger than 30 years’ ‘participants from 
30 to 60 years’, as well as ‘participants older than 60 years’. 
Moreover, one age group comprised a combination of 
younger (< 30 years) as well as older (> 60 years) 
participants. Further studies performed experiments or 
interviews without age differentiation.  
Regarding the 70 empirical studies, in 22 of the studies or 
31 percent, there was no age differentiation declared. In 35 
surveys participants were younger than 30 years and in five 
surveys they were between the ages of 30 and 60 years. In 
only eight surveys (16 percent of overall) were participants 
older than 60 years. In five articles the participants 
exclusively belonged to the age group over 60 years. In three 
further studies both younger participants (< 30 years) and 
people over the age of 60 were examined. 
Participation rates range from an experiment with six 
[89] or a qualitative interview with nine participants [90] to a 
postal survey with 1187 participants [91]. In total, in 43 of 
the articles (61 percent) less than 50 participants took part in 
the surveys on trust in automation or assistance systems. In 
eight studies between 51 and 100 and in 16 studies between 
101 and 500 participants were involved. Reference [91] was 
the only study with more than 500 participants. In two 
articles there was no participant number specified. Moreover, 
only three out of the surveys contained a limitation with 
regard to the gender. One study by [82] questioned 24 
women, or rather 24 mothers who had recently given birth. 
In two other articles only male participants, former pilots 
[92] and students [93], were surveyed. In 38 surveys both 
gender were examined and 29 surveys did not make an 
explicit distinction. 
(4) Publication type 
Another study detail can be carried out by the 
differentiation between ‘conference vs. journal publication’. 
Among the 92 examined articles, 18 articles (20 percent) 
were presented at a corresponding conference and 74 articles 
published in a journal. The journal with the most 
publications and major interest in the research of trust and 
automation was ‘Human Factors’ with a total of 21 articles 
(23 percent). The journal ‘Ergonomic’, with eight relevant 
articles, the ‘International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics’, 
with four and several journals with three studies follow.

B. Data analysis of studies regarding trust in healthcare 
and assistance systems’ 
This rising relevance of the concept of trust, which can 
be found in the different research topics, is also evident by 
the large number of relevant articles in trust and ‘healthcare 
and assistance systems’. In this field of research interest has 
been increasing in the last decade.  
(1) Publication date  
The first published paper relating to trust in healthcare 
automation was presented in 2002. The conference paper by 
[86] was the first article that emphasized the factor trust. 
From this point on until January 2011, 18 articles can be 
found. These articles deal with reliance on healthcare, 
medical or household assistance systems. In the years 2003, 
2004 and 2006 no publications within this context can be 
found, whereas since 2007, every year articles are 
considered. 2010 revealed the largest number of studies in 
field, with five published. Fig. 3 gives a detailed overview 
about the annual distribution of the studies in the cluster 
‘healthcare and assistance systems’ in comparison to the 
other topics. As can be seen, the importance of a conscious 
handling and perception of the concept of trust in 
combination with automation and, particularly, healthcare 
and assistance systems has been increasing in recent years. 
The first study with regard to trust in automation and human-
machine interaction was published in 1987 [33]. In contrast, 
the first publication regarding trust as a variable for 
developing healthcare systems for older persons was 
presented in 2002 [81]. 
(2) Type of study 
Four of the 18 articles in this cluster used conceptual 
methodologies. Three articles focused on framework or 
model development [79][81][83] and one study summarized 
the relevance of training in technology used by tele-home 
care nurses [84]. Moreover, 14 articles included empirical 
research–seven used quantitative and seven qualitative 
methods. The publications with quantitative methodologies 
are divided into three studies with a combination of 
questionnaire and experimental design, two studies with 
 
Figure 3.  Year distribution of studies in ‘healthcare and assistance 
systems‘ vs. other topics (authors design). 
 
exclusive questionnaire surveys and two with experiments. 
The qualitative research exclusively consists of articles with 
qualitative interviews. 
In comparison, within the other topics quantitative 
studies dominate with 55 studies. In particular, in new 
research areas qualitative surveys are utilized to get a 
detailed understanding of the topic. For this purpose, the 
focus is set on qualitative interviews, as has occurred in the 
research area of trust in healthcare and assistance systems. 
Seven of the overall 18 studies (39 percent) included 
qualitative interviews with individuals or workshop and 
focus group discussions. In 2010, four studies used 
qualitative interviews, which show that researchers are still 
in the process of developing a detailed understanding. Given 
that general research on trust in human-machine interaction 
started in 1987 [33] and to this day ambiguities in this 
context exist [60][61][94] it is understandable that qualitative 
interviews are still used in this research area. 
(3) Participants characteristics 
For the 14 empirical articles an age group differentiation 
was performed. In three of the studies, participants were 
younger than 30 years and in one study they are between 30 
and 60 years. Moreover, five of the articles consider 
participants over the age of 60 years. Further two studies 
consider a combination of younger and older participants, 
while three surveys give no information about age 
differentiation. Where the work system is in healthcare and 
assistance systems such as AAL, the end user is mostly over 
the age of 60. Therefore, it is of immense relevance that this 
target group will be considered in the research. Fig. 4 
displays the previous study numbers, in which participants 
over 60 years were involved. 
As can be seen, in the other clusters the target group of 
people over the age of 60 plays only a subordinate role. Only 
one author has considered elderly persons’ trust in a human-
decision aid system and compared the results to people 
younger than 30 years [85].  
In contrast, in the healthcare sector researchers have 
focused more on the age group over 60 years. Of the total of

eight studies that have dealt with participants over 60 years, 
seven studies (88 percent) are located in this cluster. Two 
studies have taken a differentiation of younger and elderly 
persons into account [80][95]. Moreover, five articles have 
exclusively 
focused 
on 
people 
over 
60 
years 
[90][96][97][98][99]. In 50 percent of the overall studies, 
which analyze the factor of trust in healthcare and assistance 
systems by experiments or surveys, the age group over 60 
years is strongly represented.  
Concerning the number of participants in the topic 
‘healthcare and assistance systems‘, in nine of the studies the 
participant rate amounted to less than 50 participants. In two 
studies the participant rate ranged from 51 to 100 persons 
and three articles took more than 100 participants into 
account. These articles also include the reference [91] with a 
postal questionnaire of 1187 people. With reference to the 
participant rate it can be highlighted that the study with the 
most participants [91] as well as one of the studies with the 
least participants (n=9) [90] belong to the topic trust in 
healthcare and assistance systems. 
Regarding the gender distinction within the different 
methodological designs, 12 articles have regarded both 
sexes; one article made no differentiation and one study [82] 
viewed only female participants. This study with solely 
female participants interviewed 24 women who had recently 
given birth. They were questioned in a qualitative interview 
to analyze trust in medical technology and obstetrics work 
system [82]. For the observation of this complex work 
system additional interviews with care providers were 
conducted [35]. Furthermore, it can be said that healthcare 
and technical support for elderly persons are themes, which 
concern men and women equally. Therefore, it seems logical 
that most of the studies deal with both genders.  
(4) Publication type  
Moreover, among the 18 studies, six articles (33 percent) 
are presented as conference papers and 12 articles (67 
percent) 
were 
published 
in 
journals. 
The 
journal 
‘Ergonomics’ with two publications was the only one, which 
was represented several times. The author Enid Montague 
with four research studies since 2009 has taken a pioneering 
role in context of trust and healthcare technology 
[35][43][82][83]. Additionally, Coughlin et al. (2007, 2009) 
and Ho et al. (2005a, 2005b) are listed with two articles 
[79][80][96][100].  
Due to the topical nature of the research field, the 
distribution of articles presented at conferences and 
published in journals can be explained. From the overall 18 
studies in the healthcare cluster, 12 were published in 
journals and six studies were presented at conferences. By 
comparison, from 74 articles within the other topics, 62 were 
published in journals and 12 studies, thus 16 percent, were 
presented at conferences. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The significant increase of elderly persons due to 
demographic change and the resulting rise in purchasing 
power is affecting the development of reliable AAL systems 
[101]. Since 2005 the European and national sponsoring 
programs for AAL have steadily increased the relevance of 
supported living in a home environment, which enlarges and 
promotes personal independence. Moreover, it is difficult to 
understand why AAL has had absolutely no consideration in 
combination with measuring trust in the research literature. 
The search combinations ‘reliance or trust’ and ‘Ambient 
Assisted Living/ AAL’ yielded no results in the current 
literature study. There was no study explicitly examining 
trust in AAL systems. Moreover, the relevance of measuring 
trust in healthcare technology and assistance systems is not 
prominent within the research results. It can be seen that the 
consideration of trust in connection with healthcare, medical 
technology or assistance systems is still in a nascent stage. A 
few studies considered trust in intelligent home systems 
[100], smart home [96], telemedicine systems [98], as well 
as automation [95] or technology [90] at home. Furthermore, 
it must be noted, that there is no consistent terminology for 
assistance systems for elderly persons. No systematic 
approach and documentation or a uniform technology and 
understanding 
exist 
in research, 
which 
complicated 
measuring trust in this context.  
On one hand, these results could imply that the topic has 
not been viewed as a relevant scholarly topic. On the other 
hand, due to the increasing number of studies in the last 
decade, this suggestion seems not to be supported. Analyzing 
the publication date shows that all relevant articles were 
composed in this period. It is evident that the research field 
has gained in importance in the last decade.  
Another interesting fact can be found in the different 
frequency distribution of quantitative and qualitative studies. 
In the analysis of the type of study it can be highlighted that 
researchers who are examining trust in healthcare and 
assistance systems use qualitative as well as quantitative 
methodologies. The fact that trust in healthcare and 
assistance systems do not singularly depend on technology 
but rather on a complex work system [35][47], underlines the 
relevance of more substantial research into this topic. 
Moreover, 
researchers 
have 
recognized 
that 
the 
characteristics of elderly participants have been taken into 
account. An analysis of trust in this sector can only be 
realized by the integration of people over the age of 60. 
Seven articles in the last decade consider older participants’ 
trust in healthcare and home assistance systems. The 
increasing demand and importance of AAL due to the higher 
life expectancy and demographic shift clarify a considerable 
backlog demand in measuring elderly persons’ trust in AAL. 
More research into this age group is required to fill the gap 
left by the few studies and quantitative results. Finally, it can 
be surmised that by reason of the novelty of the research of 
measuring trust as an influencing factor for using healthcare 
and assistance systems, the exact influence of trust cannot be 
quantified. Only 18 articles, which cover that topic, were 
found owing to the literature review. Initial developments 
reveal that trust in healthcare and medical technology differs 
from reliance on other technologies [43].  
Both, qualitative and quantitative research is required to 
cope with increasing demands in the coming years. 
Furthermore, more elderly participants must be taken into 
account for measuring and conceiving trust in an AAL 
system. In order to ascertain trust the elderly have in AAL, a

deeper understanding of their needs as well as fears and 
worries is essential. Additionally, trust of reference persons 
may have influence in using AAL. For researchers and 
designers of AAL, recognizing the influencing factor of trust 
will support the development of marketable solutions.  
Due to the knowledge gained by the literature review, 
further research in the context of elderly persons’ trust in 
AAL will be conducted. Based on the results of the present 
study, the variables regarding trust in AAL have to be 
examined in a next step. The investigation conforms the 
various influence factors on trust in AAL and beyond the 
connection to the usage intention. For this, a scenario-based 
questionnaire survey and additional experiments will be 
performed. The experiments include mock-ups of AAL 
technology on tablet PCs. Different scenarios will be 
conducted by older test persons. The impact of personal and 
technical assistance within AAL will be examined and 
afterwards reliability of AAL technology manipulated.  
LIMITATIONS 
The systematic review had to contend with some 
limitations in the research process. First, the selection of 
online databases should be considered. Literature for trust in 
automation and healthcare can be seen as an interdisciplinary 
field. Therefore, three bibliographic databases were used: 
‘Web of Science’ comprising of interdisciplinary content 
across 256 disciplines; the database ‘PubMed’ focusing on 
healthcare content; and ‘PsycINFO’, psychological literature. 
Due to this selection, articles, which are not integrated in 
these databases, are excluded for the review. Second, the 
information provided in the articles is very heterogenic. 
Some include a specific description about the experimental 
design, while other studies fail to provide detailed 
information. Third, due to the fact that only English language 
articles were included in the review, a distorted picture is 
drawn, as the studies focus on English-speaking authors. 
Fourth and finally, the studies included in the literature re-
view were screened up until January 2011. Thus, articles, 
which were published afterwards, are not considered for this 
systematic review.
