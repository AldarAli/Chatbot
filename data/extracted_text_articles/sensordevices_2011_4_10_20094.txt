Abstract— We have fabricated a new multimodal sensor chip 
that is capable of measuring water content and nutrient 
concentration on-site simultaneously. Heretofore in agriculture, 
water content sensors, for example the TDR sensor, could not 
provide water content information correctly, since the results 
of these sensors are affected by the nutrient concentration in 
the soil solution. Therefore, tensiometers (shown in Fig. 1 (a)) 
have generally been used in agriculture. These are large-scale 
sensors and are not suitable for precision agriculture. Our 
proposed sensors are the world’s first to be able to monitor 
water content without being influenced by the nutrient 
concentration, and nutrient concentration without influence 
from the water content.

 INTRODUCTION  
On-site monitoring to enable precise control is becoming 
a requirement in agriculture.  In particular, accurate 
determination of the water content in soil and of the nutrient 
concentration in water is considered to be the most important 
information for increasing the production of agricultural 
crops. The water content is the proportion of water by 
volume with respect to everything else, usually air and soil 
clod. The nutrient concentration (which has the same 
meaning as ‘ion concentration’) [1] in water can generally be 
observed by electrical conductivity measurements.  
Fig. 1 shows how tensiometers can measure water 
content by utilizing the moisture-holding ability of soils. 
Because tensiometers have simple mechanisms and are 
reasonably priced, many farmhouses use them. However, 
they can’t measure the ion concentration and can’t be set 
near the roots of plants because of their large size. Hence, 
tensiometers are unsuitable for precise on-site monitoring. 
In the case of on-site monitoring in soil, it is difficult to 
separate electrical conductivity information from water 
content information. For example, when the nutrient ion 
concentration is 1 S/m and the water content is 0.5 m3/m3, 
the measurement result of electrical conductivity is 0.5 S/m.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  These pictures show how a multimodal sensor is used for on-
site monitoring of two kinds of plant beds in precision agriculture. 
 
Therefore, for the measurement of water content and to 
obtain information about the nutrient concentration in soil, 
time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors [2][3] and thermal 
type sensors [4] have been studied by other groups. These 
sensors measure water content information and electrical 
conductivity information separately, and then information 
about nutrient concentration is elicited by eliminating water 
content data from the electrical conductivity data. These 
water content sensors require high frequency (> 1 GHz) 
operation, or for the soil to be heated in order to measure 
complete water content values without the effects of nutrient 
concentration. In addition, the sensor sizes are not small 
enough (length, width: > 2 cm) to be incorporated with an 
electronic control system.  
We have proposed a new multimodal sensor chip that is 
capable 
of 
measuring 
water 
content 
and 
nutrient 
concentration on-site simultaneously. The sensor is small in 
size and is capable of operating at lower frequency than TDR 
by employing new calculation methods. 
In this paper, after introducing the basic concepts 
regarding the background and motivation of our research in  
Section Ⅰwe formulated  the  theoretical and  mathematical 
concepts in Section Ⅱ. In later sections such as in Section Ⅲ, 
we described  the material structure of the sensor; in Section

research. 
  
II. 
NEW MEASUREMENT METHODS 
A. Ion Concentration Measurement Method using Phase 
Measurement methods for water content are gauged 
against the dielectric constant. The relative permittivity of 
water, which is about 80, is larger than that of other materials 
commonly found in soil; for example, the relative 
permittivity of air is 1, and that of soil is about 5. In order to 
measure water capacitances and to eliminate the effect of ion 
concentration, TDR sensors operate at high frequencies of 
between 100 MHz and 1 GHz. However, the operating 
circuits that are required for high frequency operation are 
complex and costly, and the relative permittivity of water is 
also changed by ion concentration; the relative permittivity is 
80 at 7 mS/m ion concentration (tap water) and is 70 at 7 
S/m (seawater) [5]. 
We propose a new measurement method that measures 
the phase characteristics of water. This method analyzes the 
ion concentration information and is unaffected by the water 
content value. Equations 1 through 3 show the water 
characteristics using a parallel circuit model of resistance and 
capacitance.  
 
 
(1) 
 
 
,  
(2) 
 
 
  
(3) 
 
where, Ztotal is the combined impedance, Rwater is the 
resistance of water, Cwater is the capacitance of water, D is the 
distance along the direction of passing current, L and W are 
the length and width of the section area of the path of the 
passing current, σwater is the electrical conductivity (which 
provides information about ion concentration), εwater is the 
relative permittivity, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, θwater is 
the phase of Ztotal.  
 In the case of 50 % water per unit volume of soil, 
equation 3 changes to equation 4. In this equation, the phase 
remains almost unchanged with respect to water content 
information!  
 
 
 
  
(4) 
 
 
, 
 
 
In the case when the ion concentration changes from 7 
mS/m (tap water) to 7 S /m (seawater) in water without 
including soil, equation 3 changes to equation 5. In this 
equation, the phase is changed almost exclusively by the ion 
concentration for smaller relative permittivity changes!  
Because the phase at the highest sensitivity is π/4 rad, 
suitable frequencies for the input signals are between 500 
kHz and 10 MHz. Hence the frequencies used in our method 
are smaller than those used in TDR methods.

, 
 
 
 
 
B. Water Content Calculation Method using Phase and 
Electrical Conductivity Information 
Electrical conductivity sensors have been studied by our 
group in the past [6]. Since these sensors operate at the low 
frequency of 10 kHz, equation 1 changes to equation 6. This 
equation shows that the ion concentration of water without 
other materials can be measured using electrical conductivity. 
The value σwater represents exactly the electrical conductivity 
information. 
 
 
 
 
(6) 
 
 
In the case of 50 % water per unit volume of soil, the 
total electrical conductivity σtotal changes to equation 7. The 
equation shows that electrical conductivity is affected by the 
volume of water per unit volume, which is the same as being 
affected by the water content! 
 
 
(7) 
 
From these equations, the electrical conductivity can be 
determined by multiplying the water content by the ion 
concentration, and water content information can be 
calculated by using equation 8. 
 
 
(8) 
where WC is the water content information, IC is the ion 
concentration information shown by equation 5, and EC is 
the electrical conductivity information shown by 7.

STRUCTURE OF A SENSOR DEVICE 
We fabricated a multimodal sensor with a Pt electrode 
area to measure electrical conductivity and a capacitive 
probe area to measure phase information, as shown in Fig. 2. 
Because the multimodal sensor is very small and can be 
fabricated by CMOS process technology, it was possible to 
insert the sensor into several kinds of plant beds. Images of 
two kinds of experiments using our multimodal sensor in 
agricultural applications are shown in Fig. 1. 
 
The Pt electrodes for sensing electrical conductivity had 
been studied previously [6]. The sensing method is capable 
of measurement covering a wide range, between 1 mS/m 
and 10 S/m. The voltage was applied using a 10 kHz sine-
wave and was of 250 mV in amplitude. Characteristically, 
the Pt electrodes can apply an electric current to a solution 
at low frequency, for example, 10 kHz, since the effects of 
electrical double layers on the Pt electrodes and of the 
parasitic capacitance of water can be minimized at this 
frequency. 
In the capacitive probe area, Al electrodes were covered 
with a thin SiNx film (50 nm thickness) to protect them 
from the solution and to lower the electrical current. The 
SiNx parasitic capacitance had to be designed to be larger 
than the capacitance of water since the SiNx and the 
parasitic capacitance of water were connected in series. The 
SiOx parasitic capacitance under the Al electrode-area had 
to be designed to be smaller than the capacitance of water, 
because the SiOx and parasitic capacitance of water were 
connected in parallel. 
The SiNx on the top film and the SiOx under the Al 
electrodes were designed to be 50 nm and 1 μm in thickness 
respectively.  In this experiment, the applied voltage used a 
500 kHz sine wave of 250 mV amplitude. Measurement at 
500 kHz produced a larger range of phase changes for (θwater) 
between 0 and -90 degrees.

IV. 
MEASUREMENT RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 3 shows images of an experiment to determine 
changes in water content (shown in Fig. 3 (a)), and in ion 
concentration (shown in Fig. 3(b)). A solution of tap water 
and common salt (NaCl) was used for the ion concentration 
test. When the water content is 1.0 m3/m3, as shown in Fig. 3 
(b), then the electrical conductivity and the ion concentration 
are the same. 
The graph in Fig. 4 shows that the results of the phase 
measurement of the water element are changed due to the ion 
concentration alone (shown in Fig. 4 (a)), and not by the 
water content (shown in Fig. 4 (b))! The graph in Fig. 5 
shows that electrical conductivity information is composed 
of the water content (shown in Fig. 5 (a)) and the ion 
concentration (shown in Fig. 5 (b)). This graph shows that 
the electrical conductivity information is the water content 
multiplied by the ion concentration!

CONCLUSION 
A small multimodal sensor capable of providing on-site 
measurement of water content and ion concentration over a 
small area (for example, near to plant roots) was fabricated 
using CMOS circuit process technology. We proposed new 
measurement methods for ion concentration and water 
content determination, and designed appropriate film 
thicknesses, materials and so on for novel multimodal sensor 
devices. From phase information measured using a 
capacitance probe, ion concentration information that was 
unaffected by water content information could be gathered 
over a wide measurement range. When using Pt electrodes, 
the electrical conductivity could be determined by 
multiplying water content by ion concentration. We 
succeeded in measuring the water content without any effect 
caused by ion concentration (that is, nutrient concentration) 
and in measuring ion concentration without any effect from 
water content when using the new multimodal sensor.
