I. INTRODUCTION  
   Vehicles were first invented to facilitate the transportation 
of people. In 1769, the first stream road engine was invented 
by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot [1]. A few years later, vehicles 
used the internal combustion engines powered by hydrogen 
and oxygen mixture [2]. Vehicles became gasoline powered 
in 1885 [3], and the first true electric car was invented in 1888 
[4]. Electric cars were popular between the 19th and 20th 
centuries due to their level of comfort and ease of operation. 
Since then, vehicles had been improved so much especially 
with the introduction of artificial intelligence in 1960 [5]. 
Researchers started to think of ways to overcome the driver’s 
role, so they added autonomy to vehicles. Autonomy allowed 
vehicles to be categorized from a regular vehicle with no 
autonomous characteristics to full autonomous vehicle 
capable of moving by itself. In 2019, level 3 autonomous 
vehicle, Tesla Model 3, had been introduced to the market 
[6]. 
   Autonomous vehicles include the classical vehicle 
characteristics with the additional autonomy flavor. They are 
expected to collect enormous data from various sources and 
replace humans in driving. These accumulating data will be 
huge and will open further research venues for many fields 
including technological, data science, and security. With full 
autonomy, humans are no longer needed to control the 
vehicle’s movements. However, autonomy as defined by 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration varies 
depending on the way the control functions are handled by 
the vehicle. The full autonomous vehicle extracts information 
from the surrounding environment via various signals, 
analyzes these signals and executes appropriate path of 
movement [7].  This implies that in all the phases of this 
procedure, human will not even play any role in the 
environmental perception. With these high control functions, 
the vehicle becomes more dependent on communication 
networks internally and with exterior environment [8]. This 
exceedingly reliance on communication networks will unlock 
the gates for even more sophisticated security attacks.  There 
are two types of communications in autonomous vehicles, 
Inter-vehicle and intra-vehicle communications [8]. Intra-
vehicle communications, represented by buses, are 
responsible for data transfer between the autonomous 
vehicle’s components. Inter-vehicle communications deals 
with transferring of data between the vehicle and the external 
environment including other vehicles, infrastructure and 
smart road signs. This makes the autonomous vehicle more 
vulnerable to various security attacks that are classified based 
on type of the attacker, motivation for the attack, type of the 
attack, and the target for the attack [9]. Consequently, the 
attacker will be able to collect information from the 
autonomous vehicle, modify it, and cause harm for both 
vehicles, their passengers, and possibly passengers of other 
vehicles. Thus, innovative and leading-edge security 
measures will be demanding due to the sophistication of the 
communication process.   
   To ensure autonomous vehicle network security and avoid 
potential attacks, different defenses have been proposed. 
These security techniques satisfy a collection of requirements 
pointed out by data integrity, data confidentiality, user and in-
vehicle authentication, and availability [10].  For this reason, 
new cryptographic techniques should be established to 
enhance the autonomous vehicle’s security and ensure that 
the original data is not altered to make certain vehicle’s 
performance will not deteriorate and the safety for all is 
granted.   
   This paper deals with surveying the current and future 
technology of autonomous vehicle and its security. To this 
end, the levels of autonomous vehicles are introduced in 
Section II. Section III presents the architectural technology of 
autonomous vehicles, and the threats that autonomous 
vehicles are vulnerable to are explained in Section IV. 
Autonomous vehicle security is covered in Section V. The 
paper is then concluded in Section VI. 
II. AUTONOMPUS VEHICLE LEVELS 
   The mission of full autonomous vehicle is to transport 
passengers to their destination without the need for a human 
driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) defines autonomous vehicle as “those in which at 
least one aspect of safety-critical control function occurs 
without direct driver input” [11]. This definition reveals that 
autonomous vehicles are categorized by levels ranging from 
Level 1 to Level 5 [12] [13]. According to NHTSA, Cruise 
control, automatic braking, and lane keeping are considered 
examples of automation systems, or safety-critical control 
functions.

as 
autonomous vehicle. Level 0 refers to vehicles with no 
autonomy. The driver in Level 0 autonomous vehicles has full 
control over all tasks within the vehicle. Both NHTSA and 
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [11] [14] depicted 
the levels of autonomy as shown in Figure 1.  
   The five levels of autonomous vehicle represent the various 
magnitude of automation that the vehicle is equipped with. 
The transition from a lower level to a higher level signifies 
the increase in automation.  This style will continue until full 
automation (Level 5) is reached.   
 
 
Figure 1. NHTSA and SAE Autonomous Vehicles Levels 
A. Level 1 - Driver Assistant 
   At this level, the driver is responsible for monitoring the 
outer environment and taking decisions to control the 
vehicle’s movements. The system shares only one of the 
control functions with the driver: steering and acceleration 
speed, or braking control [15].  Human will execute most of 
the driving tasks [16]. An example of Level 1 autonomous 
vehicle is Jaguar Land Rover. The vehicle is responsible for 
off-road cruise control. In an off-road cruise control, the driver 
is responsible for steering while the system will set the 
appropriate speed. The maximum speed is predetermined by 
the driver [17].  
B. Level 2 - Partial Automation 
   The automated system is in charge of two of the primary 
control functions of driving at this level [11]. It fully controls 
the steering and acceleration tasks with limited driving 
conditions [18]. The driver handles the remaining tasks 
including environmental monitoring. An example of Level 2 
autonomous vehicle is Tesla Model S [19]. Tesla introduced a 
technology that makes the vehicle capable of accelerating, 
maintaining lane position, and parking without the help of the 
driver. The driver is only responsible for holding the steering 
wheel and monitoring the environment [19].  
C. Level 3 - Conditional Automation 
   The automated system is fully responsible for monitoring 
the environment and performing the safety-critical functions. 
The automated system will handle driving and monitor the 
envrionment.  The autonomous vehicle anticipates the driver 
to accomplish backup for the system and resume driving 
when needed [1]. The difference between Level 2 and Level 
3 autonomous vehicles is that at Level 3 the driver may not 
constantly monitor the environment during driving. The 
system can share this task with the driver [11].  
D. Level 4 - High Automation 
   The vehicle at this level is fully charged to control driving. 
The difference between Level 3 and 4 is characterized by the 
needed interference of the driver in case of failure. This 
implies that Level 3 system expects the intervention of driver 
for backup, but Level 4 system works without any 
expectation from the driver [12]. This level has some 
limitations determined by maximum speed, and low speed, 
and adverse weather conditions, such as snow falling [20]. 
E. Level 5 - Full Automation 
   Level 5 does not expect the vehicle to have steering wheel 
and performs all environmental analysis and planning 
techniques to reach destination by itself  [18]. Level 5 
vehicles are similar to level 4 but with with no limitations 
[20]. The vehicle at this level will no longer need steering 
wheel, pedals or human to control tasks [16]. Google is 
working on building Level 5 autonomous vehicle through its 
company Waymo [21].  This level could be referred to as full 
vehicle automation. 
III. CURRENT STATE OF VEHICLE AUTONOMY 
   Autonomous levels describe the role human plays while 
driving. However, Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicles are not 
implemented yet. This is due to the difficulty of making the 
system totally reliable on itself without expecting human 
interference. This means that the vehicle will fully analyse 
and even take care of any failure case [22]. At the present 
time, the autonomous vehicle technology lends itself to Level 
3 autonomous vehicle. In Table I, autonomous vehicles 
currently manufactured by auto industry are demonstrated. 
Moreover, many manufacturers announced that they will 
have Level 4 autonomous vehicles available in year 2020-
2021 including Toyota, Volvo, Renault-Nissan, Hyundai, and 
Ford [24].

IV. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE THREATS 
   Understanding the autonomous vehicle threats stems from 
understanding 
the 
sophisticated 
autonomous 
vehicle 
technology and architecture. The autonomous vehicle needs to 
analyze data from the surrounding environment. These data 
are collected from perception sensors, other vehicles and 
various smart infrastructures [7].  
A. Autonomous Vehicle Architecture 
   When analyzing the security of a system and identifying the 
associated threats, it is essential to understand the underlying 
architecture to establish the needed security protocols. The 
way autonomous vehicle analyses things is similar to people’s 
action-perception technique. The approach consists of 
perception, planning and control systems [7] [8] [26]. First, 
the perception system is responsible for sensing the 
environment and finding out the location of the autonomous 
vehicle [27]. The location can be represented in three ways; 
relative location, absolute location, and hybrid location [7]. 
Relative location is calculated by adding the distance and 
orientation of the vehicle to the initial position. The global 
positioning system, GPS, is in charge of providing the 
absolute vehicle location. Hybrid location is a mixture of both, 
relative and absolute locations. The goal is to find the real-
time efficient location. Autonomous Vehicle uses the hybrid

location technique to localize itself [7]. Sensing the 
environment is represented by lane line identification, 
obstacle detection, and road signs analysis. This is delivered 
through cameras, LIDAR, and Radar [8]. The Light Detection 
and Ranging (LiDAR) supplies high-resolution, three-
dimensional information about the vehicle’s surrounding 
environment. Having completed the perception, the Planning 
System picks up data from perception system, analyzes it and 
makes the appropriate decision for movement. The input for 
this subsystem is a combination of the perception system’s 
output data, feedback from the control system, and the Inter-
vehicle communication data. Finally, the Control System 
implements the decision taken by the Planning System 
through a large number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs). 
This PPC architecture (perception, planning, and control 
architecture) is similar to perception, cognition, and action 
systems of the humans [28]. Details of these systems and their 
relationships are depicted in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. Internal Architecture of Autonomous Vehicle 
 
   For proper performance, each system needs three 
components; 
sensors, 
processors 
and 
communication 
technologies [29]. The autonomous vehicle, as shown in 
Figure 2 above, collects data from onboard sensors, such as 
camera, lidar and radar, and from outer components including 
vehicles and infrastructure. The communication technologies 
within these two categories are referred to as intra-vehicle 
communication and Inter-vehicle communications. Inter-
vehicle communication allows vehicle’s parts to communicate 
and exchange information. It employs different buses to 
achieve this communication, such as Control Area Network 
(CAN), FlexRay, Local Interconnect Network (LIN), Media 
Oriented System Transport (MOST), and ethernet [8]. The bus 
technologies used by two selected Autonomous Vehicles 
(AVs) are shown in Table II below.

Furthermore, the autonomous vehicles can collect real-time 
data from everything around it to enhance decisions taken by 
its planning system. These relations are categorized as vehicle 
to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to 
road signs (V2RS), vehicle to internet of things (V2IOT) and 
vehicle to everything (V2X). Inter-vehicle networks are 
divided into low power technologies, such as Bluetooth and 
Zigbee, and IEEE 802.11 family technologies including WiFi 
and Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), and 
base station driven technologies, such as Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and 
LongTerm Evolution for Vehicle (LTE-V) [8].  As depicted 
in Figure 3, the most popular networks, LTE-V and DSRC, 
currently deployed by the autonomous vehicles are 
demonstrated. 
 
Figure 3. Inter-Vehicle Communications- LTE-V and DSRC 
 
   Hence, the autonomous vehicle is vulnerable to security 
attacks due to increased internal communication (intra-vehicle 
communications) and Inter-vehicle communications.  
B. Autonomous Vehicle Threats 
   The autonomous vehicles are coupled to different 
communication techniques. This makes it vulnerable to 
different types of attacks. For example, the vehicle-to vehicle 
V2V connectivity in the autonomous vehicles increases the 
ability of the attacker to join multiple vehicles in a vehicular 
botnet [30]. The vehicular botnet is a collection of networked 
vehicles controlled by the attacker [31]. Here multiple bots 
will join botnet and will execute whatever the attacker 
instructs them to do to the vehicle network. Various attacks 
are provided in Section V. 
   Other types of security attacks include password and key 
attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), Network protocol attacks, 
and Rogue Updates attack [32]. The first one is classified into 
dictionary, rainbow and brute force attacks. The attacker tries 
multiple attempts by using list of words, precomputed hashes 
or alpha-numeric combination to crack the password [32]. In 
other words, the attackers try to discover passwords by using 
every possible password commonly used and stored in a 
predefined file or database. In brute force attack, attackers try 
every possible combination of letters, digits, and other 
characters to discover the password. Finally, Rainbow attack 
consumes less time than the other two types by using a large 
store of precomputed hashes and comparing the stolen hashed 
password with those in the store.  
   In autonomous vehicle, DoS attack can be achieved through 
single node (within a vehicle), V2V communication or V2I 
communication [33]. A bogus Electronic Control Unit 
(ECU), which can be any device that succeeds in 
communicating with the ECUs, can send huge number of 
messages to other ECUs (single node), and a vehicle or group 
of vehicles can initiate large number of messages to a vehicle 
or even the infrastructure (V2V or V2I).  Even worse, a bogus 
infrastructure can bombard vehicle with many messages 
(I2V). The Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DRC) 
and Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) are 
41

VEHICULAR 2019 : The Eighth International Conference on Advances in Vehicular Systems, Technologies and Applications

used as communication mediums that enable messages 
exchanged between vehicles and the entire Vehicle to 
Infrastructure (V2I) environment. Several types of attacks 
associated with wireless V2X communication protocols have 
been demonstrated by security experts that could disrupt the 
availability and the performance of autonomous vehicles. 
Potential Attack Scenarios include an attacker jamming the 
main wireless communication medium so that the network 
will no longer be available for legitimate users. This would 
cause a DoS attack that prevents authentic users (autonomous 
vehicles) from being able to communicate with each other or 
with the whole infrastructure. Furthermore, an attacker can 
achieve a DoS attack by generating a high volume of false 
messages which flood the network impeding the performance 
of any decision-making processes of the autonomous vehicle. 
An attacker can compromise the communication network and 
change the content of a warning message or send fake 
messages to other vehicles to disrupt the smooth road 
functionality or cause accidents. For example, an attacker 
who receives a warning message “Road Constructions 
Warning” from a nearby vehicle can change the content of 
the message and send the message “Road is clear” instead. 
Also, an attacker can compromise the confidentiality of 
autonomous vehicles’ operations by eavesdropping. An 
example of this attack could be the collection of location and 
routing information of specific autonomous vehicles in order 
to further harm the passengers in these vehicles or even steal 
the vehicles. Due to the fact that the exchanged messages are 
encrypted, this attack would require decrypting the 
exchanged messages to be successful. 
   The above scenarios lead to great damage to the 
autonomous vehicle communication system due to the bulk 
amount of data being sent. In network protocol attack, the 
attacker analyses the protocols to find out the weak points that 
can be exploited. Some researchers showed that CAN and 
FlexRay protocols are most vulnerable to this type of attacks. 
Rogue Updates attack occurs when the software of Electronic 
Control Units (ECU) are updated by versions not from the 
automakers (manufacturer). The Control Area Network 
(CAN) bus has limited number of bits (64 bits) dedicated to 
message transmission. This limitation does not allow strong 
encryption of messages and the authentication of these 
messages and their senders. Therefore, it is vulnerable to such 
attacks and other types of attacks as specified below. FlexRay 
protocol is based on both the Physical and Data Link layers. 
All the possible attacks on these two layers, including DoS, 
find their way to the FlexRay protocol.  For this protocol, 
only one node can produce the main signal while other nodes 
can only create idle signals. DoS will be achieved by 
continuously sending the main signal. 
   Modern vehicles have over fifty attack points (over 50 
generic attack points that hackers can exploit in order to 
attack a vehicle) including the in-vehicle systems (CAN, 
FlexRay, Ethernet communication protocol), the Mobile 
Network Operations (MNO) and the backend operations. Due 
to the additional technology that is introduced into 
autonomous vehicles, the number of attack points is 
increasing. At the same time, an increasing number of 
hacking tools, including software and hardware specifically 
designed to monitor and control the in-vehicle network, 
systems, and applications, are becoming available. Hacking 
tools can be used by researchers or hackers that are interested 
in exploiting the vehicle environment for their own benefits. 
Most of them are becoming open-source and are available for 
free. More importantly, the risk of a successful attack to an 
autonomous vehicle is dramatically increasing, since there is 
no fallback. Vehicle operations rely on technology and a 
potential compromise could have fatal consequences. 
   Attacks that result from increased connectivity of the 
autonomous vehicle are classified in to Physical Access 
Attack, Close-Proximity Attacks, and Remote Access 
Attacks.  
   Physical access attacks are categorized into Invasive and 
Noninvasive attacks [9] [34].  This classification is based on 
whether the attack is through device mounted on the 
autonomous vehicle or not. Invasive physical attacks are 
subdivided in turn into Side Channel Attacks, Clock Glitch 
Attacks, and Power Glitch Attacks [33]. Side Channel Attack 
occurs when the attacker builds up an alternative path for the 
data [9]. In Clock Glitch Attack, the signals from instruction 
sequence of the modules are inspected. The latter then is 
injected with fault signals resulting from exploiting timing 
violations [35]. Power Glitch Attack is done through 
analyzing the power consumptions of the electronic control 
units [36].  
   Invasive Physical attack exploits the weak points within the 
autonomous vehicle. Examples of such points are the 
Onboard Diagnostic Unit OBD and the media system [32]. 
All cars made after 1996 are required to have an Onboard 
Diagnostics Board connection (OBD-II) located within two 
feet of the steering wheel. All vehicles manufactured after 
2008 must share the same OBD-II protocol. The OBD-II’s 
initial function was to monitor mandated emissions 
equipment. Today, the port is used to monitor and control 
multiple functions. Service personnel plug equipment into 
this port for both diagnostics and ECU programming, 
typically via Windows-based computers, creating at least two 
paths for the introduction of malware. First, dealership 
computers typically connect to the Internet (often required by 
manufacturers) for daily code/firmware updates. During that 
process, malware could be downloaded and affect their 
computers. They in turn could spread the malware when they 
connect them to a vehicle’s OBD-II port. A second path is 
accomplished through hacking into the dealership’s wireless 
network. In addition to dealerships and mechanics, parents 
can connect an app to the OBD-II port to remotely monitor 
their children’s driving, and fleet managers use apps to keep 
track on how their fleet vehicles are being driven. These are 
further sources of attacks through the OBD-II protocol. Not 
only hackers intend on introducing malware, but clever 
thieves can access the port to clone “smart keys” and simply 
drive away with a stolen car. Attackers exploit these 
vulnerabilities to have access to the internal communication 
buses. Both Onboard Diagnostic Unit and the media system 
are connected to the CAN bus in the autonomous vehicles [9]. 
These invasive attacks are classified into Code Modification 
Attacks, Code Injection Attack, Packet Sniffing, and In-
vehicle Spoofing [32]. Code modification attacks are 
characterized by modifying the codes transferred through 
CAN bus. Code Injection Attack works in a similar way by 
injecting harmful codes through CAN bus. Packet Sniffing is 
a passive attack that allows viewing transmitted data between 
modules for the purpose of collecting information.   In-
vehicle Spoofing is also a passive attack where in which 
42

VEHICULAR 2019 : The Eighth International Conference on Advances in Vehicular Systems, Technologies and Applications

attacker is masquerading or pretending to be another identity 
to modify data [9]. These are executed through mounted 
devices and exploits the internal communications.  
   Remote Access Attacks are represented by the ability of the 
attacker to control the vehicle remotely. They evolve as a 
result the expansion of wireless communications in the 
autonomous vehicle in addition to the growth of external 
interfaces including the smart cameras and Lidar.  They can 
be categorized as Malware Injection, Signal Spoofing, and 
Fault Injection Query Attacks [34]. Signal Spoofing attacks 
exploit the external communications. These include GPS 
spoofing in which the attacker broadcasts incorrect GPS data 
[9]. Malware Injection attacks can be considered as code 
injection 
attack 
through 
the 
external 
wireless 
communications. Here the data is injected through these 
connections. These can be successful through exploiting the 
external communications of the autonomous vehicle. 
V. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE SECURITY 
   Autonomous Vehicle Security can be ensured by using 
various strong encryption and authentication algorithms and 
techniques to minimize the attack surface. Designing security 
for a system follows a number of steps: determining the 
objective, assessing the sensitivity, estimating capabilities, 
and determining the control features [10]. Various security 
attacks on AV are illustrated in Figure 4. The security 
requirements for autonomous vehicle are as follows: 
authentication, 
data 
confidentiality, 
data 
integrity, 
authorization, privacy, and traceability (tracking the malicious 
entities) [10]. These are depicted in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 4. Security Attacks on AV 
  
 
Figure 5. Security Requirements for Data Transfer in AV 
    
   Note that all the attacks mentioned in Figure 4 can impact 
all levels of autonomous vehicle.  However, as the degree of 
automation increases (moving from lower level to higher 
level), the impact of these attacks becomes more severe.  
   Autonomous Vehicle (AV) defenses are classified into four 
categories; Active Defenses, Preventive Defenses, Passive 
Defenses and Collaborative Defenses [9] [34]. These are 
clarified in Figure 6. Preventive defense tends to stop the 
attack when it occurs by increasing the security measures. 
This type of defense includes authenticating the user and the 
in-vehicle device, securing the communications, and 
controlling the network traffic (through firewall). These are 
implemented to ensure data confidentiality through using 
symmetric and asymmetric encryption processes and 
enforcing message integrity through the use of Message 
Authentication Code (MAC) or hash techniques.  
   Active defenses can be done by continuously monitoring 
the security scales of the autonomous vehicle or by applying 
adaptive security. The latter is characterized by reconfiguring 
the attack targets and improving tactics to have better control 
when the attack occurs [9].  
   The autonomous vehicles can cooperate to empower their 
cybersecurity. In future autonomous vehicles, Vehicle To 
Internet of Things, V2IOT, will be introduced within the 
clouds to reduce communication channels. Hence, this will 
further enhance the security by making targeting autonomous 
vehicle harder for attackers [37]. This collaborative defense 
that occurs in collaboration with cloud services will be part 
of cloud computing.   
   Passive defenses are carried out to detect, respond to, and 
recover from a security attack once it occurs.  It can be 
summarized by finding ways to prevent malwares and code 
injection and modification techniques. Responding to these 
attacks to counteracting their impact is exercised using 
electronic or cyber capability, such as GPS anti-jamming 
device [38] or isolation. Isolation refers to detaching the 
autonomous vehicle from Inter-vehicle communication 
network to avoid harms to others.

   A number of European projects that are meant to enhance 
security techniques for the autonomous vehicle are ongoing. 
These 
include 
Secure 
Vehicle 
Communications 
(SEVECOM),  Secure Hardware Extension(SHE), and E-
safety Vehicle Intrusion Protected Applications (EVITA). 
SEVECOM 
works 
on 
enhancing 
the 
security 
of 
communications between autonomous vehicles. SHE aims at 
enhancing cryptographic processes to increase security [39]. 
   Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) is technique used 
for the Inter-vehicle communications. This can be protected 
against security threats regarding authentication and 
confidentiality due to the use of the digital signatures and 
private keys [40].  However, they still augment the possibility 
of vehicular botnets [31]. For this reason, researchers worked 
on improving the security for VANETs by verifying and 
certifying correctness of cryptographic authentication [41], 
analyzing messages sent by VANETs (in low level 
autonomous 
vehicles) 
[42]-[45], 
and 
analyzing 
trustworthiness of the sender [46]. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
   Vehicles were first introduced to provide transportation only 
for people. Through time and with the development of 
technology, vehicles were gaining more interest and are 
further improved. The goal of this improvement was to 
increase the security of people and this led to increased 
intelligence in data analysis within the vehicle itself. For this 
reason, autonomous vehicles were born. Nowadays, auto 
industry is capable of delivering level 3 autonomous vehicles. 
Some automakers are expecting full autonomous vehicle to be 
presented after couple years. Due to the increase usage of the 
communication networks within the autonomous vehicle, the 
vehicle is becoming more vulnerable to various security attack 
types. These attacks will have severe negative impact on the 
networks within the vehicle and could lead to disastrous 
incidents if attackers gain control over the autonomous 
vehicle. To overcome these attacks different defenses are 
combined with cybersecurity techniques. The purpose of these 
defenses 
is 
to 
ensure 
integrity, 
authenticity, 
and 
confidentiality of data transmitted within the autonomous 
vehicles. In particular, to prevent these attacks or at least 
minimize their impact, strong encryption and authentication 
need to be implemented. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), 
and honeypots or honeynets should be considered.  In parallel 
with these approaches, more smart sensors have to be 
introduced to replace the classical sensors.  This will allow for 
cryptographic capabilities within these sensors as computing 
capabilities will be included.
