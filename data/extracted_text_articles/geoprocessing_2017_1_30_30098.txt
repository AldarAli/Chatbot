Abstract — A damaged sewer pipe is considered a major cause 
of the occurrence of urban ground cave-ins. Identifying the 
sewer pipe characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of 
ground cave-ins can be highly helpful in detecting the damaged 
sewer pipes and preventing ground cave-ins. To achieve this aim, 
Student’s t-test and chi-square test were performed with all the 
sewer pipes in Seoul that included the ground cave-in 
occurrence and nonoccurrence cases.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Numerous ground cave-ins induced by a damaged sewer 
pipe have been reported from many urban areas in the U.S., 
Japan, and South Korea [1]-[3]. Japan National Institute for 
Land Infrastructure Management (JNILIM) reported that 
about 17,000 ground cave-ins occurred in Japan between 2006 
and 2009 [2]. In Seoul, 3,626 cases of ground cave-ins were 
reported between 2011 and 2015 [3]. Extensive inspection 
using a video camera robot and a ground penetrating radar 
(GPR) is required for detecting and replacing the ruptured 
sewer pipes to prevent ground cave-ins [4][5], but most of the 
big cities in the world run thousands of sewer pipes beneath 
the streets. Seoul, for example, runs 370,000 sewer pipes, with 
a total length of approximately 10,000 km [3]. The massive 
number of sewer pipes running beneath the streets makes their 
inspection practically impossible. For their efficient 
inspection, suspicious sewer pipes and the surrounding area 
that may induce ground cave-ins should be preferentially 
investigated. To achieve this aim, the sewer pipe 
characteristics that may contribute to the occurrence of ground 
cave-ins need to be determined. 
JNILIM and Davies et al., [2][6] investigated the 
relationship between the sewer pipe characteristics and the 
occurrence of ground cave-ins. The previous researches, 
however, considered only the ground cave-in occurrence 
cases and did not consider the ground cave-in nonoccurrence 
cases. But studies on nonoccurrence group, together with 
occurrence group, can also provide meaningful implication 
for ground cave-in occurrences. In this study, for the ground 
cave-in occurrence and nonoccurrence groups, comparative 
analysis (i.e., Student’s t-test, chi-square test) was performed. 
The statistical analysis including data acquisition and 
analysis method are laid out in section 2. Section 3 presents 
and discusses the statistical analysis results and section 4 
summarizes the contributions and conclusions of this study.   
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
The sewer pipe database built by the Seoul metropolitan 
government provides the characteristics of each of the sewer 
pipes buried in Seoul (221,242 cases). Using Google map, the 
addresses of the ground cave-ins obtained via the ground 
cave-in reports (968 cases) were converted to TM coordinates. 
With the coordinates of ground cave-ins and the sewer pipe 
database, damaged sewer pipes were identified and assigned 
to the ground cave-in occurrence group, and the remaining 
sewer pipes were assigned to the ground cave-in 
nonoccurrence group by using nearest sample tool in QGIS 
2.14.4. R, a language for data analysis was used to analyze the 
obtained data. Based on the previous researches, the sewer 
pipe characteristics that were to be tested for their contribution 
to the occurrence of ground cave-ins were chosen. 
For the continuous variables, six sewer pipe characteristics 
(i.e., length, average burial elevation, average burial depth, 
height difference between the two ends, equivalent radius of 
the cross-sectional area, and operating duration of the sewer 
pipe) were selected. Independent Student’s t-test with the null 
hypothesis “the means of the two groups are the same” was 
performed to determine if there was a significant difference 
between the mean of the ground cave-in occurrence group and 
that of the ground cave-in nonoccurrence group [7]. Applying 
Student’s t-test, a pooled two-sample t-test was performed 
when the assumption of homogeneity of variances was 
available, whereas an unpooled two-sample t-test was 
performed when the assumption was not available [8]. To 
assess the homogeneity of variances, the Levene test was 
performed [9]. 
For 
the 
categorical 
variables, 
two 
sewer 
pipe 
characteristics (i.e., cross-sectional shape and material of the 
sewer pipe) were selected. A chi-square test with the null 
hypothesis “the two categorical variables are independent” 
was performed to determine if the explanatory and response 
variables were independent [10]. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Table I summarizes the results of the analyses of the 
Levene test for the homogeneity of variances and of the 
Student’s t-test performed for the continuous variables. For 
the average burial elevation, average burial depth, and 
operating duration of the sewer pipes, which showed a less 
than 0.05 p-value in the Levene test (i.e., not available for 
homogeneity assumption), an unpooled two-sample t-test was 
performed. On the other hand, a pooled two-sample t-test was

performed for the length, height difference between the two 
ends, and equivalent radius of the cross-sectional area of the 
sewer pipes, which showed a higher than 0.05 p-value in the 
Levene test. The length, average burial elevation, average 
burial depth, and operating duration of the sewer pipes showed 
a far lower than 0.05 p-value in the t-test, which implies that 
there was a highly significant difference in mean between the 
ground cave-in occurrence and nonoccurrence groups. On the 
other hand, the height difference between the two ends and the 
equivalent radius of the cross-sectional area of the sewer pipes 
showed a higher than 0.05 p-value in the Student’s t-test, 
which implies that there was no significant difference in mean 
between the ground cave-in occurrence and nonoccurrence 
groups. Based on the results of the Student’s t-test and the 
mean values of the ground cave-in occurrence and 
nonoccurrence groups, it can be concluded that the 
susceptibility to the occurrence of ground cave-ins increases 
as the length and operating duration of the sewer pipe 
increases and as the average burial elevation and average 
burial depth of the sewer pipe decrease. 
Table II summarizes the results of the analysis of the chi-
square test results. The equivalent radius of the cross-sectional 
area of the sewer pipe, whose p-value was higher than 0.05, 
was independent of ground cave-in occurrence. On the other 
hand, the material of the sewer pipe was dependent on ground 
cave-in occurrence because its p-value was lower than 0.05. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
This study investigated the sewer pipe characteristics that 
contribute to the occurrence of ground cave-ins by performing 
Student’s t-test and a chi-square test on the ground cave-in 
occurrence and nonoccurrence groups. Based on the analysis 
results, the conclusions shown below were drawn. 
(a) In the case of the continuous variables, the length, 
average elevation, average burial depth, and operating 
duration of the sewer pipes showed significant differences in 
mean between the ground cave-in occurrence and 
nonoccurrence groups. In other words, there is evidence that 
longer or older pipes are damaged more often, which may 
have contributed to ground cave-in. Additionally, the pipes 
with lower burial depth and lower average elevation also 
induce ground cave-in more frequently.  
(b) In the case of the categorical variables, the material of 
the sewer pipe showed a significant correlation with ground 
cave-in occurrence, while pipe shape did not. 
Student’s t-test and chi-square test, however, have 
limitation that they only deal with mean difference 
independence. To find a specific correlation between the 
sewer pipe characteristic and the occurrence of ground cave-
ins, further research including regression analysis need to be 
performed.
