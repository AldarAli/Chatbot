Abstract—Long-term conditions in Scotland account for 80%
of all GP consultations; they also account for 60% of all deaths in
Scotland. Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) are common long-term respiratory diseases [1]. Asthma
is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic
airway inﬂammation. It is deﬁned by the history of respiratory
symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness
and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with
variable expiratory airﬂow limitation [2]. So far, we know that
there are many different things – such as viruses, allergens, and
pollution – that cause asthma or trigger attacks but not why or
how they do it. This paper outlines how an open source dataset
can be used to estimate asthma hospitalisation rates and uses
machine learning to predict these rates, within ±7.5%, and for
an 86.67% success rate.
I. INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of asthma continues to increase worldwide
(it affects 1-18% of the global population), although non-
communicable diseases such as Asthma are still not seen as a
health care priority in many countries despite their impact.
Asthma is a chronic inﬂammatory disease that presents as
a long-term condition with severity varying from person to
person. Globally, 300 million people are affected by asthma
on a daily basis [3]. In 2015, the UK had the highest number
of Asthma sufferers in Europe with 4.67 million people [4].
In the UK now, 1 in 11 people have asthma, including
1.1 million children and 4.3 million adults. Shockingly, ev-
ery 10 seconds, someone in the UK has a potentially life-
threatening asthma attack and each day three people in the
world die from asthma [5]. The landmark International Study
of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) and the
European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS)
studies demonstrated substantial national variations in asthma
prevalence, with evidence suggesting that the UK ranks as
being one of the countries with the highest prevalence in the
world [6]. Bringing these statistics down to a more regional
level, Scotland has one of the highest prevalence of asthma
in Europe with 9.51% of the population being affected by
the condition (554,306 people) [3]. It is also predicted that
by 2025, there will be almost 400 million asthma patients
worldwide.
Scotland provides a good test case in analysing health and
social care factors, especially where its local authorities and
health boards often face different challenges in regard to
health and well-being. While national statistics, such as SIMD
(Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) exist [7], they do not
give enough details on the factors which could inﬂuence a
more in-depth analysis of contributory factors. This paper thus
uses the publicly available data set from ScotPHO Proﬁles [8],
and uses this to train towards the best machine learning models
in order to predict the outcomes.
The methodology used in this paper to analyse asthma
hospitalisation rates are to take an open source data set with
a range of metrics and then:
• The metrics are correlated, using linear regression (with
the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient) against each other to
see signiﬁcant linkages.
• A machine is trained using 30% of the data and then to
predicts from hospitalisation for asthma. In this way, the
machine is being trained against three metrics within the
data in order to determine the most signiﬁcant factors in
the matching.
• Each of the models are then assessed for the complete
dataset, along with a success threshold. In this way,
a success band within +/-7.5% between the minimum
and maximum value is used. The top contenders for a
successful match are then outlined and checked for their
usefulness in showing contributory factors.
• Once all the models have been determined, the top ma-
chine learning models for the top 100 successful models
are then selected and the variables from each on the
most successful training models are then scored for their
success. Those metrics which appear most often within
the most successful models can then be deﬁned as the
most useful in predicting asthma hospitalisation rates.
II. FACTORS INFLUENCING ASTHMA PREVALENCE
A. Environmental factors
Despite the considerable genetic contribution, for example,
the presence of asthma and atopy in the family, most impor-
tantly the maternal history of asthma, there are likely to be
1

GLOBAL HEALTH 2018 : The Seventh International Conference on Global Health Challenges

several additional social and environmental factors involved
in the exacerbation of asthma [9]. With most of the world’s
population living in urban areas, the environmental conditions
whereby pollution continues to increase, have and will con-
tinue to have an inﬂuence on the rise in asthma prevalence. Air
pollution – whether it’s trafﬁc fumes, smoke or dust particles
– is an asthma trigger which is difﬁcult to avoid in city
environments. According to a survey carried out by Asthma
UK, two-thirds of people reported that poor air quality makes
their asthma worse.
B. Passive smoke
A study carried out to investigate the relationship between
air quality and school absences found that exposure to cigarette
smoke had a signiﬁcant impact on current wheeze, use of
services, and interference with physical activity. Among ado-
lescents, smoke exposure was found to be a more important
factor than deprivation in relation to symptoms, use of ser-
vices, and impact on activities [10]. Passive smoking is a major
global problem, causing 12,000 deaths each year in the UK and
causing 2% of the current annual total deaths. These ﬁgures
alone are enough to provide sufﬁcient evidence to promote the
prevention of passive smoking in the public domain [11].
C. Childhood obesity
It is also well documented that asthma presents its peak
incidence in childhood. In the US, the age group with the
highest percentage of persons with asthma from 2001 to
2015 was consistently age 5-14 years [4]. Obesity rates in
children have increased dramatically across most English-
speaking countries over the past decades and the impact on
obesity on health has become a major global burden.
D. Poverty and asthma
A retrospective study carried out in West Midlands (Eng-
land) to investigate the relationship between asthma admission
rates, routes of admission and socioeconomic deprivation
found that asthma admissions are strongly associated with
deprivation in the community [12]. Asthma admission rates
were higher in all age groups (except over 65s) for those
from poorer districts. The age group with the most signiﬁcant
relationship between asthma admission rates and Townsend
deprivation index was 0-4 years. Another study stipulates that
higher hospital admission rates of asthmatics who are poor or
belong to ethnic minorities may be due to the fact that these
groups rely mainly on crisis management of the condition,
[13] are under medicated [14], are under-users of primary care
facilities, lack a planned crisis management, live in adverse
environmental conditions in terms of asthma triggers such
as smoking and cockroach exposure, or are exposed more
frequently than other groups to psychosocial problems within
the family and their community [15].
E. Asthma in the elderly
Although asthma has a high burden in children, the relative
importance of asthma impact increases with old age and is
also particularly apparent in the elderly, especially in women.
Asthma reportedly affects 10% of the over 65 population who
in general have lower lung function and greater symptom
severity than young asthmatic patients. “late onset” asthma
is ﬁrst diagnosed after the age of 65 and is often a more
severe phenotype, with less symptom-free days, and a higher
requirement for oral corticosteroids [16].
III. METHODOLOGY
A. Open source data analysis
Population studies have been used within smoking and
alcohol studies for many decades, such as in 1939 when
Hermann Müller at Cologne Hospital in 1939 published his
work on the linkage between smoking and cancer [17], and
which was conﬁrmed by Eberhard Schairer and Eric Schöniger
[18]. Their work was then conﬁrmed in the 1950s by a number
of epidemiological studies, including Ernst Wynder and Evarts
Graham [19]. Doll and Hill conﬁrmed the effect by observing
that smokers of 35 or more cigarettes per day had a 40.6 times
increase in the odds of dying from lung cancer [20]. Since then
smoking has been increasingly pinpointed within a number of
ailments, including for COPD [21].
Smoking prevalence has also been studied and matched
to differing demographics. This includes with [22] where
researchers analysed 4,411 respondents aged 15 to 54 years
and found that the smoking rates for no mental illness was
22.5%, while those with a lifetime mental illness was 34.8%.
Along with this smoking is seen to be an increasing problem
with poverty [23], especially as those who are wealthy are
more likely to quit smoking than those in poverty [24].
B. Machine learning
In terms of asthma, machines learning is now playing an
increasing role in creating expert systems for diagnosis. [25]
used questionnaire data and clinical data to train a machine
learning methods and used Context sensitive auto-associative
memory neural network model (AMNN), a Backpropagation
(BP) model, the C4.5 algorithm, a Bayesian Network (BN),
and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). They found the
accuracy of the methods varied between 81.17% and 84.16%,
and that the accuracy of the AMNN and PSO methods were
the most accurate, along with having excellent learning and
diagnostic abilities.
[26] reviewed over ﬁve years of data and applied latent
class analysis to distinguish asthma and wheezing subtypes
in childhood. The data sets analysed included ALSPAC [27];
AMICS [28]; AMICS-Menorca [29]; CAPS [30]; CCCEH
[31]; DARC [32]; ECRHSII [33]; EGEA2 [34]; GINIplus
[35]; IoW; ISAAC phase II; Cohort; LISA; MAAS; MACS;
MAS; MCS; PARIS; PASTURE; PIAMA; PIPO; SLAM; and
WHEALS. Of the 34 data sets analysed, 16 included wheezing
and coughing, 10 included atopic status, eight included growth
patterns, and two included eczema. In the data sets, 22 related
to children and only two related to adults, with the rest deﬁned
as unspeciﬁed. The cohort size was typically between 20 and
66.

In [36], the authors used a machine learning approach to
analyse the pattern of IgE response (over time or to speciﬁc
allergens) in order to identify atopic vulnerabilities related
to the presence of asthma. They used data from the skin
and IgE tests from childhood onwards and clustered the
population into multiple atopic classes using unsupervised
learning. These were trained against asthma-related data, such
as for symptoms, hospitalizations, lung function and airway
reactivity. Their results indicate four main classes: Multiple
Early (10.6%); Multiple Late (16.2%); Dust Mite (4.5%); and
Non-dust Mite (9.5%), along with a ﬁfth class of No Latent
Vulnerability (59.2%). The association for asthma was most
strong for Multiple Early class, and which also showed a
considerable link to lung function and airway reactivity. Along
with this the work identiﬁed a highly signiﬁcant increase in
the risk of hospital admissions for wheeze/asthma after three
years old, but only among children in the Multiple Early class.
IV. RESULTS
The results use a publicly available data set from ScotPHO
Proﬁles [8], and where 56 metrics are used to train against (as
outlined in Table III) and using the local authority region as
the index value. If we select three variables to train against,
one variable we will have 26,235 triplets to test, while four
variables will give us 341,055 machine learning assessments
(Table II). A benchmark of the time to check a model and to
match against predicted values gives an estimated time of 0.4
seconds. Table II thus outlines estimations for orders of run
times. As we see the total run time for four variables is fairly
large and costly in computation time, while two variables are
not likely to give us enough variation in the variables in the
models, thus this paper uses three variables to train against.
While we can apply linear regression to the data, there are
often complex interrelationships that need to be analysed with
machine learning. In the evaluation, the data was analysed
using the Python RandomForestRegressor method, using a
success rate of ±7.5% for asthma hospitalisation rates. In each
case, 30% of the data is taken to train the machine model, and
then all of the data is used to test for success.
Table I outlines patients hospitalised with asthma for local
authority areas within Scotland. In terms of correlation with
hospitalised due to asthma, Table IV provides the strong
correlation factors which were greater than a magnitude of
0.5 from within the dataset. This shows that COPD, smok-
ing, and metrics related to those hospitalised over 65 were
the strongest in correlation. There are thus generally strong
positive correlations with COPD, but a negative correlation
between male and female life expectancy.
In Table V, we see the results of running random forest
linear regression against patients hospitalised with asthma
against three other metrics. The determination of success
in predicting the hospitalisation rate is deﬁned as ±7.5%.
The best success level is 86.67%, and which had eight best
solutions (Table VI shows one of the best models). One of
these is New cancer registrations, People aged 65+ with high
care needs cared at home, and Children in Poverty. If we
now analyse the Top 100 models from machine learning, we
generate Table III. In this way, we see that Patients with
emergency hospitalisation appear within 71.7% of the top
models, and is a strong predictor for estimating hospitialisation
rates for asthma.

V. CONCLUSIONS
Increasingly open source data can be used to make pre-
dictions based on populations, and this paper shows that key
metrics in predicting asthma rates, such as COPD, smoking
rates and emergency hospitalisation rates. Within machine
learning, a key factor is deﬁning the required training features
within a model. This paper has outlined some of the key
features which could be used to predict asthma hospitalisation
rates from open source data, and the ones which can be
ignored.
