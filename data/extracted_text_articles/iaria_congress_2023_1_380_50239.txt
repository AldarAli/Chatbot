Abstract—In this paper, a wireless system in the presence of α-
µ fading is analyzed. Also, there is Co-Channel Interference 
(CCI), i.e., crosstalk from two different radio transmitters 
using the same frequency channel. The CCI has the same 
distribution as the fading in the observed environment. To 
mitigate these adverse effects, a diversity receiver with 
Selection Combining (SC) is used. For such wireless system 
configuration, we calculated the Average Bit Error Probability 
(ABEP) based on the Moment Generating Function (MGF). 
Analytical results are presented graphically in order to 
highlight the influence of fading and CCI parameters. 
Keywords- α-µ fading; Average Bit Error Probability 
(ABEP); Co-Channel Interference (CCI); Moment Generating 
Function (MGF); Selection Combining (SC). 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
One of the most critical disruptions to signal propagation 
in wireless channels is fading. A fading channel is a wireless 
communication channel that experiences fading [1]. Fading 
is modeled as a random variable with a certain statistical 
distribution. It is very important that this distribution 
describes the conditions in the wireless channel as closely as 
possible.  
Recently, a lot of work has been done on the research of 
different distributions that satisfy these conditions. Thus, the 
α-µ distribution is introduced as a small-scale fading model. 
This model includes the nonlinearity of the propagation 
medium since the assumption of a homogeneous diffuse 
scattering field is only an approximation [2]. Actually, this is 
generalized Gamma distribution that encompasses some 
other distributions. Among them are: Gamma, with Erlang as 
its discrete versions and central Chi-squared, then Nakagami-
m with its discrete version- Chi distribution, and also 
Weibull, Rayleigh, exponential, and One-sided Gaussian 
distributions. Therefore, α-µ distribution is suitable for a 
comprehensive analysis of the performance of wireless 
systems in the presence of the listed types of fading by 
reducing to special cases for certain values of parameters α 
and µ. 
In addition to [2], there are not many papers in the 
literature considering this type of fading, despite its 
convenience. Nevertheless, we will mention some of them 
[3]-[8]. The authors in [3] evaluated the Moment Generating 
Function (MGF) for the Probability Density Function (PDF) 
that describes the -µ wireless fading channel. The derived 
expression for MGF was utilized in obtaining the Bit Error 
Rate (BER) for different modulation techniques over this 
channel. An expression for the outage probability was also 
derived in the closed form. Both expressions can be reduced 
as special cases to those earlier obtained in the literature for 
known fading channel distributions such as Rayleigh, 
Nakagami-m, and Weibull. 
The same authors worked with this fading even further, 
and in [4] they derived expressions for the amount of fading 
and the average channel capacity for this channel model. 
They confirmed once again the generality of this fading 
model as they reduced the expressions for the obtained 
performance metrics to other expressions for other channel 
models as special cases. 
In [5], the authors proposed a novel MGF for α-μ fading 
distribution valid for all values of parameter α, as 
modification of the MGF from [3], where the MGF was valid 
only for non-integer values of α. Then, the closed-form 
expressions of BER for different modulation techniques such 
as Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK), Binary Frequency 
Shift 
Keying 
(BFSK), 
 
Differential 
Quadrature 
PSF (DQPSK), Binary Differential PSK (BDPSK), and M-
ary PSK (MPSK) over α-μ fading channels are determined. 
In [6], the exact PDF of the square ratio of two 
multivariate 
exponentially 
correlated 
α-µ 
distributed 
variables is derived. Then, the expressions in the closed form 
are determined for the Cumulative Distribution Function 
(CDF) and PDF of the maximal and minimal square ratio of 
two multivariate exponentially correlated variables. These 
formulae are the base for Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) 
based analysis of Selection Combining (SC) receiver through 
communication systems. 
An enriched α − μ distribution which may act as fading 
model is analyzed in [7]. The complex α-μ fading channel is

observed in [8] with an Orthogonal Frequency-Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM) application. 
The Co-Channel Interference (CCI) can occur in wireless 
systems beside fading. The most common reasons causing 
CCI are: bad weather condition and bad frequency planning. 
Its influence must be studied along with the influence of 
fading. In this paper, we performed a MGF-based calculation 
of the Average Bit Error Probability (ABEP) in an α-µ 
fading and CCI environment when SC diversity receiver was 
used to mitigate the influences of these disturbances. As far 
as we know, the derivation the MGF for the defined scenario 
has not been reported in the open literature. 
Here, we choose discuss MGFs since, beside other 
reasons, they are useful in analysis of sums of Random 
Variables (RVs). Namely, the MGF of RV gives all moments 
of this RV, which is a fact that gives the name to the moment 
generating function. Second, the MGF (if it exists) uniquely 
determines the distribution. This means, if two RVs have the 
same MGF, then they must have the same distribution. Thus, 
if the MGF of an RV is found, its distribution is determined. 
Our paper consists of four sections. After the 
introduction, in Section II, the SIR-based performance 
analysis at the output of SC receiver in the presence of α-µ 
fading and CCI is presented. In Section III, some graphs 
highlighting the parameters influence are plotted. At the end, 
a conclusion part is given. Finally, we conclude the paper in 
Section IV. 
II. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS BASED ON THE SIR AT THE 
OUTPUT OF THE RECEIVER 
In this section, we will derive the performance of a 
wireless system in the presence of α-µ fading and CCI. To 
mitigate the effects of fading and CCI, a SC diversity 
receiver with L branches, shown in Figure 1, is used. The SC 
receiver transmits to the user the signal from the input 
antenna whose value is the highest.  
The input signals are xi, i=1, 2, …, L; L   2. The output 
signal is x. The CCI envelopes at the input are yi, i=1, 2, …, 
L with output value y. We will derive the Signal-to-CCI ratio 
(SIR)-based system performance.

So, the input ratios of the useful signals and the CCIs are 
zi.=xi/ yi, and the output SIR is denoted by z.

In SC, the received signal from the antenna that 
experiences the highest SIR (i.e., the strongest signal from L 
received signals) is chosen to be processed in the receiver 
(see Figure 1). Thus, the SIR z at the output of SC receiver 
with L branches is the maximum SIR of all the received 
signals:

B. Moment Generating Function 
The complicated PDF expression often limits the 
evaluation of performance measures of generalized fading 
channel models. The MGF is an important statistical function 
for each distribution. In the theory of probability and 
statistics, the MGF of a real RV is an alternate feature of its 
PDF.

C. Average Bit Error Probability 
The ABEP is among the performance that best describe 
the nature of the system's behavior, and that is why it is 
most often used to describe that behavior. So, determining 
the ABEP in the simplest possible way is of great 
importance. In reality, the difficulty in evaluating the ABEP 
is that the conditional BEP is a nonlinear function of the 
SNR or SIR. The nonlinearity is a consequence of the

modulation/detection scheme. This is the reason for 
considering the MGF-based approach to determine ABEP. 
Using the MGF-based approach, the ABEP for two 
modulations will be determined very efficiently, without 
numerical integrations. By utilizing the expression for MGF 
from (17), the ABEP for non-coherent BFSK and BDPSK 
modulations will be [1]:  
be
0
z
P (
 )=0.5M (0.5)
,    for BFSK,       (18) 
be
0
z
  P (
 )=0.5M (1)
,     for BDPSK.       (19) 
III. PERFORMANCE RESULTS 
To examine the influence of fading and CCI severity on 
the ABEP, numerically obtained results are illustrated in the 
next two subsections. In the first subsection, the case of 
BFSK modulation is observed, and in the second one, the 
case of BDPSK modulation is shown. We used the programs 
Origin and Mathematica to plot graphs.  
A. Binary Frequency Shift Keying Modulation  
In Figures 2 and 3, we present the curves for ABEP 
versus SIR w= Ω/s at the output of the SC receiver with L 
branches, in the case when BFSK modulation was used. In 
these figures, we changed the values for one group of 
parameters, and kept the values for the other parameters.  
So, in Figure 2, the ABEP is presented for BFSK 
modulation and dual branch SC receiver (L=2), with µ2=1, 
while parameters α and µ1 are changing. One can see from 
Figure 2 that the ABEP grows with an increasing in 
parameter α. This means that system performance gets 
worse. When the parameter µ1 increases, the ABEP 
decreases and the system has better performance.

Figure 3.  ABEP versus SIR for BFSK modulation with variable 
parameters µ2 and L. 
In Figure 3, the ABEP is plotted versus SIR for BFSK 
modulation with variable parameters µ2 and L. In this figure, 
the parameters whose values are retained are: =1, and 
µ1=1, while parameters L and µ2 are changing. From Figure 
3, we can see that the increase in the parameter µ2 has no 
effect on the ABEP, while with the increase in the number 
of branches L, the ABEP decreases significantly and the 
system has better performance. 
B. Binary Differential Phase-Shift Keying Modulation 
In Figures 4 and 5, the curves for ABEP versus SIR at the 
output of SC receiver with L branches are presented for 
BDPSK modulation. Figure 4 shows graphs for dual branch 
SC receiver (L=2). In this figure, µ2=1 and parameters α and 
µ1 took several values.

Figure 5.  ABEP versus SIR for BDPSK modulation and variable 
parameters µ2 and L. 
It is visible from this figure that the ABEP grows when the 
parameter α increases. This spoils the system performance. 
When the parameter µ1 increases, the ABEP decreases, 
improving the system performance. 
In Figure 5, the ABEP is presented versus SIR for the 
BDPSK modulation with parameters µ2 and L that are 
changing. In this figure, the parameters whose values are 
retained are: =1, µ1=1. From Figure 5, one can conclude 
that the increase in the parameter µ2 is without significant 
impact on the ABEP, while with the increase in the number 
of branches L, the ABEP drops significantly. This leads to an 
improvement of the system performance and is in 
accordance with theoretical assumptions. 
Comparing the results from these two figures, we can 
conclude that the system has better performance with smaller 
ABEP in the case of using BDPSK than BFSK modulation. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION  
In this work, a wireless system in an α-µ fading and CCI 
environment 
is 
analyzed. 
To 
improve 
the 
system 
performance by mitigating these harmful effects of CCI 
interference, SC diversity receiver is employed. The MGF-
based ABEP is obtained for BFSK and BDPSK modulation 
types. The analytical results are presented graphically and 
the influence of parameters of fading and CCI is highlighted. 
Based on them, we concluded that in α-µ environments, it is 
more advantageous to use BDPSK than BFSK modulation. 
One of the main contributions of our paper is that it can 
be used to determine the ABEP of wireless systems in the 
presence of other types of fading, namely for Rayleigh, 
Nakagami-m, Weibull, and One-sided Gaussian, in the 
presence of CCI, by setting certain values for parameters α 
and µ. 
In our future work, we will consider correlated α-µ 
channels, since correlation between the faded channels also 
affects the PDF of SIR at the output of the SC or some other 
diversity system.
