 INTRODUCTION  
In the last few decades very precise static force 
measurements were developed and are now routinely used 
for calibration services in many national metrology 
institutes (NMI’s) around the world. The force scale which 
is covered nowadays reaches from µN-MN [1-2]. Thereby, 
relative measurement uncertainties down to 2·10-5 are 
obtained using deadweight machines, which are the best 
standard to realize a traceable force. The force, F, is just the 
product of the SI base unit mass, m, and the gravitational 
acceleration, g, following Newton’s law, F=m·a, with the 
acceleration, a=g.   
Besides the precise realization of a force in a standard 
machine, there must be selected force transducer available 
which can be used as a transfer standard to give the primary 
calibration to the secondarily calibration laboratories and 
industry. The crucial fact is now that often these static 
calibrated 
force 
transducers 
are 
used 
in 
dynamic 
applications. That is the reason why more and more NMI’s 
have established procedures for a dynamic calibration of 
force transducers and also other sensors. 
Currently in the European Metrology Research Programme 
(EMRP) one promoted research topic is the: “Traceable 
Dynamic Measurement of Mechanical Quantities”, which 
includes, apart from a work package about dynamic force, 
also work packages about dynamic pressure, dynamic 
torque, the electrical 
characterization of measuring 
amplifiers and mathematical and statistical methods and 
modelling [3]. 
Similar to the static calibration philosophy primary 
calibrations have to be provided which guarantee 
traceability to the SI base units and also transfer transducers 
(reference standards) to transfer these calibrations e.g. to an 
industrial application. This transfer turned out to be the most 
complicated task because of the crucial influence of 
environmental conditions present in certain applications. 
Mostly the transducers are clamped from both sides which 
lead to sensitivity losses due to the dynamics of these 
connections which are more or less not infinitely stiff. On 
the other hand the resonant frequency often shifts down to 
lower frequencies which can also drastically change the 
sensitivity. The problem can be solved to a certain extent by 
modelling the whole construction including all relevant 
parameters. For that reason it is also important to determine 
the force transducer parameters like stiffness and damping 
which can be obtained during a dynamic calibration. This 
article describes one possibility for a primary dynamic force 
calibration using 
sinusoidal 
excitations. The whole 
procedure as well as most of the set-ups where developed 
over two decades and are extensively described in [4]. Other 
methods as well as analysis procedures for dynamic force 
calibration are described in [5-9].

MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION  
To obtain an analytical “handle” for the description of the 
dynamic behaviour of a dynamically excited force 
transducer, the well-known spring-mass-damper model can 
be applied. In figure 1 one can see a simplified picture of a 
force transducer which is equipped with a test mass, mt. The 
connection of that mass to the transducer is modelled by a 
certain stiffness, kc, and a damping constant, bc. The 
transducer itself consists of a bottom mass, mb, and a head 
mass, mi. Both masses are also connected by a spring with 
stiffness, kf, and a corresponding dumping constant, bf. The 
coordinates in space of all three masses are then given by 
the vector (xt, xi, xb), if only a vertical movement is 
considered. A periodical force acts from the bottom on the 
mass, mb, (see Fig.1). This force is generated by an 
electrodynamic shaker system. The acceleration of the top 
mass, 
tx&& , the acceleration on the shaker table, 
bx&& , and the 
force transducer electrical signal are measured during the 
calibration procedure. This transducer signal is directly 
proportional to the material tension/compression and can be 
described in the model by the difference of the spring 
coordinates xi-xb .  
The system depicted in figure 1 can be finally modelled by 
the following system of linear differential equations with 
constant coefficients:  
 
 
Figure 1. Schematic model of a force transducer equipped with a top mass. 
The transducer itself can be seen as a spring-mass-damper, which consists 
of two masses connected by a spring. The adaptation of the test mass is also 
modelled by a damped spring, whose stiffness is mostly much stronger than 
that of the transducer.

It should be noted that the system can be simplified if the 
coupling of the top mass has practically no influence on the 
dynamic process. This would correspond to the special case, 
kc  ∞ , bc  0, and the top mass as well as the head mass 
of the transducer can be summarized as one mass body. In 
the calibration process the dynamic sensitivity, which is the 
ratio between the measured force transducer signal and the 
acting dynamic force, is measured as follows.

In equation 2 the reduced mass µ=(mt·mi)/(mt+mi) was 
introduced. This equation can be drastically simplified if the 
top mass coupling is neglected and one applies a Taylor 
series development of the second order for the frequency ω:

This equation is very convenient for fitting purposes to 
approximate the measured sensitivities just by the two 
parameters, p1 and p2.   
The measured sensitivity is calculated from the ratio of the 
transducer signal, Uf, and the acting dynamic force:

The parameter, Kcorr, takes into account the vertical 
acceleration gradient over the mass body. Finite element 
simulations have shown that the individual mass points of 
the mass body have slightly different accelerations in the 
vertical direction [4].  This correction factor can be 
neglected, if quite small masses are used (only a few

obtained for the limiting case ω=0, whereby p=p1. As one 
can see from approximation (4), the sensitivity drops down 
quadratically with increasing the frequency ω. 
Besides the amplitude of the sensitivity according to 
equation (4), also the phase shift between the acceleration xt 
and the force signal Uf can be derived by the model:

The quite complicated equation (5) contains functions f1-f3 
which are all proportional to 1/kc , so that these terms can be 
neglected for the limiting case of infinite coupling stiffness 
of the top mass.  In addition the arcus-tangent function can 
be approximated by a Taylor series of the first order for the 
frequency ω, which leads to a linear phase shift between the 
acceleration- and force transducer signal. 
 
 
III. 
MEASUREMENT SET-UP  
 
The essential prerequisites for a primary sinusoidal force 
calibration are seen in figure 2. First of all one needs an 
exciter. At PTB we have three electromagnetic shaker 
systems, a small one for forces up to 100 N and 10 Hz until 
2 kHz, a medium one up to 800 N for 10 Hz till 3 kHz and a 
large shaker up to forces of 10 kN and frequencies of 10 Hz 
to 2 kHz. The shakers consist of two parts, the vibration 
exciter itself and a power amplifier. The kind of excitation is 
determined by the chosen signal created by a function 
generator. This signal directly modulates the current signal 
which drives the coil of the shaker armature.The 
acceleration of the top mass can be measured principally in 
two different ways, either by a primary method using a laser 
Doppler vibrometer or by accelerometers.  
Usually the vibrometer is used, which consists of a laser 
head providing a 632.8 nm red laser beam and a certain 
controller. There are two kinds of laser heads, one with a 
fixed beam and the other one with a scanning opportunity. 
The scanning vibrometer is able to scan surfaces in an angle 
region of ±25º in the x- and y- directions. This offers the  
 
Figure 2. Schematic measurement set-up for the sinusoidal force calibration 
 
possibility to investigate surface vibrations. The modular 
controller consists of different digital processing units, two 
velocity decoders, a displacement decoder and a digital 
quadrature decoder. In summary a frequency range from 0-
2.5 MHz with a maximum velocity of 10 m/s and a 
resolution of 0.02 µm/s can be realized. The signal 
processing inside the decoders is fully digital, the output is 
provided as an analogue signal. For precise calibrations the 
digital quadrature encoder is used in connection with certain 
software which calculates the displacement according to the 
arcus-tangent procedure. The analogue IQ output signals are 
bundled together with the transducer output signal and the 
acceleration signal from the shaker armature in a junction 
box which is then cabled to a 5 MHz PC sampling card.  
 
IV. 
TRACEABILITY AND UNCERTAINTY CONSIDERATION 
 
The sinusoidal calibration of force transducers is a primary 
calibration method which means that all measured quantities 
are traceable to the SI base units and all measuring 
equipment used is calibrated using certain standards, which 
are well established procedures. The calibration of the 
weights used as top masses is done according to the 
international recommendation OIML R 111-1 [10]. 
According to this document the top masses can be classified 
at least as Class M1, which leads to a maximum error for a 1 
kg weight of 50 mg or a relative standard measurement 
uncertainty of 5·10-5.  Apart from the mass determination, 
the acceleration measurement is the most important part of 
the calibration. In figure 3 the traceability chains are shown 
for different ways

Figure 3. The traceability chains of the acceleration measurement are 
shown for a primary and secondary method. Left hand side shows the 
primary method using laser interferometers/vibrometers, the right hand side

of acceleration measurement. There are, in principle, two 
ways, the primary method using interferometers/vibrometers 
and the secondary method based on a certain electrical 
chain.  The vibrometer measurement can differ according to 
the involved overlap of certain laser beams in the homodyne 
or heterodyne interferometers. Both instruments are based 
on 
modified 
Mach-Zehnder 
interferometers. 
In 
the 
heterodyne interferometer, the measuring laser beam is 
spitted whereby one part is additionally mixed with a high 
frequency using a Bragg cell, usually 40 MHz, to provide 
the Doppler encoding. The homodyne interferometers are 
used for larger displacements which can be determined by 
counting the interference maxima, which is also known as 
the fringe counting method. The displacement is, thereby, 
only a function of the laser wave length and the number of 
fringes. Fringe counting can be performed with very precise 
instruments, like the high performance counter Fluke 
PM6681. According to the fringe counting equation, see 
figure 3, the uncertainty is very small. The relative counting 
error of the Fluke counter is at 1 kHz, ∆Counts/Counts 
≈5·10-8 and the relative wavelength error is in the order of 
∆λ/λ≈10-6. The main error is made if the displacement 
comes in the order of λ/2, because this is the resolution limit 
of the fringe counting. Keeping in mind a lower limit for the 
displacement of 400 µm, one can obtain uncertainties of 
0.1% in the range from 10 Hz to 1.5 kHz.  
As mentioned above, the heterodyne technique is based on 
the arcus-tangent calculation of the quadrature signal. If one 
plots the IQ measuring points in a 2 dimensional grid, as 
seen in figure 3, one obtains a circle in the most perfect 
case. The fully digital quadrature encoding avoids all errors 
made in former times by analogue filters and mixing 
devices.  By default the whole electrical chain of the 
vibrometer controller is calibrated by the manufacturer 
through coupling of very precise known artificial 
displacement signals directly in the controller. These 
measurements result in uncertainties which are below 0.1% 
[11]. On the other hand, the vibrometer used for the 
sinusoidal force calibration was calibrated against the 
national acceleration standard. Thereby, the acceleration 
values obtained by the measuring program had deviations 
from the standard set-up of 0.02-0.04%. With a clear 
conscience one can obtain an uncertainty at least of 0.1% for 
the frequency range of 10Hz-1.5 kHz with the heterodyne 
method. 
The right-hand side of figure 3 shows the conventional 
method of acceleration measurement using accelerometers 
in combination with certain conditioning amplifiers.  
Normally a charge amplifier is used which can be calibrated 
with a very precise reference capacity and a high accurate 
voltmeter. The relative standard measurement uncertainty of 
both devices is a few 10-4 % according to the calibration 
certificate which was obtained by a standard calibration 
procedure at PTB. For the use in a calibration set-up, one 
has to consider the whole measuring chain consisting of the 
accelerometer and its conditioning amplifier. The measuring 
chain can be included by a calibrated sensitivity factor, Sqa, 
which commonly has an uncertainty around 0.2 %, as 
illustrated by example in figure 3. According to the charge 
amplifier calibration for the accelerometer measuring chain 
also the force transducer can be handled, if a piezoelectric 
transducer is used. 
For the case of transducers based on the strain gage 
technique, a special calibration device, also called bridge 
standard, was developed [4]. The bridge standard simulates, 
in principle, a force transducer and is based on a Wheatstone 
bridge whose bridge voltage is, as in the real case, provided 
by the amplifier. In place of a force transducer the bridge 
standard is connected to the conditioning amplifier. The 
output to the amplifier is a dynamic bridge detuning which 
can be steered through an analogue input signal from an 
arbitrary function generator with voltage amplitudes. Inside 
the device the input signal is transformed to a mV voltage. 
The signal which is seen from the amplifier can be 
measured in addition on an auxiliary output channel.  
The total (combined) measurement uncertainty, uc, of the 
sinusoidal calibration can then be separated into two main 
parts, a set-up dependent part, us and a part which is 
obtained by the actual calibration measurement, um:

The part, us, is, in principle, a constant given for a certain 
set up and reflects the smallest achievable measurement 
uncertainty. This part depends - according to equation 4 on 
three parts, the uncertainty of the acceleration measurement, 
the uncertainty of the conditioning amplifier calibration and 
the uncertainty of the mass determination. Note that the

Figure 4.  There is shown an example of the standard uncertainty 
evaluation, us, of the dynamic sensitivity at a frequency of 400 Hz. The 
calculation was done according the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty 
in measurement”, GUM [12]. 
 
uncertainty of the head mass, mi, of the transducer is not 
included in this part, because this mass has to be determined 
with the aid of the actual measurement. According to the  
numbers for the certain uncertainties given  above, this part  
results in an uncertainty contribution of 0.1-0.25 %.  Figure 
4 shows as an example the uncertainty evaluation for us 
which is obtained at 400 Hz. 
The part, um, includes the uncertainty of the internal mass 
determination and depends further mainly on the standard 
deviations of the performed measured sensitivity points. By 
using the scanning vibrometer for the acceleration 
measurement on the top mass one can measure up to 100 
points, depending on the actual geometry of the weight. 
Through this opportunity special disturbing influences like 
rocking modes or mechanical adaptation influences of the 
transducer can be taken into account. It should be noted that 
these influences contribute more than other errors made, by 
e.g., the sine approximation of the measured data or the 
uncertainties caused by special filter techniques applied in 
the analysis procedure. 
Experience has shown that the uncertainty part, um, is on 
average below 1 kHz between 0.4-1% and above 1 kHz 
around 1-2%.  
 
 
V. 
MEASUREMENT EXAMPLE  
 
Figure 5 illustrates the output of a special calibration. In this 
case a 25 kN force transducer based on the strain gage 
technique was measured with five top masses as seen in the 
upper panel of figure 4. As seen from the sensitivity plot, all 
masses are in good agreement below a frequency of 1 kHz.  
 
Figure 5: Dynamic sensitivity, upper panel, of a 25 kN strain gage force 
transducer measured by five top masses. The lower panel shows the un-
certainties of the individual measuring points.  
 
This is also confirmed by the combined relative standard 
measurement uncertainty, given in %, which can be seen in 
the the lower panel of figure 5. The different top masses 
cause different resonance frequencies which lay in the range 
of 700-1400 Hz. Measuring points near the resonance and 
also beyond naturally have a bigger uncertainty. 
To acquire a figure of merit, all the sensitivity curves 
obtained with the different top masses can be fitted with a 
function according to equation 4 and the mean value for the 
obtained parameters can be calculated. Including the 
uncertainties of the individual points in the fit procedure 
moreover, leads to a realistic error also for the fit 
parameters. The averaged fit results, together with the 
obtained uncertainty range are shown in figure 6. The 
sensitivity at frequency, f=0, was scaled to 100 % to 
illustrate the sensitivity drop as a function of frequency in 
an easy readable way. Thus, it can immediately be seen, that 
the transducer shows only 96% of its sensitivity at 1.6 kHz.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The traceable sinusoidal calibration of force transducers was 
demonstrated. The calibration mainly depends on the 
acceleration measurement and the calibration of the 
electrical chain of the conditioning amplifiers used. For the 
most accurate acceleration measurement, laser Doppler 
vibrometers can be used which are traced back to the laser 
wavelength. In the case of piezoelectric force transducers 
the   charge amplifiers can be very precisely calibrated using 
a reference capacity and a primary calibrated multimeter. 
For strain gage transducers, a special calibration bridge 
standard was developed to dynamically calibrate voltage 
ratios.  
In chapter IV it was shown that one can perform the 
calibration depending on the involved top masses with 
relative standard measurement uncertainties of ≈0.4-2.0%. 
The main uncertainty contributions are not caused by the 
set-up but rather by the mechanical influences like 
adaptations and the rocking modes of the transducer. These 
disturbing influences can be detected during a calibration 
measurement by applying additional sensors like, e.g., 
triaxial accelerometers.  If a certain threshold of transverse 
acceleration is exceeded, e.g., caused by rocking modes or 
side resonances of the transducer, the corresponding data 
will be no further considered.  In addition special adapters 
can be developed to suppress these effects.
