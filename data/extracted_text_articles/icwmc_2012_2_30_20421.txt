Abstract—This paper presents a semi-passive universal, multi- 
applications, SMART RFID Sensing Transponder (SRST). It 
consists of a new low-power passive 13.56MHz RFID Analogue 
Front End (AFE), a micro-controller, sensors and rechargeable 
battery. The AFE was designed and fabricated successfully based 
on using a 0.35um CMOS technology. To allow re-charging a 
battery through the RF field, a new RF energy harvesting system 
is designed and integrated within the AFE; this leads to a self-
powered system, which is a new benefit in the RFID sensing and 
continuous monitoring.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology has 
been widely used in the past few years as it helps identify 
objects and people in a fast, accurate and inexpensive way. It 
is used into many areas, including product tracing, 
transportation payment, animal identification, as well as 
passports, etc. [1].  
RFID systems are comprised of three main components: 
the tag or transponder, the reader or transceiver that reads and 
writes data to a transponder, and in some applications, the 
computer containing database and information management 
software. 
RFID tags can be active, passive, or semi-passive. The 
communication of active RFID is powered by its own battery 
which 
enables 
higher 
signal 
strength 
and 
extended 
communication range of up to 100 m. But the implementation 
of active communication requires larger batteries and more 
electronic components leading to higher costs. Passive and 
semi-passive RFID send their data by reflection or modulation 
of the electromagnetic field that was emitted by the Reader. 
The typical reading range is between 10cm and 3m. 
In recent years, RFID has been introduced in sensing 
applications and semi-passive RFID tags are mainly used for 
such applications. The battery of semi-passive RFID is only 
used to power the sensor and recording logic. New 
developments have provided solutions for temperature 
monitoring, but RFID for sensing applications is still limited 
to sensing and storing the temperature and fulfilling the 
functionality of data logger [2][3]. Semi-passive RFID loggers 
offer an economical solution for the spatial profiling of 
transports with a high number of loggers. 
Data loggers are standard tools for the supervision of cool 
chains. In order to handle the data for a high number of 
temperature records, the measurements have to be processed 
locally. It is not feasible to transmit full temperature data by a 
reader at unloading of a truck or container [4][5].  
 
The shelf life prediction system is an example of 
application where huge data have to be processed locally. The 
system used to monitor the changes in quality of perishable 
foods during the transport phase and record them [5][6]. When 
addressed, the system delivers the prediction of the remaining 
shelf life time based on the used keeping quality model which 
uses the Arrhenius’ Law, saying that, all reaction rate 
constants are assumed to depend on temperature [7][8]. 
 
An intelligent RFID sensing transponder has to measure 
the ambient parameters, process the information locally and 
transmits only the important information. Currently, there is 
no RFID transponder with a freely programmable processor. 
Indeed, the available RFID transponders do not allow the 
development of new applications because their protocols are 
already frozen by the chip logic core. 
 
In this paper, a SMART RFID Sensing Transponder 
system is presented. It includes a new passive RFID chip and a 
platform which allows the following: 
 
 A freely programmable processor for the development 
of new applications 
 Cost-effective to facilitate the deployment 
 The system allows storing the history of the measured 
environmental condition data (Temperature, Humidity, 
etc.) 
 Layered HW/Firmware/SW system structure which 
allows a modular structure. The transponder provides 
an easy update and offers the possibility to extend 
application domains  
 
Energy consumption of the transponder system has been 
minimized to a high extent by appropriate design and system 
control.

In addition, a Smart energy harvesting has been developed 
to ensure energy autonomy and to allow sensing and 
continuous monitoring. These represent radical progress in 
RFID sensing applications. 
 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
describe the proposed transponder system. In Section III, we 
present the transponder power consumption analysis. Section 
IV presents the designed Analogue Front End chip. Section V 
discusses the AFE experimental results. Finally, we present a 
conclusion of the work in Section IV.

RFID SENSING TRANSPONDER SYSTEM 
 
The transponder system (SRST) is a semi-passive element. 
Figure 1 shows the general architecture of the tag which is 
designed with the minimum electronics components and 
optimized to achieve a low current consumption during 
operating period. The tag is composed of a new passive RFID 
Analogue Front End (AFE) chip, a micro-controller, 
EEPROM and sensors.

The component list used in the proposed sensing 
transponder is summarized in Table I. A microcontroller is 
used to develop applications and process data provided by 
sensors and stored in an EEPROM. Thanks to the new AFE 
intended mainly to the communication and energy scavenging, 
the SRST allows freely programmable processor for the 
development of new applications.

To add sensors to the tag, a microcontroller becomes 
necessary for the analysis of the measured values. The 
processor module calculates and stores the resulting values 
into a programmable memory EEPROM. The stored data are 
sent when receiving a “data-log” command from the reader. 
The RFID AFE Chip transmits the stored data over the RF 
Field to the reader. In addition, the RFID tag sends a real time 
sensor measures. In this case, the microcontroller sends the 
measured values of the sensors, after a conversion, directly to 
the RFID chip. For the programming of the micro-controller 
and the development of a new application, a JTAG (Joint Test 
Action Group) interface is added.  
  
III. 
TRANSPONDER OPTIMIZED POWER CONSUMATION 
CONSIDERATION 
 
The transponder system is optimized for low-power 
dissipation in order to extend the battery life, which allows the 
condition monitoring during the transport for instance. After 
the good shipment, a new battery charging cycle is started to 
prepare the transponders for a new shipment.

component of the transponder.

Extending the battery lifetime requires an efficient use of 
the transponder components which must then be turned off 
when not required. This is what is called the duty-cycling, i.e. 
the sensor is active during a short period and goes to the 
standby mode when its sensing information are sent and or 
stored in the EEPROM. The EEPROM is switched to the 
standby mode after a write cycle.

operating steps of the transponder during one sampling period.

example, if a measurement period is set to 10mn, a battery 
with a capacity of 1mAh can been used for about 20 days 
before starting a new battery charging cycle. A small battery 
capacity is selected to get a thin form factor for the overall 
transponder.

The AFE includes the following blocks: 
A. Power Supply 
The on chip power supply is extracted from the exciting 
field using an AC/DC converter. To avoid over-voltages in 
high magnetic fields the DC-voltage is clamped. The buffered 
Supply Voltage passes via a regulator. The output of the 
regulator is used to power the major part of the analogue front 
end. 
The conventional rectifier is a diode bridge rectifier. The 
structure of bridge rectifier and its MOS construction are 
shown in Figure 7.

In the MOS transistors bridge rectifier, the voltage drops 
are related to the threshold voltage and also the overload

To reduce the output voltage drop, the bridge rectifier 
structure shown in Figure 8 is used. In this structure, the output 
voltage drop is reduced from two threshold voltages to one 
threshold voltage. 
In Figure 8, NMOS MN1 and MN2 are diode-connected

structure. L1 and L2 are the input differential signal, when L1 
is high, L2 is low, MN1 and MN3 transistors are turn-on, 
MN2 and MN4 transistors are turn-off and the rectifier has one 
VGS drop. The opposite operation occurs when L1 is low and 
L2 is high.

B. Power On Reset  
The Power-On-Reset (POR) circuit monitors the regulated 
voltage Vdd and generates a global reset-signal putting the chip 
into an appropriate initial state at power up. It also will 
guarantee that the chip ceases operating when the supply 
voltage falls below level necessary for reliable operation. 
Hysteresis system is provided to avoid improper operation at 
the limit level  
C. Modulator 
The Modulator will modulate the continuous wave RF 
signal coming from the reader by changing the Q-factor of the 
tuned circuit by means of an extra resistive load connected in 
parallel with the resonance capacitor Cr. These changes in the 
Q factor induce a corresponding signal in the reader coil. 
 
D. Clock Extractor 
The clock extractor generates a system clock with the 
frequency of the RF field. The output signal of this Clock 
Extractor is passed via a Frequency divider and will then 
define the on-chip timings.  
E. Data-Extractor  
The data extractor demodulates the incoming signal to 
generate logic levels and decodes the incoming data. 
In the ISO 15693 standard, communication between the reader 
and the tag takes place using the modulation principle of 
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK). Two modulation indexes are 
used, 10% and 100%. The tag shall decode both. The reader 
determines which index is used. Data transmission type from 
tag to reader employs load modulation. When 100% ASK is 
selected, there is the discontinuousness in the energy of 
electromagnetism 
field 
because 
of 
characteristics 
of 
modulation type. When 10% ASK is selected, the transmission 
of energy of electromagnetism field is continuous.  
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the incoming signal and the 
extracted data in 10% and 100% modulation receptively.

F. Micro-controller interface 
This block allows setting the appropriate voltage levels for 
the data coming in and out of the AFE. 
G. RF Energy harvesting 
The important feature of the proposed system is the re-use 
feature thanks to the battery charger block which will allow re-
charging the battery through the RF field.  
The battery charger has been designed to allow the 
charging of a Micro-Energy Cell (MEC®), which is a solid-
state, rechargeable thin-film battery. MECs are manufactured 
by Infinite Power Solutions using wide area thin-film 
deposition techniques similar to those used to manufacture 
semiconductors [9]. The MECs enjoy the advantages of rapid 
recharge and charge acceptance at currents as low as 1uA. 
 
Figure 11shows the block diagram of the battery charger. It 
consists of a battery current charger and a voltage sensing 
blocks.  
The battery supply (Vdc) is obtained by rectifying the 
power carrier of the wireless link.  
The battery current charger consists of reference current 
and current sources.  
The voltage sensing block senses the battery voltage and 
generates 
the 
end-of-charge 
signal 
(Charge) 
so 
the 
microcontroller will set the Enable (uc_EN) low to stop the 
battery charging.  
The selection of the current charge level and the battery 
end-of-charge is done by a trimming method. The trimming 
circuit was chosen by means of a binary weighted switch 
network with 11 bits resolution.

AFE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
The proposed AFE has been designed and fabricated 
successfully using a 0.35um CMOS technology as shown in 
Figure 12. The overall circuit is 1635um by 1640um.  
Before the layout release, every function module of the 
AFE has been verified by SPICE simulations and by 
considering the variation of Process, Voltage and Temperature 
(PVT).  
The measured total current consumption of 6uA has been 
achieved in active mode. The AFE chip operates within a 
temperature range of -40 to 95°C and a supply range (Vdc) of 
3-5 V. 
A summary of the chip characterization is presented in this 
section.

A. Reader-Transponder communication 
The SMART RFID Sensing Transponder communication 
platform is fully compliant with the standard protocol 
ISO15693 [10].  
Custom commands for sensing and monitoring have been 
also developed and implemented. 
Figure 13 is showing an example of communication. The 
reader sends Inventory request Double Sub-carrier, High Data-
rate. The data are extracted for the RF field by the AFE (top 
trace). The transponder responds through the AFE (bottom 
trace) by sending its UID.

B. RF enrergy harvesting 
To evaluate the battery charger, a capacitor of 100uF was 
used. The limit test cases are shown below: 
 
a) Case 1 
The battery voltage is set to the minimum level of 3.0V 
with the trimming bits 1 to 8 at low state. The charging current 
is minimum by setting the trimming bit 9 to 11 to low state 
(Figure 15). 
 
 
Figure 15: Case 1, All trimming bits are set to low state.  
TRIM<1:8>= Low, TRIM<9:11>= Low Battery voltage = 3.0V,  
Charge Time: 580ms 
 
b) Case 2 
The battery voltage is set to the maximum level of 4.1V 
with the trimming bits 1 to 8 at high state. The charging 
current is increased by setting the trimming bit 9 to 11 to high 
state (Figure 16).  
 
 
Figure 16: Case 1, All trimming bits are set to high state.  
TRIM<1:8>= High, TRIM<9:11>= High, Battery voltage = 4.1V,  
Charge Time: 384ms 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a novel RFID sensing technology that is 
validated in a Smart, Self-powered, Low-cost and Re-usable 
transponder system was presented. A batteryless RFID 
Analogue Front End has been described. The chip was 
fabricated in a 0.35m CMOS process. The re-use and 
continuous features are allowed thanks to the designed RF 
energy 
harvesting 
system. 
In 
addition, 
low-power 
consumption has been achieved by optimizing circuit design 
and technology.  
The power consumption of the used sensors is still high. In 
future, to further reduce the overall power consumption, low-
power temperature and humidity sensors will be designed and 
integrated within the AFE.
