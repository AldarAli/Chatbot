Abstract—Japan is a representative super-aging society in the
world. Generally, the quality of life is closely related with the
elderly’s mobility or accessibility to the necessary facilities in
daily life. Therefore, how to ensure the sustainability of the
elderly’s mobility has been a very important issue. In our
previous study, we found that driving a car play a very
important role in this context. On the other hand, the smart
transportation
system
represented
by
Advanced
Driver
Assistance System (ADAS) including Advanced Emergency
Braking System (AEBS) is expected to make car driving for the
elderly safe and sustainable. This paper uses the data collected
in Japan to show that the AEBS is very effective to ensure safe
driving for the elderly. Thus, a smart mobility society can be
expected in the coming years.

INTRODUCTION
Japan is well-known as a super-aging society in the
world.
To make this super-aging society sustainable, the
countermeasures securing mobility and accessibility of
elderly people have been discussed for a long time not only
in Japan but also in the world. Generally, a sustainable public
transportation system is considered to be the best solution.
However, it is very difficult to achieve this goal successfully.
For example, in the Chukyo metropolitan area of Japan
where the central city is Nagoya, from 2001 to 2011 (refer to
[1]), the number of elderly people being 65 years old and
over increased from 1.5 million to 2.0 million (about 1.4
times). Although the public transportation services have been
promoted with some incentives for the elderly people, the
rail system uses only increased from 158 thousand to 199
thousand (about 1.26 times) and the bus users even
decreased from 89 thousand to 88 thousand (0.99 times). In
contrast, the automobile users increased from 1.25 million to
2.46 million (about 2.0 times).
Regarding the automobile use of the elderly people, the
Japanese government has released the analysis reports many
times on the traffic accidents (for example [2]). The fatalities
in 24 hours caused by traffic accidents in Japan have been
reduced to 3904 persons in 2016 from 6415 persons in 2006.
However, the elderly rate is increased from 44.3% in 2006 to
54.8% in 2016. Although we know that the major reason is
that the percentage of the elderly people is increasing, more
effective countermeasures are required.
As a good solution, autonomous vehicles are rapidly
becoming the focus of attention to ensure the accessibility
need of all people in the future (such as [3]). However, we
should know that there is quite a long way to realize the fully
autonomous vehicles society from now ([4] et al.). Therefore,
the most important issue goes to how to ensure the safety
when the elderly people drive cars by themselves. Here, the
safety includes the drivers themselves and the other people.
In the world automobile market, the reality is at the stage
of vehicle with Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS).
And this stage may be considered as a primary stage of the
autonomous vehicles society. According to RnR Market
Research [5], most major ADAS technologies are attracting
less than 10% penetration rates in 2015. However, the
penetration rate of the car rear view camera has been kept on
a level being higher than 30% since 2014 in Japan. That is,
Japan is one of countries with the highest ADAS penetration
rates in the world with respect to the automobile sales.
Because the ADAS can be thought as a compensation of the
physical and mental disability for the elderly drivers, the
diffusion of the ADAS may help to reduce the traffic
accidents to some extent.
Regarding the effects of ADAS, many previous studies
have been implemented worldwide. Davidse [6] denoted that
ADAS would extend the older adult's safe mobility as a
driver. Winter et al. [7] concluded that Adaptive Cruise
Control (ACC) and Highly Automated Driving (HAD)
reduce the driving workload and improve the completion of
in-vehicle tasks. The research results by Cicchino [8] showed
that
Forward
Collision
Warning
(FCW),
low-speed
Autonomous
Emergency
Braking
(AEB)
and
their
combination reduces front-to-rear crash rates by 27%, 43%
and 50%, respectively. The study by Son et al. [9] found that
age and gender groups affect the performance of in-vehicle
technology. In Italy [10], the beeping ADAS was reported
having disturbed driving and distract drivers as the negative
effect. Again, regarding the negative effects, the study
conducted by researchers in the Netherlands [11] tells us that
drivers equipped with ADAS cross intersections more often

with a critical time-to-collision (TTC). In Canada, the
research focused on the comparison between older and
younger drivers [12], concluding that advanced in-vehicle
signs
may
increase
the
frequencies
of
stopping
at
intersections with relatively short yellow onsets for both
younger and older drivers. As a study regarding aftermarket
Collision Avoidance Technology (CAT), a research report
[13] was compiled on the basis of surveys in the United
States of America (USA). The effectiveness of the lane
departure warning system (LDWS) was 76% and that of the
FCW was 74.5%.
Taking into account the above background, we report an
analysis using the traffic accident data collected in Japan. In
this paper, our analysis focuses on the effects of the ADAS
for safe mobility, especially with respect to the elderly.
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section II briefly describes the methodology; Section III
provides the detailed analysis and results discussion; Section
IV gives the conclusion and brings up some suggestions for
future research.

METHODOLOGY
As shown in Figure 1 reported by Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism [14], the penetration
rates of some representative ADAS applications in Japan are
depicted by Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS),
Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS), LDWS and ACC.
Among these representative ADAS applications, according
to the research report published by TTRI [15], the AEBS is
the most popular function, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore,
the AEBS is set to be the representative ADAS equipment to
be evaluated in this paper.

In Japan, among all automobile manufacturers, Subaru is
the pioneer and introduced the AEBS (named Eyesight) into
the vehicle market in 2008. The Eyesight was upgraded
twice in the following years, and the updated version 3
released in 2014 has included the ACC, the LDWS and some
more functions. We take the AEBS as the target function in
this paper by considering that the AEBS is the basic function
and has been in market for many years. This long term
enables us to collect necessary data to evaluate the effects. In
2015, the percentage of all sold Subaru cars having Eyesight
was 83% in the Japan market, as shown in Table 1.
Comparing the percentages given in Figure 1, this number
was much higher than the average level in Japan. This
enables us to evaluate the AEBS by comparing the traffic
accidents numbers and rates caused by the Subaru cars and
the others. Then, a simulating analysis for the future to
secure the safe mobility is given as the conclusion.
III.
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The analysis and discussion can be divided into three
steps: A. a general understanding on the possibilities of the
ADAS; B. the effects of the ADAS for the elderly drivers;
and C. the expected effects to reduce the traffic accident
fatalities and the solution for the mobility or the accessibility
of the elderly people.
A.
General Understanding
Figure 3 is the first comparison between the traffic
accidents rate of the newly registered Subaru cars and that
caused by other newly registered cars in Japan. Here, the
traffic accidents data is the data of all traffic accidents with
injuries and it was purchased from the Institute for Traffic
Accident Research and Data Analysis (ITARTA) that is
entitled to have all traffic accidents data collected in Japan.
The
traffic
accident
rates
are
based
on
the
newly
sold/registered vehicles which are collected from Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc. [17]. From this
figure, it is easily understood that the traffic accidents by the
newly registered Subaru cars were 1.20 times comparing to
other newly registered cars around 2008, but decreased since
2009 and have been only 0.6 times recently. The reason this
rate has been flat is because it was also more popular for
other cars to be equipped with AEBS starting in 2014, as
shown in Figure 1.
In Japan, similarly to the other countries in the world,
young drivers under 25 years and elderly drivers 65 years
and older are normally considered to be associated with
traffic accidents more than other drivers. To analyze the
problem, we corrected the traffic accidents occurred in Japan
(data source: [18]) and we are showing the results in Figure
4. A comparison between the Subaru cars and other cars is
made by the age group, as shown in Figure 5. Here, four age
groups are compared. Compared to the traffic accidents in

2008, the traffic accidents by the Subaru cars decreased
remarkably since 2012. In contrast, a remarkable decrease of
the traffic accidents by other cars starts from 2015. Among
the four age groups, the elderly drivers including “64-74”
and “75 and older” have shown a steeper decreases
compared to young drivers “under 25” and “25-64” years of
age.

B.
Effects for Elderly Drivers
Regarding the elderly drivers, at first, the effects are
compared by the extent of the injury caused by the traffic
accidents. As seen in Figure 6, the number of fatal accidents
by Subaru cars during the period from 2012 through 2016 is
about one-fifth compared to 2008, although there are some
irregular changes over the years. Furthermore, by comparing
this with the number of fatal accidents by other cars, the
noticeable difference during the period from 2012 through
2015 clearly tells us that how much the AEBS contributed to
this outcome. Moreover, the 2016 results of both the Subaru
cars and others let us know that the AEBS effects are
common with all ADAS equipped cars.

Figure 7 summarizes the comparison results by traffic
accident classification. Here, P2V stands for “person-to-
vehicle”, V2V expresses “vehicle-to-vehicle” and “V only”
means “vehicle-to-infrastructure” or vehicle alone. From
Figure 7, we can know that “vehicle only” accidents with
injuries by Subaru cars have been reduced drastically since
2014 when the Eyesight Version 3 was released. Meanwhile,
V2V accidents have been reduced in average. Similar results
can be seen with other cars in 2016. These results may
indicate that the AEBS help the vehicle to recognize large
objects
such
as
infrastructures
and
cars
ahead
more
effectively than the appearance of pedestrians. However, the
effects with the “P2V” accidents are becoming conspicuous
when many automobile manufacturers equipped the AEBS
and other ADAS equipment in 2016.

accident classification, considering a value of 1.00 in 2008 (top: Subaru
cars; bottom: other cars)
For traffic crash types, the comparison results are
depicted in Figure 8. Although there are some irregular
movements during 2009 through 2011 for Subaru cars, the
remarkable and stable decreasing trends can be seen from
2012 for Subaru cars and from 2014 for other cars. In 2016,
all types of traffic accidents have been reduced to less than
40% of those from 2008. Among these crash types, rear end,
head-on and crossing crashes have been reduced much more
than left turn or right turn crash.

crash type, considering a value of 1.00 in 2008 (top: Subaru cars; bottom:
other cars)
Furthermore, the comparison is focused on weather.
Figure 9 summarizes changes of the traffic accidents under
different weather conditions. Because there is not enough
data for Subaru cars in the foggy days, the change of the
traffic accidents cannot be expressed here. In addition, a
violent fluctuation with the traffic accidents in the snowy
days by Subaru cars can be observed. The same can be
observed with the traffic accidents in the foggy days by other
cars. Therefore,
we
only want
to
conclude
that
the
remarkable decreases have been achieved in either the sunny
days or the rainy days from Figure 9. Similar to the above
analysis, the positive results obtained from 2012 for Subaru
cars and from 2014 for other cars support the explanation
that these effects are consistent with the diffusion of the
AEBS.
Lastly, the comparison is made based on the road
environment. The comparison results are shown in Figure
10. As there are some violent fluctuations with “others”, our
discussions
are
only
focusing
on
road
sections
and
intersections. Although the traffic accidents reduction effects
are well functional with both road sections and intersections,
the effects with road sections seem more obvious than that
with intersections in average.

C.
Expected Effects in the Coming Years
If we consider the AEBS is an innovative product, its
diffusion process can be discussed using the method
proposed by Rogers [19]. As it is shown in Figure 11, the
AEBS is getting into the “early majority” period in Japan as
the diffusion rate is 16% in 2015 (Figure 1). Then, in the
Tenth Fundamental Traffic Safety Program of Japan [20]
released by Cabinet Office in 2016, the Japanese government
emphasized that it is very important to utilize the innovative
technology to reduce the number of fatalities due to traffic
accidents. Therefore, it is expected that the number of AEBS
users may increase rapidly in the coming years.
As mentioned in Section 1, in Japan, the 24-hour traffic
fatalities (dead within 24 hours due to traffic accidents) were
3,904 persons in 2016. The goal set by the government is
less than 2,500 per year around by 2020. As one important
countermeasure, the AEBS and other ADAS equipment will
be
functional
to
ensure
the
universal
mobility
and
accessibility.

IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, several comparative analyses on the effects
of the ADAS represented by the AEBS equipment are
implemented. These analyses revealed an important finding.
The ADAS equipment is really effective for the drivers,
especially elderly drivers, to reduce traffic accidents. As a
result, cars equipped with ADAS equipment might be
considered as a smart solution to realize the universal
mobility and accessibility of the elderly people in the super-
aging society.
As the future work, the following issues will be taken
into consideration: 1) the question whether there is an
incompatibility with some ADAS equipment, since many
different types of equipment are existing in the car market; 2)
the question whether drivers should be forced to purchase the
ADAS equipment; 3) another similar comparison analysis
extended to other countries.
