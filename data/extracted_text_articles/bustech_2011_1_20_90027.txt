I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The rapid development of Business Intelligence (BI) 
systems requires elicitation of enterprise management 
experience as knowledge and using it for development of 
Intelligent Information Systems [1]. It is important to 
develop an adequate business model that matches the 
organization's management information interactions. 
The enterprise modeling for information systems (IS) 
engineering is aimed at to describing the scope of the 
organization's management activities – knowledge and data 
transformations 
in 
enterprise 
management 
systems. 
Enterprise model is required to improve the company's 
performance, 
describing 
the 
operational 
sequences, 
responsibilities and relationships as well as to identify must 
systems that duplicate each other or are otherwise 
inappropriate [2]. 
 
Even though enterprise models are different, they all 
serve the purpose of developing enterprise models and 
methods, which could be used for the IS development as 
knowledge-based integration of data mining, online 
analytical processing (OLAP). Using such models it is 
easier 
to 
understand 
enterprise 
process, 
enterprise 
knowledge and structure, and to improve the enterprise 
efficiency. 
Enterprise models for information systems engineering 
are developed using DFD, ARIS, UML, IDEF3, IDEF0 
notations [2,8,9,10]; especially, BPMN and UEML 
notations are effective for enterprise modeling.  
 
It is important to identify the enterprise management 
knowledge which can be useful to improve enterprise 
efficiency, to help user and to manage data mining process.  
There are two types of models for IS engineering: a) 
enterprise models that describe empirical information about 
domain and b) enterprise management models that verify 
empirical information against formal theories or predefined 
structures [3]. Empirical enterprise models as well as 
enterprise management models can be developed using all 
previously mentioned business process modeling notations. 
A specific characteristic of the Enterprise management 
models is that they are based on obligatory information 
relationships of enterprise components. For instance, they 
form a feedback loop between the components of managed 
process and enterprise management function.  
Information need of enterprise activities depend on the 
certain patterns of enterprise management process, identified 
in the Enterprise management model [4]. The knowledge-
based approach to IS development is based on the Enterprise 
Meta-model [4] and co-relates with knowledge modeling and 
discovered of enterprise knowledge components. Types of 
enterprise model components and their interactions are 
defined in Enterprise Meta-model [4]. Therefore, an 
Enterprise Meta-model component could be used for 
acquisition of enterprise knowledge components.  
These principles of enterprise management modeling 
could be used for improvement data mining process. 
Reasonable selection of a data mining method and an 
algorithm is important to successful implementation of the 
process of analysis and the final result of data mining.  
Enterprise and enterprise management models are 
composed of components, which will be regarded as sources 
of enterprise knowledge.  
On the basis of knowledge-based engineering principles it 
is essential to identify the enterprise's knowledge 
components that are involved in enterprise management. 
This paper analyses EMM, ARIS, UEML, BPMN 
enterprise modeling methods and identifies knowledge-based 
components [2,8,9,10]. A control view-based approach to 
identification of knowledge components and their integration 
to data mining process are presented in the paper.

The paper structured into 3 parts. First, Enterprise 
knowledge and data mining integration are defined. Second, 
Knowledge-based 
analysis 
of 
Enterprise 
modeling 
methodology is described. Third, Enterprise knowledge 
model’s integration into data mining is analyzed. 
II. 
ENTERPRISE KNOWLEDGE AND DATA MINING  
Data mining is an iterative process of searching in large 
amounts of data or in large data repositories for hidden, 
previously unknown and potentially useful information, 
knowledge, a set of patterns and relationships between data. 
Data mining is a process (based on the CRISP-DM model) 
composed of consistent set of six stages [5]: Business 
understanding, Data understanding, Data preparation, 
Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment. 
These six data mining stages construct a single cycle of 
process. In order to gain better data mining results, data 
mining 
process 
could 
be 
aligned 
with 
Enterprise 
management modeling [6]. We propose to integrate the 
knowledge base in a data mining process, on the basis of 
which the data mining process could be controlled. 
The component of Enterprise management model could 
be used in data mining such as Enterprise knowledge held 
by an expert. Its use can develop a more rational data 
mining queries. We propose to use the Knowledge base in 
which Enterprise management knowledge would be 
collected. More accurate and structurally interesting 
information can be extracted from Knowledge base by 
adding business rules, knowledge of experience about 
management functions. 
Knowledge-based management model (Figure 1) is 
being established according to this principle: Enterprise 
management is structured as interactions of Management 
functions and Enterprise processes [6]. This Knowledge-
based management model illustrates the interaction between 
Enterprise processes (Pj) and Management functions (Fi), 
which serves for the Knowledge–based Enterprise's 
information system. The model (Fi x Pj) consists of 
Enterprise's information system, Management functions 
(F1xFi), Business goals (G), Enterprise processes (P1xPj).

The influence of Enterprise Goals to Enterprise 
management function is critically important as the final 
result of management depends on the Enterprise Goals.

Enterprise management is a model identifying Enterprise 
components, components of Enterprise management (Data, 
Knowledge, Goals) and their interactions [6]. “EMC 
(Elementary Management Cycles) is formalized description 
of the interaction of Process and Function – as two core 
components of Enterprise from the control point of 
view”[7]. 
Application of this model is important because this 
model describes the essential elements of Enterprise 
management and control function and their interactions. 
Besides, information flows are identified (Figure 2). The 
model reflects the interaction of management function and 
Enterprise process in which the elementary management 
activities (Interpretation, Data processing, Decision making, 
Realization of decision) compose a cycle– an Elementary 
Management Cycle (EMC).

KNOWLEDGE-BASED ANALYSIS OF ENTERPRISE 
MODELING METHODOLOGY 
This section provides the analysis of UEML, ARIS, 
BPMN and EMM enterprise modeling methodologies and 
languages from the aspect of knowledge. Components of 
structure of an enterprise model are described and 
knowledge components of a certain method are identified.  
A. UEML Enterprise modeling language 
Unified Enterprise Modeling Language (UEML) is a 
language of Enterprise processes' modeling, which is aimed 
at facilitating the integration of different modeling 
languages in a company [8]. UEML model stores Enterprise 
knowledge that is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4.  The major components of the UEML 
Figure 4 shows the composition of components of the 
UEML model: process, activity, actor, function, event, time, 
role, object, input and output. Function is defined as a 
component, which consists of processes and interactions of 
activities (including feedback loop). At the Knowledge base, 
each component stores a certain attribute or value that 
identifies it. The structure of UEML model can be described 
by these constructs:  
UEML= {Process, Activity, Actor, Function, Event, 
Role, Enterprise Object (Product, Order, Resourse)} 
B. ARIS Enterprise modeling methodology 
Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) - 
method of Enterprise modeling [9]. The main concepts of 
ARIS are a) the architecture for describing business 
processes; b) modeling tools for Event-Driven Process; c) 
comprehensive 
computer-aided 
Business 
process 
management. 
This 
methodology 
includes 
design, 
implementation, optimization and controlling of Business 
process. The uniqueness of this methodology is modeling 
from the control view point. Figure 6 shows a hierarchical 
structure of components of the ARIS method, in which 
constituent parts of the method are reflected.

C. BPMN Enterprise modeling notation 
Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) is a 
notation for the formation of business processes’ flow 
models (Figure 6). It is coordinated by Object Management 
Group (OMG) standards' organization that focuses on 
improving 
business 
processes. 
The 
basis 
of 
this  
methodology is the possibility for representatives of 
different fields of business  to understand business processes 
that take place in an organization and to reveal them in a  
single modeling notation [11]. Composition of BPMN 
model can be described by constructs that are presented in 
Figure 6:

D. Enterprise Meta-model 
EMM is a model of managed processes based on the 
structure of Elementary management cycle (EMC) that can 
be used for Knowledge-based systems modeling [4].  The 
main principle of this model’s structure is the evaluation of 
an aspect of Enterprise’s management by modeling 
informational interactions of Enterprise processes and 
Enterprise management functions. 
The control view-based approach to Enterprise modeling 
results in the Enterprise Meta-model (EMM)[4]. The EMM 
model is a formal description of the Enterprise management 
knowledge, in which major types of Enterprise components, 
their types of interactions are reflected (Figure 7).

demonstrates what knowledge elements are identified by 
each Enterprise modeling method. Each component 
expresses an aspect of Enterprise knowledge, which can be 
accumulated in the Knowledge base and developed on the 
basis of such an EMM. It indicates which Enterprise model 
accumulates more knowledge of the organization. A 
comparative analysis shows that Enterprise Meta-model 
(EMM) accumulates more knowledge components about the 
activities of the organization (Figure 7) as it models 
Enterprise management function in detail because of the 
control-view approach [4].

Table 1 lists the components of different Enterprise 
modeling approaches, indicates Enterprise knowledge 
components and attributes. After the analysis of the models 
and their constituent components we may presume that the 
EMM 
model 
retains 
more 
Enterprise 
knowledge 
components that are needed in order to enhance the IT based 
organization's management functions. 
IV. 
ENTERPRISE KNOWLEDGE MODEL'S INTEGRATION 
INTO DATA MINING 
Enterprise knowledge model is a model of information 
management processes, identifying Enterprise components 
and 
their 
interactions, 
components 
of 
Enterprise 
management (data, knowledge, goals) and their interactions 
[6]. Application of this model for the development of a 
Knowledge-based information system is important because 
it reflects the essential elements of the model and their 
interactions and displays information flows (Figure 5). The 
element of knowledge management is important in this 
model. Adding certain rules, knowledge of experience to 
functions performed by process, more accurate and 
structurally interesting information can be extracted from 
data sets. 
Figure 8 represents a diagram of entities' connections of 
Enterprise management model, which consists of the 
following 
components: 
Process, 
Function, 
Goals, 
Interpretation rules, Realization rules, Decision making 
rules, Data processing rules and Interactions between them. 
This is a transformed diagram of Enterprise Meta-models 
defined in Figures 2 and 3, the aim of which is to show the 
interfaces of Enterprise knowledge with process and 
function.

Figure 8.  Enterprise Knowledge-based model - Entity relationships 
diagram (Gudas S., 2004) 
In particular, Enterprise model helps to define and 
optimize processes in a company. Sequence of events, their 
interactivity, responsibility and data sources are clearly 
defined in the model. The composed Enterprise model 
allows the user to clearly imagine the data mining process 
and to adapt it to their own company easily and efficiently. 
Components of knowledge that can be expressed in a 
form of Enterprise rules are accumulated in Knowledge 
base. In this base, rules are stored independently from 
software code, thus, ensuring the flexibility of a system and 
the opportunity to quickly adapt the functionality of the 
system under the changed conditions, but without changing 
the software code. Template of Enterprise rules can be 
expressed as follows:  
IF <Variable><Condition><Value> THEN 
<Variable><Condition><Value> 
Figure 9 depicts mapping of the structure of Enterprise 
Meta-model into data mining process. Data mining process 
consists of several stages: creation of an OLAP cube, which 
will be used for data analysis; making a cube scheme; 
creation of a new data mining model; creation of additional 
fields, columns for implementation of a data mining 
algorithm; implementation of data mining process [11]. The 
table “Enterprise Meta-model” (Figure 9) provides 
knowledge components of Enterprise Meta-model that can 
11

monitors its implementation. Knowledge bases and

Figure 9.  Mapping of EMM components into data mining process steps 
A few types of Business rules are identified by EMM 
(IN rules, DP rules, etc.) usually have a declaratory form, 
note certain events and express them in conditional 
sentences. Figure 9 presents the model, in which the 
components of Enterprise management knowledge can be 
used for a specific data mining process phase. They may be 
useful in choosing the data mining algorithm, through which 
the data will be analyzed. According to the formed rules that 
would define the rules for algorithm model selection, the 
stage of model selection would be controlled. 
Such Enterprise 
business rules, accumulated in 
Knowledge base, can be used in the process of data mining: 
Data processing, Realization, Decision making, and 
Interpretation rules.  
Interpretation rules may be useful in shaping dimensions 
and determining the variables needed for data mining 
model, by determining roles and selecting methods for data 
analysis. Data processing rules will allow controlling data 
selection for data mining. Realization rules can be used in 
choosing the format of displaying results gained during the 
data mining process. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper the control view-based approach to 
integration of data mining and Enterprise knowledge 
modeling was discussed.  
The analysis of Enterprise modeling methods and 
languages (ARIS, UEML, BPMN and detailed Value Chain 
Model) was performed for elicitation of Enterprise 
knowledge components.  
The control view-based Enterprise Meta-model EMM 
(Figure 7) is selected as a rational alternative for Enterprise 
management knowledge modeling. A comparative analysis 
of these Enterprise modeling methods in terms of 
knowledge 
components 
has 
shown 
that 
EMM 
is 
distinguished from other Enterprise modeling methods by a 
detailed structure of identified knowledge. 
Our analysis has shown that it is possible to integrate a 
Knowledge base, which is designed for EMM, into data 
mining process to streamline the implementation of a data 
mining algorithm (Figure 9). Such a data mining system is 
enhanced by Enterprise knowledge subsystem, and can give 
additional semantics and functionality for experts to mine 
more accurate and relevant Enterprise data and knowledge 
components.
