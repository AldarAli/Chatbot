Abstract—The paper at hand shows different aspects of the 
concept of trust. Using the Cross Industry Standard Process 
for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) phase model, we stress the 
information asymmetry of the typical stakeholders in a data 
mining project. Based on the identified influencing factors in 
relation to trust, problematic aspects of the current approach 
are verified. We execute various interviews with the 
stakeholders and the results of the interviews confirm the 
theoretically identified weak points of the phase model with 
regard to trust. Based on the finding, we sketch amendments 
and future research areas. 
Keywords-trust; data mining; CRISP DM; stakeholder 
management. 
I. 
MOTIVATION 
Big data analyses take up an ever-larger part of our lives 
or influence them indirectly. This can be derived from the 
number of scientific publications [1], which can be 
assessed as an indicator of the researchers' interest in the 
subject. Another indicator is the trend in Internet searches 
on the subject, e.g., for the term "Data Science" [2], which 
not only reflects academic interest, but also a broader 
public interest. In addition to the theoretical interest, the 
number of mass market products that are essentially based 
on big data analyses has been increasing for years [3]. The 
same interest can be seen for the term “social media” [4]. 
Data mining algorithms are largely based on heuristics, 
i.e., finding probable solutions with limited knowledge and 
time. This goes hand in hand with probabilities and trust. 
While there is an extensive literature canon on trust in 
general - differences and similarities in trust in general and 
in specific technology - the interactions between people 
who request, create, operate and use a specific data mining 
application with regard to trust and its elements have been 
little explored [5]. The present paper reports on various 
studies of the relationship between big data analyses and, 
in particular, their representation and trust depending on 
the stakeholders involved. Based on the interviews with 
major stakeholders of the data mining process, the paper 
points out open issues and challenges found during the 
survey. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
1, we provide an overview on standard data-mining 
procedures and, based on a literature review, we examine 
different concepts on trust depending on the field of study. 
Both these concepts – data-mining methodology and the 
components influencing trust – are then linked together. In 
Section 4, we present the interview results from several 
identified main stakeholders. Since the concepts behind the 
survey were not equally known by all those involved, 
mainly semi-structured interviews were chosen. The 
results were analyzed qualitatively using Mayring's 
approach [6]. In Section 5, we give a conclusion and list 
the main findings. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
A.  Big Data Analytics (BDA) / Data Mining (DM) 
Big data analyses are not just about the underlying data 
and the resulting analyses but, as with other information 
systems, about the organization of the processes and 
organizational views [7]. This requires the presentation in 
a holistic end-to-end model that connects and coherently 
maps the individual elements. Phase models are 
traditionally used in project management [8] [9], while 
process models, such as Business Process Model and 
Notation (BPMN) [10] have established themselves to map 
the various aspects involved. 
Regardless of the learning type or the methods, the 
Framework Cross Industry Standard Process for Data 
Mining (CRISP DM) has established itself as the standard 
procedure in data mining projects [11] [12]. The model 
describes the basic sequence of individual phases, the 
relationships between one another (see Figure 1) and the 
tasks contained therein (see Figure 2).

The organizational view deals, among other things, 
with the balancing of interests and information of the 
stakeholders involved. Only if all those involved find their 
needs taken into account and respected, they will use the 
results of the analysis. Obviously, an elementary 
component like trust has to be treated at every step of the 
process and cannot be added after the fact. A transfer of 
trust between different stakeholders is, therefore, necessary 
in many process steps for trust in the result of the data 
analysis 
Interestingly, typical tasks are listed and described, but 
no stakeholder identification or explicit role assignment is 
provided for the tasks in the framework. Accordingly, there 
is also no consideration of the relationship of trust between 
the individual stakeholders. As part of this paper, in 
addition to the standard model, the phases within the 
framework of a stakeholder analysis, the typical roles 
involved in a RACI matrix and the information flow were 
analysed (see also [13] [14]). This is certainly open to 
discussion in detail, but several things become clear. In the 
individual phases, there is an information asymmetry to be 
overcome between the stakeholders and thus a situation of 
trust in the above sense. Thus, not only is the algorithm 
itself afflicted with probabilities and thus (trust) risks, the 
roles involved must also build trust among each other in 
order to resolve the information asymmetry - and this at 
different times and in different directions. If data mining is 
used purely in-house, the business user represents the users 
or consumers of data mining in the company and can 
manage the transfer of information and trust. If, however, 
the consumer of data mining is the general public, it is 
necessary for the “business user” to put themselves in the 
most varied of perspectives in the best possible way and to 
create the basis for the transfer of trust for all stakeholders 
not directly involved. To make matters worse, the general 
public is very heterogeneous - both in their personal 
attitudes and experience, as well as in their institutional 
environment. 
The business user should take the perspective of all 
major representatives and anticipate and manage their 
expectations. Looking at the model, (see Figure 1) it 
becomes clear that this management has to be taken into 
account both when considering the origin of the data and 
when communicating the evaluation results / key figures.

B. Acceptance and Trust 
Trust is a complex concept that is defined differently in 
numerous 
disciplines 
depending 
on 
the 
specific 
circumstances. An additional complicating factor is that 
trust is also used in everyday scenarios, which results in a 
multitude of meanings without any reference to a concept. 
In a much-cited 1964 standard by Kaplan, the author goes 
so far as to recommend that researchers focus on a specific 
component of trust rather than a generalized view [15]. If, 
in addition to the use of the term in one language, one also 
considers the translation into other languages, there is a 
large number of uses and synonyms with clear deviations 
in 
the 
connotation. 
Cooperation, 
confidence 
and 
predictability are closely related terms that Mayer et al. 
used to describe the term in English [16 p. 729]. Trust is 
the basis for accepting vulnerability from people, 
technology and, in our case, the use of data analysis results 
[17]. 
To measure acceptance of an application or technology 
in business informatics, the Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM) is often used [17] [19]. 
In Figure 3, the "Attitude Towards Using" is the 
readiness for use, which is influenced by "Perceived 
Usefulness" and "Perceived Ease-of-Use". The “Perceived 
Usefulness” describes the expected benefit, while the 
“Perceived Ease-of-Use” describes the costs for the user to 
learn how to use the technology and thus indirectly the 
costs of building trust. Due to its simplicity, it is easy to use 
and popular. However, the model focuses on the user and 
the lack of consideration of the situation / structure is often 
criticized [20 p. 30]. Furthermore, it does not take time into 
account and, therefore, a separation of initial trust and 
continued trust is not explicitly described in the model.

Closely related concepts to trust come from 
psychology, sociology and social psychology, the latter 
being understood as a bridge between the former. While 
psychology focuses on the person-to-person relationship, 
sociology focuses on the organization-to-organization 
relationship. What they all have in common is to define 
trust as “the willingness to take risks” [21 p. 103] or the 
“intention to accept vulnerability” [22 p. 395]. Basically, 
Mayer, Davis and Schoorman show that both the personal 
influence and the organizational or institutional influence 
of taking risks can be characterized on the basis of 
competence, benevolence and integrity [16]. 
After an intensive comparison of the literature, 
McKnight and Chervany succeeded in bridging the gap 
between the above-mentioned disciplines and showing the 
interdependencies [23]. The authors separate between 
trusting believes as the extent to which a target is likely to 
behave in a way that is "benevolent, competent, honest, 
predictable in a situation” and the trusting intentions as the 
extent to which a person is willing to make himself 
vulnerable to another person’s actions [23]. 
In a further work, McKnight et al. show that the original 
characteristics (aka trusting beliefs) of trust in people can 
be transferred to trust in technologies (functionality, 
helpfulness, reliability) [5 p. 9]. Thus, the original concept 
is not limited to natural persons, but can be transferred to 
people, technologies / objects and even processes [24]. 
While Figure 4 links different research fields and explains 
influencing factors from the personal disposition to the 
trusting intentions, it does not take into account the 
dimension „time“. While continued trust and trusting 
intentions result from experience and, therefore, the 
balance of incentives and penalties resulting from trusting, 
initial trust results from trust transfer - either from person, 
groups or places [25]–[27]. 
The microeconomic theory as a further subject area 
investigates trust in its own branch of research - 
information theory. It offers a complementary model to the 
explanatory approaches above. Here, the focus is on trust 
in goods and the costs of evaluating their properties, less 
on individual disposition. The underlying assumption is 
that the information market does not exhibit high degrees 
of transparency. That is, to evaluate the information, the 
information must be known, so one has to invest in learning 
it to evaluate it [28]. In principle, a distinction is made 
between three types of goods: search goods, experience 
goods and credence goods. Search goods can be evaluated 
before purchase or use and, therefore, trusted due to 
previous 
experience 
or 
easily 
available 
product 
information. Search goods are well known and represent 
continued trust. Experience goods can be evaluated only 
after purchase and, therefore, trusted after the purchase and 
need either a transfer of trust or reduced penalties (e.g., a 
„refund policy“). Credence goods cannot be evaluated due 
to prohibitive information retrieval costs or singularity and 
depend always on external trust transfer [29] [30]. This 
links the model nicely to the initial model: search goods 
have a strong linkage towards trust transfer and/ or 
previous experienced trust, experience goods need initial 
trust and a positive experience balance for continued usage, 
and credence goods cannot personally be evaluated over 
time at all and depend entirely on trust transfer. 
From their perspective, all the models presented above 
are justified and complement each other. The technology 
acceptance model focuses heavily on the acceptance of a 
technology without addressing explicitly the wider trust 
aspect. However, McKnight’s model explains the impact of 
trust in technology and links personal and environmental 
attitudes, while the microeconomic model deepens insights 
into how costs affect trust transfer. 
C. Linking CRISP DM and Trust 
There is only very limited amount of literature about 
what influences trust in data mining analyses. If one looks 
at the underlying knowledge and skills of the individual 
stakeholders in the individual phases of the CRISP DM 
model (see Figure 1), they will see a strong information 
asymmetry. To make matters worse, it is noticeable that the 
responsibility changes in the phases (see Table 1), and 
external information interests are not explicitly in the focus 
of the model. This is associated with relatively high costs 
for obtaining information. Thus, the next step is to evaluate 
the current practical approaches and problems by 
interviewing the stakeholders involved. 
There are two basic approaches to understand data - 
compressing the information into key figures/ metrics and 
visualizing it in graphics. Measures have been around since 
the dawn of mathematics and are widely used in a wide 
variety of scientific fields. visualisations of data are just as 
old as key figures, but have been experiencing increased 
interest since the 1970s, beginning with Tukey’s 
“Exploratory Data Analysis” [31] and the “Box Plots”. 
Currently, the increased computing power enables complex 
representations of high-dimensional data and leads to 
innovative and highly complex forms of representation, 
e.g., t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) 
[32]. While t-SNE or Uniform Manifold Approximation 
and Projection (UMAP) help to understand the data 
directly, graph based visualisation helps to understand 
hierarchies and dependencies between data or Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) [33]. As an independent 
specialist discipline, however, visualisation is quite young 
[34].

DATA ANALYTICS 2022 : The Eleventh International Conference on Data Analytics

Both approaches are to be viewed critically: the key  
metric α (significance level) used most frequently in 
statistics and the corresponding p-value (probability) are so 
often misinterpreted in the scientific literature that the 
American Statistical Association opposed in 2018 another 
use of the term “significance” pronounced [35] [36]. On 
the other hand, visualisations are not problem-free either. 
A sub-goal of visualisation is to increase the perceived and 
cognitively processed amount of information and to 
capture interdependencies in the data structures through 
aggregation and emphasis. This is intended to support the 
correctness of decisions and confidence in the decision 
[37]. Thus, visualisations are not neutral either and depend 
on the ideas of the creators [38]. 
Recently, to overcome the aforementioned issues, there 
is a trend to combine key figures/ metrics with 
visualisations 
or 
allow 
using 
interaction 
in 
the 
visualisation. In order to develop a balanced strategy across 
all critical goals and their respective KPIs, it is particularly 
important to discover the inherent relationships between all 
KPIs. In this case, graph-based representations are 
particularly suitable [39] [40]. 
D. Identified Research Area 
Freedom oﬀered by modern societies, access to loads 
of sources of information and increased complexities force 
people to cope with the uncertainty of the global world by 
themselves. If one considers the factors presented that are 
important for the trust of the individual stakeholders and if 
one also considers the CRISP DM phase model, it becomes 
apparent that the currently leading framework does not 
explicitly pay attention to the transfer of trust between the 
stakeholders involved. It should also be clear that trust 
must be observed from the beginning to the end - 
interrupting the analysis process would disrupt the 
transmission of trust. It is important to consistently monitor 
the level of knowledge of all persons involved. Since the 
analysis process cannot be explained personally to 
everyone, it is important to create a framework that 
passively enables it. A process-oriented, graph-based 
visual representation as well as additional, generally 
understandable visualisations should help to show the 
connections and thus reduce the information asymmetry 
between the stakeholders. This should be practically 
substantiated in the following summarized interview with 
the stakeholders (see Table 2). 
III. PRACTICAL SURVEY 
As in the theoretical model, trust or the transfer of trust 
depends on the personal environment (“dispositional 
trust”), the environment (“institutional trust”) and specific 
influencers (“interpersonal trust”). In order to obtain a 
representative picture, identified stakeholders were 
interviewed using different survey methods . In addition to 
the typical stakeholders already identified (see Table 1), the 
list was expanded to include “normal consumers” 
(“consumer A”) and “informed consumers” (“consumer 
B”). 
In the interviews conducted, the aim was to show which 
aspects - from the stakeholder's point of view - are 
necessary in order to develop or transfer trust in data 
analyses. The questionnaire was based on the identified 
trust influencing factors during all phases of CRISP DM. 
Consumer were asked to compare results from data mining 
analyses with previous expert analyses.

A. S1 Data Analyst Representative 
The data analyst has specialist knowledge of the 
technical analysis of data, its consistent preparation and the 
use of appropriate statistical or data mining methods. He 
needs information about the data used and the business 
objective of the analysis. 
Interview 
For the interview, 3 data scientists were asked 
independently of each other which indicators they believe 
are relevant in order to trust the data and models. Then they 
were presented with various business KPIs and 
visualisations of their department together with the 
respective business representative and the similarities and 
differences in understanding were determined. 
Main concerns and issues 
In the business understanding, it was difficult for the 
stakeholders involved to interpret the specific KPIs. 
Concrete examples and the representation of the processes 
through graphics were essential for understanding. 
The interviews showed that the KPIs used to justify the 
analysis results were rarely understood or misunderstood. 
In principle, graphic representations were preferred by 
the 
other 
stakeholders 
involved. 
More 
complex 
representations were accepted, but required more detailed 
descriptions, and here again the data analysts often 
struggled with the business terms. As a compromise for 
understanding, several simple graphics that build on one 
another were used. 
B. S2 Business Representative 
The 
business 
analyst 
represents 
the 
business 
perspective of the departments and has special knowledge 
of his department. He alone can make sense of the data and 
explain their origin and meaning and practically validate 
the results. 
Interview 
For the interview, 3 representatives were interviewed 
independently of each other regarding their intentions 
during the phases in which they are responsible. Then they 
were presented with various KPIs and visualisations of 
their department together with the respective data analysts 
and the similarities and differences in understanding were 
determined. 
Main concerns and issues 
The concerns and issues of data analysts reflect the 
concerns and issues found among business users.

C. S3 Project Sponsor/ Management Perspective 
In addition to the roles of data analyst and business 
user, which are involved operationally, the project sponsor 
is another relevant role that is more strategically oriented. 
His trust in the implementation and the results decides 
initially and finally on the resources used and the use of the 
results. As a managing role, which is not directly involved 
but is regularly informed about the analysis and the results, 
his trust can be seen as the first test of trustworthiness. This 
role is also responsible to a not inconsiderable extent for 
the design of the environment, ergo it exerts a great 
influence on the "institutional trust". 
Interview 
For the analysis, 10 senior IT managers were asked 
about their criteria for building trust in a guided interview. 
The following section summarizes the answers and the 
underlying intentions. 
Main concerns and issues 
Looking at the key considerations and underlying 
intentions, the focus is clearly on promoting institutional 
trust rather than understanding individual BDA and its 
metrics. The interviewees emphasized that building a high-
quality and transparent data infrastructure is essential for 
trust in the results. There were different opinions as to 
whether this should be done step-by-step or with a “big 
bang”. While the majority emphasizes the "step-by-step" 
approach and thus the step-by-step understanding of the 
data, a minority fears that too narrow a focus will limit the 
reference power of the data too much. All project sponsors 
emphasize that a common understanding is important. To 
achieve this goal, KPIs, a commonly understood language 
- which also includes visualisation, are used. For the most 
part, however, the internal stakeholders are taken into 
account, but the perspective of the external stakeholders is 
primarily included through reference to legal data sources. 
D. S4 Consumer 
When analysing the consumer, a distinction must be 
made between two stakeholders. The difference lies in the 
existing experience with analyses. One group are the 
consumers who have no experience with data mining 
analysis, data and procedures (see Table 2: “S4A: Normal 
Consumer”). On the other hand, there are consumers who 
were not directly involved in the analysis but have personal 
experience with similar data mining projects (see Table 2: 
“S4B: Informed Consumer”). 
Consumers use the results directly for their own 
purposes, e.g., fitness wearables or evaluations in 
magazines. However, consumers can also be indirectly 
affected by the results of the analysis, e.g., as bank 
customers who are subject to a risk classification when 
requesting a loan. 
E. S4A: Normal Consumer 
Interview 
In a semi-structured interview, 23 people between the 
ages of 20 and 60 were asked which factors are relevant for 
them in different contexts in order to trust data mining 
analyses. 
Main concerns and issues 
The results of the data mining were accepted to a very 
limited extent. Without a well-founded justification for the 
refusal, it was doubted that the data were representative and 
reflected the personal circumstances. Although trust was 
positively influenced by the spread of the BDA (e.g., 
wearables/ web portals) and by certificates, the results are 
doubted by 70% - 80% of the respondents and used 
personally. When it comes to acceptance, the personal 
opinion of a specialist or friends prevails. If trust has arisen 
through the transfer of trust from third parties, the trust is 
not shaken by isolated negative examples or experiences. 
In principle, the respondents do not see themselves in a 
position to validate the data bases and functionalities and 
need support from their environment. 
F. S4B: Informed Consumer 
Interview 
In the interviews, three scientists were questioned in a 
semi-structured interview. They were not actively involved 
in the analyses, but they were familiar with the 
environment. 
Main concerns and issues 
The expert survey revealed that these people generally 
trust the analyses, but inform themselves about the data 
collection, data processing and methods used on a random 
basis. A renowned environment of the BDA reduces the 
scope of own validations, but is not sufficient. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In principle, the results of the data mining process are 
accepted by the stakeholders involved in the analysis, but 
trust in the results correlated strongly with the proximity to 
the process and the associated costs of information 
procurement. 
In the business and data understanding, the business 
and data analyst representatives attached great importance 
to understanding the data and assessing its quality. Less 
value was placed on a detailed verbal description, the focus 
was more on use cases and easily understandable key 
figures. 
While the specialists tend to orientate themselves 
towards the key figures of their specialist area during the 
evaluation, the other stakeholders involved prefer visual 
representations in addition to the key figures. Key figures 
are accepted without understanding their meaning in 
particular. In order to understand the statements and to trust 
the results, visual representations prevail. There, too, a 
trend towards rather simple, well-known representations 
was discernible. For example, a combination of histogram 
and box plot was preferred to a violin plot. 
The preparation of the analysis process for later users 
was less of a focus. A fundamental desire was established 
among all stakeholders to present their findings or interests 
transparently. However, they often do not realize that the 
technical terms that describe their special field are not 
universally understandable. Thus, in data science projects, 
the focus should be on a more understandable language in 
advance. In particular, the visualisation seems to have a 
greater influence on the overall understanding than on 
specific key figures. 
Based on the findings, it would certainly be helpful to 
add a stakeholder-oriented view to the CRISP DM 
framework. It should be essential to meet both the 
information needs of the specialists and to balance the 
16

information asymmetry among the stakeholders. In 
addition to specific, subject-related key figures, this view 
should be integrated into the CRISP DM process as well as 
simple visualized representations and generally accessible 
key figures. This view should also depict the chronological 
sequence and, so to speak, represent the information 
transformation nose to tail. In order to do justice to the 
different levels of knowledge, it should be able to depict 
different levels of detail.
