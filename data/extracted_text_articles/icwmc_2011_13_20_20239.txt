Abstract— Usage of technology MIMO in standard 802.11n 
allows to increase data transmission to 300 Mbit/s. This 
network successful operation is necessary to send signals from 
transmitting antenna to receiving antenna in different ways, 
that is there is multibeam reflection an indoor. This research is 
suggested to obtain the optimal interflection time by special 
indoor treatment. The radio wave propagation statisctical 
theory is consider by Author an indoor, the time Interflection T 
defenition formula is derived. According to author conclusions 
the time T can be selected by indoor special treatment: 
disposing of surface with high reflection coefficient indoors. 
Time T increases from 210 ns (before indoor treatment) to 390 
ns(after room treatment). Increasing time T more then 400 ns 
author doesn’t recommended, as «guard time» may be 
exceeded and required result does not achive. Practical 
researches with standard 802.11n equipment using confirm the 
theoretical conclusions and show, that data transmission rate 
after treatment increases to 10-15% upon the average.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In the modern communication system intercomputer 
channel bandwidth is need to increase. The bandwidth may 
be increased by frequency band expansion or radiating 
power rise. Nevertheless such methods have disadvantages 
because of human ecological safety and electromagnetic 
compatibility frequency band expansion or radiating power 
rise is limited. So, if the required data rate isn’t provided by 
possible frequency band expansion or radiating power rise, 
one of the effective problem solution may be usage of 
adaptive antenna arrays with a weakly correlated antenna 
elements. Communication systems, which used such 
antenna, is named MIMO system (Multiple Input Multiple 
Output). Such system uses at making of wireless network of 
IEEE 802.11n standard, which was approved in September 
11, 2009. 
Standard 802.11n the data rate increases in almost four 
times compared to the 802.11g standard devices( which 
maximal rate is equal to 54 Mbps) on conditions that it uses 
in regime 802.11n with other with device 802.11n. 
High date rate is provided by: 
1. Large quantity of bearing usage: 802.11g with 48 
bearing against 802.11n with 52 – increases bandwidth from 
54 Mbps to 58.5 Mbps. 
2. FEC (Forward Error Correction): 802.11g has maximal 
value FEC - 3/4, 802.11n — 5/6. Increased bandwidth from 
58.5 Mbps to 65 Mbps. 
3. Guard Interval: 802.11a guard interval between 
transmission is 800 ns. In 802.11n it is decreased to 400 ns, 
so bandwidth increases from Mbps to 72.2 Mbps. 
4. MIMO: spatial multiplexing can support a linear 
increase in bandwidth depending on the number of antennas 
on each side. The standard maximum permitted number of 
antennas is four. This allows to increase the total bandwidth 
up to 288.9 Mbps the subject to 72.2 Mbps channel. 
5. Channels 40 MHz: all previous versions of 802.11 have 
the bandwidth 20MHz. 802.11n has a mode for the bearing 
channel width of 40 MHz. Due to the increasing amount of 
data bandwidth per channel is increased from 52 to 108. 
This increases the overall throughput to 150 Mbps. Taking 
into account the 4 channels of MIMO technology can 
theoretically get the speed of 600 Mbps. 
802.11n devices work in the range 2.4 - 2.5 or 5.0 GHz. 
In this case, you can use one of three modes: 
1. HT Greenfield mode - means that the next device does 
not use the old standards on the same frequency. If they try 
to do this, they will not be able to connect at 802.11n. 
2. Non-HT (Legacy) mode - 802.11n AP in a Non-HT 
mode sends all packets in the old format 802.11a/g, so all 
devices can understand it. 
3. HT Mixed mode - as soon as the majority points 
802.11n will work in device support 802.11b/g and 802.11a. 
HT Enhancements will be used at the same time with the 
mechanism of HT Protection, which will enable devices to 
work with old cards. 
During the ten-year period of work the following 
problems is identified and partially solved: 
1.The unpredictability of coverage. In previous versions 
of wireless coverage was close to spherical. In networks 
with 802.11n coverage area has a complex structure and 
difficult to calculation and planning. 
2. In the range of 2.4 GHz can only use one channel of 40 
MHz. The most perspective usage of such a regime is in the 
range of 5GHz. 
3. Network performance 802.11n in the range of 2.4 - 2.5

GHz decreases due to the small value of signal to noise ratio 
(SNR) due to the presence of a large number of devices 
operating in the same range: Bluetooth, Microwave Ovens, 
Cordless phones, Wireless Cameras, Game controllers , 
Baby Monitors, Digital video devices and many more. It is 
recommended to use a range of 5.0 GHz, in which the noise 
is much less. 
4. When the bandwidth of a cable connection wireless 
access points to the wired network is more than 100 Mbps, 
the trouble in the way of traffic becomes a wireless 
controller, a speed which is recommended to increase up to 
1 Gbps. 
5. Wireless network security: a large coverage area 
implies an increase in risk of unauthorized access, 
illegitimate passive devices can listen to the broadcast, 
unnoticed, Fluke Networks products can detect the device 
(including passive) connected to the network 802.11n; 
40MHz channel scan takes twice as much time than 
scanning 20MHz channel mechanism of block confirmation 
of 802.11n is the vulnerability to DoS attacks. 
6. One access point can connect up to 254 users. The 
bandwidth of a single half-duplex radio channel is divided 
into all simultaneously transmitting users. Given the 
numerous repetitions of data transmission because of 
conflicts with their simultaneous transmission of real 
bandwidth per user goes down to very small quantities. 
Therefore, the number of concurrent clients in terms of a 
single point of access must be in the range of 12 to 50. For 
example, this problem manifested itself during the Mobile 
World Congress [1]. 
MIMO enables omni-directional transmission on a lot of 
antenna pairs. This ensures they get the signal receiver and 
is called spatial streams. Data packet can be divided into 
several packets and sent on different streams. The receiver 
collects them back into a single data packet. 802.11n 
supports up to 4 threads. But more often considered the 
standard antenna configuration circuit for transmitting and 
receiving information, 3 × 3 or 2 × 3. 
Many researchers engages, eg [2,3], to raise productivity 
wireless IEEE 802.11n standard. These works are devoted 
to the advancement of the antennas and radio devices. A 
distinctive feature of our work is that we are engaged in the 
advancement of the transmission medium, since the success 
of MIMO operation mode is necessary to establish such a 
regime under which the multipath propagation of radio 
waves. We limit the wireless network work in one room. 
This regime occurs when installing access points in places 
of public access: restaurants, libraries, hotel lobby, etc. The 
aim of this work - forming the best possible conditions of 
multibeam propagation in a room and experimental 
verification of the results. 
II. 
THE STATISTICAL THEORY OF RADIOWAVES DISTRIBUTION 
IN INDOOR 
With the standard 802.11 POP in an indoor the signal 
doesn’t only reach to subscriber P on the right line, but also 
on the ways repeatedly broken through the signal reflections 
from walls, a ceiling and a floor indoors. At each signal‘s 
reflection from surfaces, limiting an indoor the some part of 
signal’s energy is absorbed, in spite of all this the reflected 
signal level at the subscriber will be quite enough for 
creating a handicap, named interference, at the expense of a 
phase difference. 
Let’s examine a definition problem of time, during which 
the interferential handicaps level will reduced to the 
acceptable signal-to-noise ratio value. Let’s name the time T 
as interflection time.

Figure 1.  Repeated reflexion of radio-waves indoors 
Through each point in indoor volume the great number of 
the reflected waves passes moving on various directions at a 
time. Field strength and vibrational speed vector in each 
point are determined by result of an interference of all these 
waves. In this case to calculate a signal level in each point is 
represented with difficulty sufficiently. However, the great 
number of interference waves suggests the problem to be 
solved by statistical treatment with usage of the 
mathematical probability theory basis at least in some cases. 
Assuming, that orientations, amplitudes and phases of 
waves superimposed on each other are distributed more or 
less chaotically, we can examine these waves as not 
coherent and consider the energy density in each point to be 
the sum of the energy density connected to each these 
waves. If wave movement in an indoor really has such 
indigested character without presence of oscillatory 
movement 
prevailing 
directions 
and 
symmetry 
in 
amplitudes distribution, research statistical methods are 
quite right and lead to the important practical results [4]. 
Statistical research of electromagnetic fields in the closed 
indoors requires prior average time definition between two 
consecutive signal reflections from surfaces, limiting a 
indoors, and also an reflections average undergone by radio-
waves in unit of time. Let’s imagine the surface element dS, 
limiting volume V of an indoor and a radio-wave, moving at 
an angle of θ to an element dS normal (Fig.2). What 
probability that this wave will fall to platform dS per unit 
time from t to t+dt? We take notice, that during dt on 
platform dS only the electromagnetic wave energy, being 
contained in volume of the cylinder with basis dS and height 
c0dtcosθ (where c0 - speed of distribution of a radio-wave), 
can fall at an angle of θ.

The multiplier ½ explains that a wave movement can be 
in the platform direction, or in an opposite direction with 
equal probability. 
It is necessary to take into account, what probability will 
be that some wave chosen randomly pass at an angle of θ to 
dS. For probability definition we will surround a platform 
dS with a hemisphere of any radius r and allocate band on a 
hemisphere with the area 2πrsinθ⋅rdθ, on which the radius - 
vector r forms with a normal dS at an angle of θ (Fig.3). 
The probability of falling wave at an angle between θ and 
θ+dθ is the correlation of the area band to a surface to a 
hemisphere 2πr2:

As mentioned above, some part of energy is absorbed at 
each signal reflection from surfaces limiting an indoor. It is 
necessary to specify an absorptivity quantitative measure of 
these surfaces for calculation of signal reflexions duration 
obviously. Let’s designate symbol α as an average value of 
energy relative reduction at each separate absorption act of a 
signal 
E
α = ∆E
,  
 
( 9 ) 
There is E - the general energy store of indoors before 
the absorption act, ∆E - average size of the energy absorbed 
by an indoor surface per the one act. It is clear, that the size, 
defined by the formula (9), has only statistical meaning: as 
separate signal's absorption acts occur place at falling of 
279

waves under different angles on the surfaces possessing, 
generally speaking, various absorbed ability, the energy ∆E 
absorbed per the one act, can actually have the various 
values being subject to statistical averaging at invariable size 
E. Last condition is satisfied, obviously, in a stationary 
conditions when the energy transmitted by a signal source, 
continuously fills up the losses, caused by signal absorption 
indoors. We consider the average energy to be absorbed per 
the one act is proportional to the general energy store 
indoors: ∆E =αE.

The formula (9) defines α as average relative reduction of 
signal energy indoors in the one absorption act. But, in 
addition to that, it is possible to give to coefficient α other 
interpretation. 
Energy ∆E falling at small time ∆t on surface S, limiting 
volume V of an indoor, it is possible to define, multiplying 
an energy stock E on the probability of its falling calculated 
on time ∆t. According to (5), this probability is

( 12 ) 
If one see, that the indoor is limited by a homogeneous 
for the physical properties surface (12) defines factor α as 
the relation of the energy absorbed by this surface, to 
energy, diffusely falling on it. The term «diffusive falling» 
[5] concerns to ergodic process when all directions of 
carrying over energy signal are equiprobable. It is possible 
to define, therefore, α as signal absorption factor(in 
conditions diffusive fields) such homogeneous surface 
which, limiting an indoor, causes the same losses of signal 
energy, as well as actually cash non-uniform surface. So 
size α we name average absorption factor, and its product 
on surface S we name the general absorption of a premise 
S

 ( 13 ) 
If the indoor is limited by surfaces S1, S2… with 
absorption factors α1, α2… (measured in conditions 
diffusive an electromagnetic field) the general absorption is 
defined by the sum of absorption separate surface sites:

The reasons developed above, give the chance of the a

statistical calculation in the closed indoor. Let at the 
moment of time t=0 in an indoor the signal source starts to 
do with capacity P per unit time τ, equal to average 
radiowave mean free path, the signal source gives energy Pτ 
indoor. As a result of the first reflection, that is by the 
moment 2τ, from this energy there will be a part Pτ(1-α 
according to 9. But a signal source again gives to an indoor 
energy Pτ per an time interval from τ up to 2τ. Thus, by the

where αi – absorption coefficient of one of the

The problem is that up to date the data on absorption 
coefficient of radio waves of range 2.4 and 5 for materials 
used in modern buildings are quite limited. 
To determine radio wave absorption coefficient we 
suggest applying the method described in [6], which refers to 
radio wave of range 2.4 GHz reflection coefficient for three-
layered environment in this work.

THE METHOD OF MEASURING DIELECTRIC CAPACITIVITY 
To explore the dielectric properties of the materials the 
waveguide method of short-circuit contact and free running 
[6] is the optimal one. The method is based on defining the 
standing wave ratio (SWR) and the phase of a microwave 
281

signal passing though a sample. First the microwave path is 
calibrated by choosing the reference plane while measuring 
wave phase. To be able to do that we should define the 
standing wave short-circuited line minimum position. After 
that the shorted waveguide section without sample is 
connected to the line end. The shorted plane shifts a bit, as 
the section length isn’t equal to the integer number of 
radiation half-waves in the waveguide. 
After calibration the waveguide section with a sample is 
set on the microwave path which results in shifting the 
standing wave minimum as the minimum depends on 
dielectric in question properties. The standing wave 
minimum / dielectric properties ratio is calculated on the 
basis of the respective electrodynamic problem which is 
reduced to a complex transcendental equationequation. The 
usage of waveguide method of short and free running [7] 
allows to avoid the solution of this equation. This method 
provides reliable results and consists in SWR measurement 
and shifting standing wave minimum with regard to the 
chosen reference plane for a given sample, at the end of 
which the shorted and free running conditions are created. 
Skipping the derivation, we only give the final formula to 
calculate the imaginary and real part of complex dielectric 
capacitivity ε’ and ε’’:

Absolute measurement error ε′ is not more than 0.5. 
The above-given measurements allow to obtain ε’ and ε’’ 
value for different materials used indoor. In turn this allows 
to define the average absorption coefficient α value for such 
materials applying formulas (28-33). The resultant value 
allows to calculate time T (time Interflection) for the indoor 
processes. 
IV. 
APPLICATION OF THE STATISTICAL THEORY AT 
CONSTRUCTION OF WIRELESS NETWORKS 
The network using technology MIMO is required to 
optimize the magnitude T. Time T is calculated for given 
indoor by (22). Having received theoretical calculation 
results the wireless network practical research in indoor is 
carried out. We used the wireless network Radio Ethernet, 
making with standard equipment IEEE 802.11n usage. 
Router Linksys WRT610N, Netgear WNDR3700 and 
TRENDnet TEW-671BR are used as POP. 
The research was carried out with method [8] and rate 
was measured by IxChariot (http://www.ixiacom.com). 
TCP-traffic (with max size package mainly) is generated 
by the program and different situation as receiving, 
transmission and both synchronous(direction to adapter in 
PC) is modeling. 
POP (Depending from model no all point was available) 
is set to operate with 802.11n range on channel 1(5) in 
regime «40 MHz», previous generation network security 
regime was switched off, ciphering WPA2-PSK whit с AES 
algorithm was switched on. Others setting were standart. 
That network works sufficiently stable should take into 
account, as data transmission rate negligible changed during 
all test. After first examination cycle we did indoor 
treatment, placed supplementary elements with high 
reflection property. These elements placed behind POP and 
along radio wave diffusion trace. To avoid the standing 
wave reflection element planes placed by different angle to 
each other. Time T increased from 210 ns to 390 ns 
according to calculation results. Increase time T more 400

CONCLUSIONS 
In section 2 we developed a statistical theory in result of 
the mathematical analysis of radio wave propagation in a 
room. Statistical theory of propagation in a room to 
determine interfleksion time during which the level of 
interference noise is reduced to the permissible ratio of NSR 
values. In Section 3 we proposed a method for finding the 
dielectric constant materials. Using the theory [6] we were 
able to find the various materials radio waves absorption 
coefficients used in buildings. Knowing these values by 
(23,24), we calculated the interfleksion time for a particular 
room. . a special treatment, which increases the value with 
the value 210 ns to a value of 390 ns, is held to ensure the 
regime of radio waves multiple reflection from the surfaces 
of the room. Treatment included the location of the 
additional elements with high reflective properties. Such 
elements are located beyond the access point and along the 
propagation. In order not to set up standing waves, the plane 
of the reflecting elements have not been parallel, they was at 
various angles to each other. Increased time interflection to 
400 ns, we do not recommend, since it can lead to problems 
with the guard interval. 
With this program IxChariot we simulated different 
situations: reception, transfer, simultaneous transmission and 
reception (direction - with respect to the adapter to a PC) 
with the packages mainly the maximum size. The 
comparison was performed on 4 basic parameters: 
Throughput (Mbs), Response time (ms), TCP Throughput 
(Mbs), UDP Throughput (Mbs). Speed was estimated by the 
maximum value, Response time -to the minimum value. The 
maximum speed of 170 Mbs was reached at a frequency of 
5GHz mode UDP Throughput with using a router Linksys 
WRT610N. In the 5GHz range devices creating noise is less 
than in the 2.4 GHz range, so a top speed is managed to 
achieve only in 123 Mbs in this range. In general, the 
increase in the rate was 10-15% compared with the rate in 
the room, not being processed. 
The experimental results are consistent with the 
developed theory. The theory may be used to improve the 
performance of a wireless network for 802.11n in the room. 
Further, our work will focus on establishing a program to 
perform calculations according to advanced theories and 
experimental works on the transfer of video and audio 
wireless client.

The statistical theory of radio-waves distribution in 
indoor allows to define time interflection T achievements of 
demanded parity SNR. The Indoor after-treatment processing 
is carried out by selection in large area extent indoors with 
small factor of absorption for demanded technology MIMO 
interference noise level achievement. These surfaces are 
placed to increase T in wireless clients place.  
Mentioned above method usage allows to increase data 
transmission rate in the indoor at wireless network design.
