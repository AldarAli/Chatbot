Abstract‚ÄîA fundamental requirement for any cellular system is 
the possibility for the device to request a connection setup, 
commonly referred to as random access procedure. In Long 
Term Evolution (LTE) networks, the distribution of a limited 
number of radio resources among Human-to-Human (H2H) 
users and increasing number of Machine-Type-Communication 
(MTC) devices in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications 
is one of the main problems. An analytical model is conducted to 
compute the throughput for message 1 and message 2 using a 
Markov chain model for the four messages signaling flow with 
buffering for message 4 in LTE Third-Generation Partnership 
Project (3GPP) random access. The network performance will be 
enhanced by determining a dedicated arrival rate corresponding 
to maximum throughput of message 2 that will assist the network 
planner to optimize the network performance.

INTRODUCTION 
In the last decades, mobile communication has evolved from 
being an expensive technology for a few selected individuals to 
today‚Äôs ubiquitous systems used by a majority of the world‚Äôs 
population [1]. Modern wireless communication schemes like 
3GPP LTE network, do not allow serving effectively M2M 
connections between a huge numbers of interacting MTC 
devices. A good background of this issue "when a huge number 
of machines request access" was explained in [2]. Increasing 
the network performance is not possible due to the finance 
approach. One possible solution of the problem is based on the 
use of random access procedure (RACH) procedure [3]. 
Increasing network capacity is the major objectives of LTE 
network. This increasing will provide high data rates for end 
users with low latency, ensure high Quality of Service (QoS), 
and reduce the cost. For channel access and ensuring the 
Quality of Service (QoS), there are two attributes of random 
access procedures in LTE: contention-free and contention-
based random access. 
In contention-free random access, the e-NodeB signals a 
reserved preamble for the mobile station, thus avoiding the 
contention. In contention-based random access, all mobile 
stations need to participate in contention for the resources [4]. 
A very huge number of machines, such as user equipment 
(UE) may dwell in coverage area of cell, which may request to 
access the network periodically or sporadically. They also 
have a small power that must be used as efficiently as 
possible. The 3GPP has carried in different studies [5] [6] that 
try to address the issues related to M2M communications in 
the present systems, as well as in the future releases of LTE. A 
detailed study and analysis of physical downlink control 
channel (PDCCH) performance for M2M traffic in LTE was 
introduced in [7]. 
The main aim of this paper is to obtain the upper band of 
the request arrival rate in order to sustain the network 
performance metric such as the throughput for MTC in LTE 
network. An explicit analysis for evaluation of throughput for 
message 1 and message 2 using a Markov chain model for the 
four messages signaling flow with buffering for message 4 in 
LTE 3GPP random access is presented. 
This paper is organized as follows: random access 
procedure using four messages in LTE network is explained in 
Section 2. Markov chain model for transient states for the four 
messages with queuing buffer for message 4 and model 
assumptions and analysis is introduced in Section 3. In Section 
4, results and verification are shown. Section 5 is devoted to 
conclusion. 
II. RANDOM ACCESS PROCEDURE   
A brief description of the contention-based random access 
procedure utilized, for example, by the MTC traffic, is 
explained as follow. 
Step 1: The MTC device (UE) requests to initiate the 
RACH procedure by selecting one of the available RACH 
preambles randomly and then sending the preamble in 
Message 1 over the physical random access channel (PRACH) 
in the uplink. A collision occurs when two or more machines 
(UEs) get the same preamble in the same subframe. However, 
after preamble sending the UE waits for a random access 
response (RAR) (Message 2) from the e-NodeB within the 
time interval called a response window [3], i.e., even if two or 
more UEs use the same preamble for Message 1 and a 
collision occurs, the e- NodeB will detect this event and will 
not send reply to UE. The transmission of a random access 
preamble is restricted to certain subframes. Let b denote their 
periodicity, i.e., random access is possible in every bth 
subframe. In addition, let K denote the total number of 
available preambles. 
Step 2: e-NodeB replies with Message 2, which is also 
known as the RAR and it includes UL grant for Step 3. 
Message 2 is sent over the physical downlink shared channel 
(PDSCH). So, schedule the user is needed [7], i.e., send a

downlink assignment control message over the PDCCH. There 
may be at most one RAR message in each subframe, but each 
may have more than one UL grant (each referring to a 
different preamble). Let c is defined as the maximum number 
of UL grants per RAR per subframe. Note that in this model, 
an UL grant is given for every uncollided preamble. 
Step 3: In the case of successful preamble transmission 
after receiving Message 2 from the e-NodeB and RAR 
processing time, the UE sends a RRC connection request 
(Message 3) to the e-NodeB over Physical Uplink Shared 
Channel (PUSCH). 
Step 4: RACH procedure is completed after the UE 
receiving a contention resolution message (Message 4) from 
the e-NodeB. Hybrid Automatic Repeat request (HARQ) 
procedure guarantees a successful transmission of Message 3/ 
Message 4. HARQ procedure provides a limit in Message 3/ 
Message 4 sequential transmission attempts. If the limit is 
reached UE should start a new RACH procedure by sending a 
preamble. 
 
 
Figure 1. Four messages control signaling flow sequence in LTE random 
access. [1] 
Let N be defined as the PDCCH resource size (in control 
channel elements CCEs), NMsg2 and NMsg4 are the number of 
CCEs used to send a Message 2 and a Message 4, respectively. 
So, a maximum of M = N/NMsg4 Message 4‚Äôs can be sent in 
one subframe if Message 2 is not present in that subframe [7]. 
When a Message 2 is sent in a subframe, then at most m = (N 
‚àí NMsg2)/NMsg4 Message 4‚Äôs can be sent in that subframe. 
Although the parameters N, NMsg2, and NMsg4 are closely 
connected from the system point of view, our model is greatly 
simplified when we use the derived parameters M and m. This 
messaging scheme is demonstrated in Figure 1. 
III. MODEL PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS 
In LTE there are K parallel Aloha channels used, and each 
time a UE makes a request of retransmission, the preamble is 
selected in random. By this random selection, the fresh 
random access requests and the retransmission attempts will 
be mixed. In addition, the input parameter of the model will be 
a, which is the aggregate rate of all requests (arrival of new 
requests and retransmission requests) not Œª, which is the rate 
of fresh requests per sub-frame. 
Let Œ∏ be defined as the throughput of successful requests. 
When the system is stable, it can be determined from the 
model as a function of a. The system is stable if the average 
input rate is the same as the average output rate, which means 
that the arrival rate Œª of fresh requests is equal to the 
throughput Œ∏ of successful requests whenever the system is 
stable. This is how we get the functional relationship between 
the aggregate request rate a and the arrival rate Œª of fresh 
requests. 
Now, let Ank represent the total number of random access 
requests with preamble k (including both the new requests and 
the retransmissions) in time slot n. Since the aggregate stream 
of requests (including the fresh ones and the retransmissions) 
is assumed to obey a Poisson process and the preambles are 
independently chosen from the uniform distribution, Ank are 
independent and identically distributed random variables 
obeying a Poisson distribution with mean ab/K and point 
probabilities, i.e., 
Pi(a) = Pr{Ank=i}=

The probability of failure can be calculated as follow: 
Pr{failure} = Pr{collision occurs in Step 1} +Pr{no collision 
occurs in Step 1, loss occurs in Step 2} +Pr{no failure occurs 
in Steps 1 and 2, delay occurs in Step 4}. 
A call flow for successful and unsuccessful session setup 
establishment based on RACH procedure is shown in Figure

A mathematical model is proposed in the form of discrete 
Markov chain that follows the steps of RACH procedure and 
describes the evolution of Message 4 buffer and determines 
the number of preamble attempt collisions and the number of 
sequential Message 3/ Message 4 transmission attempts. With 
this model the access delay for each state of the Markov chain 
can be calculated by summing up the corresponding time 
intervals introduced as follow: 
‚Ä¢ ÔÅÑ11, ÔÅÑ21, ÔÅÑ31, and ÔÅÑ41 are defined respectively as:     
waiting time for a RACH opportunity to transmit a preamble, 
preamble transmission time, preamble processing time at the 
e-NodeB, and RAR response window. Then ÔÅÑ1 = ÔÅÑ11 +ÔÅÑ21 
+ÔÅÑ31 +ÔÅÑ41  is the time interval from the beginning of RACH 
procedure until sending message 3 or resending a preamble. 
The back off window is defined as ÔÅÑ2 , the RAR processing 
time as ÔÅÑ3, and time for Message 3 transmission, waiting for 
Message 4, and Message 4 processing is ÔÅÑ4. 
Let us consider inhomogeneous discrete Markov chain {ÔÅ∏} 
over the state space 
·¥å={(0), (1), (2), (n,m), 0‚â§n‚â§N, 0‚â§m‚â§M) which determines 
the process of transitions between states. We assume that state 
(0) is the start point of RACH procedure, state (1) is the 
absorbing state denoting access success, state (2) is another 
absorbing state denoting access failure, the pair of (n,m) 
denotes the state when n Message 1 retransmissions and m 
Message 3/ Message 4 retransmissions occurred. The 
maximum number of retransmission for message 1equals (N-
1) and the maximum number of retransmission of message (2) 
(M-1). The values of (N,M) will be taken from [9]. 
The start of transmission or retransmission of message 3 
must be done after success in sending message 1. The two 
events are independent. 
Let g denote the HARQ retransmission probability for 
Message 3/ Message 4. And p is the probability of 
retransmission failure for message 1 expressed in equation (1).  
 The probability of success P in state (n, m) will be: 
ùëÉ(ùëõ, ùëö) = (1 ‚àí ùëù)(1 ‚àí ùëî)ùëùùëõùëîùëö 
(2) 
P(n,m) will be shown and calculated as a future work. 
Now, define 
     Yn (1) :=#{k : Ank = 1, k = 1, . . . , K}                          (3) 
     ≈∂n (1) :=#{k : Ank ‚â• 1, k = 1, . . . , K}                          (4) 
where ≈∂n (1) and Yn (1)  are referring to the total number of 
preambles chosen in time slot n, and the number of successful 
(uncolliding) Message 1‚Äôs respectively. The joint distribution 
of the random variables Yn (1) and ≈∂n (1) is calculated as 
follows: 
ùëûùëñùëó
(1)(ùëé) ‚âî Pr {ùëåùëõ
(1) = ùëñ, ùëåùëõ

0 ‚â§ ùëñ ‚â§ ùëó ‚â§ ùêæ 
(5) 
There is at most b Message 2‚Äôs and so at most bc UL grants 
per time slot. Message 2‚Äôs in time slot n are generated by 
Message 1‚Äôs of the previous time slot. Let ≈∂n (2) and Yn (2) 
denote the total number of UL grants included in Message 2 in 
time slot n and the number of successful (uncolliding) UL 
grants respectively. No losses appear in this step, i.e., ≈∂n (2) = 
≈∂n-1 (1) and Yn (2) = Yn-1 (1), if the total number of preambles 
chosen in the previous time slot is sufficiently small, i.e., ≈∂n-1 
(1) ‚â§ bc, which is trivially true if K ‚â§ bc. However, if ≈∂n-1 (1)> 
bc, then losses occur so that ≈∂n (2)= bc. Let the preambles that 
are given a UL grant in the latter case are chosen in random by 
e-NodeB. Thus, we have (for the nontrivial case K >bc 
ùëûùëñùëó
(2)(ùëé):=Pr{ùëåùëõ

{

 ,         0 ‚â§ ùëñ ‚â§ ùëó = ùëèùëê
  
}  
  
 
(6)
 
With the following marginal distributions: 
ùëûùëñ
(2)(ùëé) ‚âî Pr {ùëåùëõ
(2)=i}= ‚àë
ùëûùëñùëó

ùëñ=0
 
0 ‚â§ ùëó ‚â§ ùëèùëê 
(7) 
Utilizing the definition of qij

ùëûÃÉùëó

=
{

ùëó ) ùëù0(ùëé)ùêæ‚àíùëó(1 ‚àí ùëù0(ùëé))

ùëô=ùëèùëê
,   ùëó = ùëèùëê
 
(8) 
 
               So, ùëåÃÉùëõ
(2) = ùëöùëñùëõ{ùêµ(ùëé), ùëèùëê} 
where B (a) is a binomially distributed random variable 
with parameters K and 1 ‚àí p0(a). 
For throughput analysis, the throughput Œ∏ of successful 
requests must be equal to the arrival rate Œª of fresh requests. 
This proposal finds conditions for stability in terms of the 
total traffic a and then to determine the throughput of 
successful requests Œ∏ (a) as a function of a, as well as the 
maximum throughput Œ∏‚àó = maxa Œ∏ (a). To simplify the 
notation, we assume here that K >bc. The generalization to the 
case K ‚â§ bc is straightforward. 
By using the Slotted Aloha model in [8] for the RACH used 
in Step 1the throughput (per subframe) of successful Message 
1‚Äôs as a function of a, which is the arrival rate of all random 
access requests per subframe, can be calculated as follows: 
ùúÉ
(1)(ùëé) =
ùê∏ [ùëåùëõ
(1)]
ùëè
= ùëéùëí‚àíùëéùëè
ùêæ  
(9) 
To calculate the throughput in Step 2, Since K >bc, the 
throughput is then reduced by the limited number of UL grants 
in Message 2. The throughput (per subframe) of successful UL 
grants as a function of a is distinctly 
ùúÉ(2)(ùëé) =
ùê∏ [ùëåùëõ
(2)]
ùëè
= 1
ùëè ‚àë ùëñùëûùëñ
(2)(ùëé)
ùëèùëê
ùëñ=1
 
(10) 
Equations (9) and (10) can be solved using MATLAB 
software to show the throughput of message 1 and throughput 
of message 2

IV. RESULTS ANALYSIS AND VERIFICATION 
A typical values for the model parameters are taken from

    Using the above values in equations (1:10) and solving 
using MATLAB program which explained by the flowing 
flowchart in Figure 3, we get the results shown in Figures 4-6. 
 
Figure 3. Flow chart explains the steps used in MATLAP program 
 
 
Figure 4. The throughput of message 1 with the increasing the aggregate 
arrival rate a  
As shown in Figure 4 as the arrival rate for requests 
increases the throughput of message 1 increases till a certain 
value (ùúÉ(1)(ùëé) = 3.973 ) at arrival rate a =10.67 ùëüùëíùëûùë¢ùëíùë†ùë°ùë†/
ùëöùë†. Then the throughput approximately sets at this value 
because of the UE will know after a certain window time that 
the collision is occurred and retransmits message 1 again 
directly with new preamble in the uplink.     
 
Figure 5. The throughput of message 2 with the increasing the aggregate 
arrival rate a 
As shown in Figure 5, as the arrival rate for requests 
increases the throughput of message 1 increases till a certain 
value (ùúÉ(2)(ùëé) = 2.377 ) at arrival rate a =3.333 ùëüùëíùëûùë¢ùëíùë†ùë°ùë†/
ùëöùë† and then throughput decreases because the message 2 
contains information for more than one user up to 8 users and 
in case of collision lose downlink for message 2 the all users 
in this control channel will retransmit (requests) message 1 
again directly and may be have the same preamble and 
collision in message 1 dose again. 
The failure in message 2 affects directly in message 1 so to 
get the maximum throughput of message 1 and message 2, the 
intersection between throughput curve of message 2 and 
message 1 (which is the maximum throughput for message 2) 
will be considered as shown in Figure 6. 
 
 
Figure 6. The intersection between throughput of message 1and throughput of 
message 2 with the increasing the aggregate arrival rate a 
      
As shown in Figure 6, the maximum throughput is equal 
2.332 at arrival rate a equals a =3.333 ùëüùëíùëûùë¢ùëíùë†ùë°ùë†/ùëöùë† and this 
results is agree with [7].  
V. CONCLUSION 
The main aim of this paper is to obtain the upper band of 
the arrival request rate in order to sustain the network 
performance metric such as the throughput for MTC in LTE 
network. Explicit analysis for evaluation of throughput for 
message 1 and message 2 using a Markov chain model for the 
four messages signaling flow with buffering for message 4 in 
LTE 3GPP random access was presented. 
In LTE planning, it is important to take into consideration 
the requests arrival rate (as forecasting plan) and the planner 
must select the network parameters (such as the base station

locations, antennas height, etc.) to achieve the maximum 
throughput. So in this paper, it was found that, the planner has 
to design the system with arrival rate less than 3.333 
ùëüùëíùëûùë¢ùëíùë†ùë°ùë†/ùëöùë† to maximize network throughput. If the arrival 
rate increases above this value, the collisions in message 1 will 
increase, causing a degradation of the network throughput and 
also a decrease of the network performance. 
The proposed analytical model will be assigned as a future 
work to calculate the state probability by using the Markov 
chain model explained in the proposed model.
