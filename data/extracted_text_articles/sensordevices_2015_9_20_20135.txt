Abstract—Demand for detecting deep defects in the steel 
plate is increasing. We have reported a magnetic flux 
leakage testing (MFLT) system to detect deep defects and 
create magnetic imaging methods that indicate the 
backside defect. However, the developed system with one 
magnetic sensor requires XY automatic positioning stage 
and long measurement time. In this study, to realize fast 
measurement for practical use, we have developed a new 
system which can detect the magnetic field at several 
measurement points simultaneously using a multi-sensor 
array. Using the developed system, backside corrosion of 
steel plates having different depth was measured and 
two-dimensional images were created. The detected vector 
signal was analyzed by adjusting phase data. As a result, 
the developed MFLT system showed good performance of 
detection limit more than 7.2 mm in depth.

I.   INTRODUCTION 
   Defects or refuge of steel structure, such as 
infrastructure, bridge legs, power plants, and heavy 
industry pipeline cause serious accidents. As the decrepit 
infrastructures are now increasing, it is very important to 
use non-destructive testing for detecting defects as early as 
possible. Generally, it is difficult to detect the defects 
which exist in the internal or on the backside of the steel 
plate. Therefore, the detection method is required to detect 
deep defects. In the past, various types of non-destructive 
testing 
methods 
have 
been 
investigated 
such 
as 
radiographic testing [1], ultrasonic testing [2], magnetic 
flux leakage testing (MFLT) [3]-[8], and eddy current 
testing (ECT) [9]. Ultrasonic testing is affected by the 
surface state of measurement sample, and it is needed to 
contact material for testing. Radiographic testing is 
dangerous for using radiation, thus it needs expert to use. 
From the above situation, the detecting method that is easy 
operation and safe is desired. MFLT and ECT testing use 
magnetic phenomenon, thus, these methods enable 
contactless, easy operation and safe measurement. MFLT 
is applied to ferromagnetic material, such as steel and it is 
a method to detect a magnetic flux from the sample's 
surface which leaked at defects due to differences in 
permeability when an external magnetic field is applied to 
the sample. Although the conventional MFLT system is 
generally used for surface inspection [10], considering 
practice use, it is demanded that the detection of deep 
defect or backside defect. Therefore, we reported a 
two-dimensional mapping system for backside defects of a 
steel plate using MFLT. However, the system consisting of 
one channel magnetic sensor required two-dimensional 
stage to obtain the two-dimensional magnetic field 
mapping and long measurement time. In this study, we 
have developed a new system which can measure several 
magnetic signals simultaneously using a multi-sensor array 
was developed for rapid measurement. 
   Section II describes the detailed description about 
system configuration of the developed system. Section III 
describes the scheme of the experiment and the sample we 
used. Section IV describes the performance of the 
developed system was compared with the previous system 
measuring the steel plate with corrosion. Section V 
describes the conclusion. 
II.   DEVELOPED SYSTEM 
   Figure 1 shows the developed MFLT system. The 
MFLT system consists of a probe using an 8 channel AMR 
sensor array and a half-shaped yoke, a pair of excitation 
coil at both ends of the yoke, preamplifiers, a lock-in 
amplifier for phase sensitive detection (PSD), a current 
source, an oscillator, and a PC. Each AMR sensor is 
located between the both of ends of the yoke, and the 
interval of sensor is 10 mm. The liftoff between AMR 
sensor and sample surface was 1 mm. AMR sensors detect 
the y-axis component of the magnetic field which is 
parallel to both yoke ends, as shown in Figure 1. The 
current source applies an electrical current to a pair of 
induction coil with 25 turns connected to both ends of the 
yoke. AC magnetic field was induced in the sample 
between both ends of yoke. The induction coils were 
operated by sinusoidal wave of 2.5 A from the current 
source. Using a magnetic field of low frequency, eddy 
current can be ignored because the skin depth increases 
with increasing frequency. Thus, the detected magnetic 
field was mainly due to the magnetic leakage under the 
operating condition. The yoke is 10 pieces of non-oriented 
electromagnetic steel plate.  
   Figure 2 shows the previous MFLT system. The main 
difference between developed system and previous system 
is the length of the yoke. The probe consists of a 
half-shaped short yoke whose section is 10 mm × 10 mm 
and the induction coils at both ends of the yoke with 30

turns. The induction coils were operated by sinusoidal 
wave of 0.7 A from the current source. The sensor was 
placed 1 mm away from the sample surface. Both probes 
are fixed in acrylic case of nonmagnetic material not to 
affect the AMR sensors.  
 
III.   EXPERIMENT 
   The measurement samples are SS400 steel plates of 12 
mm thickness which have different depth of a backside 
corrosion. The plate had a galvanic corrosion at the center 
of the plate on the backside. The state of corrosion is 
shown in Figure 3 and Table 1 shows the detail of the 
corrosion size of samples.  
   In the developed system, one line measurement 
enables multi point measurement. Therefore, the magnetic 
field was measured in the range of 80 mm × 150 mm 
around the corrosion, as shown in Figure 4. For the 
comparison, one line measurement was executed using the 
previously developed system, and the measurement point 
was shown as white point in Figure 4.  
   The magnetic flux leakage generated from the 
backside corrosion was detected on the front surface by 
AMR sensors. The interval of measurement point was 10 
mm and the y-axis component of the magnetic field was 
measured in each system.

TABLE I.	 THE CORROSION CONDITION OF THE TEST PLATES. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Measurement points for backside corrosion. 
 
The outputs of AMR sensor were measured using a lock-in 
amplifier to detect the signal intensity and phase, which 
were synchronized with the oscillator. Overall conditions 
were adopted for each appropriate condition. Each probe 
was maintained 1 mm air gap between the yoke heads and 
the sample. Keeping the constant air gap between the yoke 
and the sample has an advantage in reproducibility 
compared with the direct contact method because of the 
non-smoothness of the sample surface due to oxidization 
and so on. 
   At each measurement point, signal intensity and phase 
was measured. Using the intensity Mmes,i and phase αi, the 
imaginary part of the signal with the common phase θ is 
calculated as follows [11].  
 
            Mimg = | Mmes,i |×sin(αi + θ )           (1) 
 
   The θ is adjusting phase which adjust shifted phase 
caused by the system phase shift and the θ depends on the 
system configuration. Thus, if an optimum θ is obtained 
by measuring a standard sample, adjustment of θ is not 
required in other measurement.  
 
IV.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
A. Basic Characteristics of Developed Sensor Array System 
Figure 5 and 6 show each system outputs curves for some 
common phase θ obtained by measurements on the steel 
plate with corrosion rate of 80 % using 10 Hz sine wave 
current. The data of Figure 5 is fifth sensor (channel 5) and 
this is the same position as that of the previous system. 
Comparing both results, each system can detect the 
magnetic flux leakage caused by the backside corrosion 
with the common phase θ = 0 degrees. The previous

system can detect the backside corrosion using above 
condition. From this result, it was found that the signal 
changes detected by the developed system are correlated to 
the backside corrosion. Even if a long yoke was used for 
applying a magnetic field, the backside corrosion could be 
curves shown in Figure 5 and 6 showed the same tendency. 
This means using long yoke enables to detect the magnetic 
flux leakage using a sensor array. Thus, a measurement 
system which can realize simultaneous measurement of 
multi lines is possible by only carrying out one line 
measurement using a sensor array. 
   However, the magnetic field generated by a long yoke 
was not constant at each position of AMR sensor. Figure 7 
shows the magnetic field distribution between the ends of 
the yoke in the air under the condition that the excitation 
coil was operated by a current of 10 Hz and 2.5 A sine 
wave. The magnetic signal was detected by each sensor. 
The magnetic signal intensity became large and the phase 
shift was small near by the ends of the yoke. In this 
condition, the magnetic image created by multi point 
measurement is affected by the distribution of the 
magnetic field. Therefore, in this measurement, to reduce 
the influence of distribution of the magnetic field, the 
reference signal vector measured with non-defect sample 
was subtracted from the measured signal vector with 
defect sample. The measurement point of reference signal 
was the center line of the non-defected samples. After that, 
the magnetic images calculated from the sbtructed signal 
vector using (1). Figure 8 shows the magnetic image 
before subtracting the reference signal (a), and after 
subtracting the reference signal (b). The corrosion rate is 
80 %. Comparing Figure 8 (a) with Figure 8 (b), the 
influence of the distribution of the magnetic field was 
reduced by subtracting the signal of non-defect sample, 
and a clear magnetic image that shows corrosion could be 
obtained.  
B.  System Optimization 
   To optimize the system, the appropriate frequency and 
common phase using 60 % corrosion rate sample was 
examined. Figure 9 shows magnetic images using a 5 Hz 
excitation frequency and various common phases and 
Figure 10 shows that using a 10 Hz and various common 
phases. Magnetic images with a common phase 0° showed 
the clearest corrosion image, and magnetic images with 5 
Hz shows the presence of the backside corrosion more 
clearly than that of 10 Hz. This means that the magnetic

field penetrated inside the steel plate increased with 
decreasing the frequency due to the skin effect, and the 
depth of penetrated magnetic signal with 10 Hz decreased 
compared to that with 5 Hz. Therefore, the optimum 
condition was determined as the frequency is 5 Hz and 
common phase is 0°. 
C.  Evaluation of Depth Profile  
   To evaluate the developed system under the optimum 
condition, we measured magnetic images using the steel 
plates which have different corrosion rate. The excitation 
coils were operated with 5 Hz and 2.5 A sine wave from a 
current source and the common phase was 0°. For all 
samples, one line measurement was performed and 
magnetic signal was measured by 8 sensors. Using the 
detected magnetic signals, the magnetic images of the 
samples with different corrosion rates of 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 
and 80 % were obtained.  
   Figure 11 shows the result of magnetic images. The 
images show the existence of the corrosion and it becomes 
clear with increasing the actual corrosion rate of more than 
40%. On the other hand, the magnetic images with the 
corrosion rate of 10 and 20 % show unclear images. These 
unclear images derived from that the magnetic flux 
leakage did not leak enough when the magnetic field was 
applied at the sample with low corrosion, and the 
difference of signal intensity between corrosion part and 
healthy part was small.  
   Next, we examined to evaluate the relation between 
the change of the magnetic field intensity and corrosion 
rates quantitatively. The change of the magnetic field 
which is along the dotted line in the Figure 12 (a) is shown 
in Figure 12 (b). The changes of each corrosion rate of 10, 
20, 40, 50, 60, and 80% are shown. The ΔB is defined as 
the subtracted value between the maximum and minimum 
values for each sample as shown in Figure 12 (b). The 
value of ΔB increased according to the increase of the 
corrosion rates. Comparing ΔB with the magnetic image of 
10, 20 %, the magnetic images are unclear and the change 
of the ΔB for 10 % and 20 % changed little. Therefore, 
more than 40 % corrosion rate can be detected using the 
developed system. This corresponds to the depth of 
approximately 7.2 mm from the surface of the front. 
Figure 13 shows the relation between the depth of defect 
and ΔB.  The ΔB was chosen thinning rate are 80, 60, 50, 
40 % which are ΔB clearly changes. ΔB decreased with the 
increment of the depth of the defect. Using the magnetic 
image and ΔB, we can survey the backside defect's size 
and depth.

   To improve detecting ability for deep corrosion, it is 
required to gain the enough magnetic flux leakage due to 
the backside corrosion by increasing the applied magnetic 
field. To realize this, appressing the sensor probe to a steel 
plate will be effective to reduce the dispersion of the 
magnetic flux leakage signals which is derived from the 
fluctuation of lift-off and leakage of the magnetic flux to 
the outside. 
 
V.   CONCLUSIONS 
   A new MFLT system with a multi-sensor array for 
practical use was developed. Arraying the sensors enabled 
reducing positioning time to settle the sensor probe and 
sensors, and the system enabled rapid detection of 
backside defect. When the magnetic field of low frequency 
was applied, it was possible to detect the deepest defect. In 
addition, the stronger magnetic field could detect the deep 
defect. Under these optimized conditions, the developed 
system showed good detection limit more than 7.2 mm in 
depth.
