Abstract—Online 
network-based 
transactions 
are 
widespread forms of transactions in e-commerce markets 
such as peer-to-peer markets or smart media markets. In 
these markets, the participants need criteria to search, 
select and manage their partners. One of the most 
important criteria is the trustworthiness of the partner. 
The participants aim to enhance the probability of being 
selected by their opponents through signaling their 
trustworthiness levels to their opponents. Simultaneously, 
the opponents adjust their beliefs on the trustworthiness 
of other participants based on observation of signals. This 
paper describes this situation using a signaling game in 
which the seller sends a signal of his/her trust level and 
the buyer decides his/her payment schedule for the 
presented signal. The results of the equilibrium analyses 
suggest criteria for the signaling of the cost structures of 
participants and the market environment. Additionally, 
the results of the simulations validate the results of the 
equilibrium analyses.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Autonomous 
agents 
in 
the 
network-based 
transaction market need criteria to search for other 
participants, select partners and manage relationships. 
One of the most important criteria is the trustworthiness 
of the partner. Network-based transaction markets such 
as e-commerce, peer-to-peer markets, business-to-
customer markets, and business-to-business markets 
often only provide information goods [1]. Information 
goods have the characteristics of experience goods, 
whose quality is difficult to observe in advance, but can 
be 
ascertained 
with 
experience 
[2]. 
Therefore, 
information asymmetry is one of the main focuses of 
many studies that deal with information goods. 
Many studies have attempted to mitigate the 
negative effects of information asymmetry. Researchers 
have investigated various mechanisms that evaluate the 
level of trustworthiness of an agent in the network, such 
as 
reputation, 
recommendation 
and 
third party 
authorization [3]. For example, web recommendation 
systems [4] and trust certification stamp systems [5] are 
kinds of mechanisms that have been developed to 
manage trust among a number of unspecified agents in 
the internet. These previous efforts, however, have 
focused more on enhancing the accuracy of prediction 
by developing sophisticated prediction mechanisms. 
The signal resulting from these mechanisms is also 
asymmetric, so that an agent has to adjust his/her belief 
about the trustworthiness of the opponent based on the 
results of observation. 
This paper describes this situation as a signaling 
game in which the seller (or the sender) sends the signal 
of his/her trust level and the buyer (or the receiver) 
decides his/her payment schedule for the presented 
signal. This paper also presents the criteria of the 
signaling cost structures of participants and the market 
environment. Satisfying these criteria ensures the 
effectiveness of signals in distinguishing each type of 
participant and the stability of the separating 
equilibrium. Through these processes, this paper also 
investigates fundamental rules of trust signaling games 
in network-based market transactions. Additionally, it 
also uses an agent-based simulation to validate whether 
these rules are effective in the market for agents that 
mimic bounded-rational human behavior. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
The next section reviews the related literature. Section 3 
proposes the trust signaling model. Section 4 conducts 
an equilibrium analysis of the trust signaling game. 
Section 5 validates the theoretical model using an 
agent-based simulation. Finally, Section 6 provides a 
discussion and conclusion. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Akerlof [6] discussed the problem of information 
asymmetry and quality uncertainty in the market for 
used cars. Spence [7] also considered the issue of 
information 
asymmetry 
between 
employers 
and 
employees in his pioneering work. He suggested that 
the employers use employees’ education levels as 
signals and offer wage schedules on the basis of their 
beliefs about labor productivity. Spence’s model offers 
a theoretical framework that can describe many kinds of 
signaling games. This model could be used to describe 
social relationships based on the trustworthiness signal. 
Several recent studies have focused on interactions 
between autonomous agents in the network using game 
theory, particularly signaling games. One of these 
studies applied game theory to detect intrusion by 
malicious nodes in a mobile ad hoc network without 
107

centralized control [8]. This study provides insights 
regarding the attacker in the network and the intrusion 
detection system by modeling the interaction between 
normal nodes and attackers as a basic Bayesian game. 
Another study of mobile ad hoc networks focused on 
the best strategies that normal nodes and malicious 
nodes can select in a dynamic Bayesian signaling game. 
It validated the superiority of the suggested strategy and 
concluded that restricting the opportunity for malicious 
nodes to flee from detection is important [9]. 
The mechanisms supporting the decision making 
about whether one can trust an opponent in network 
transactions have been considered in various studies 
over a long period of time. Reputation mechanisms 
have become a fairly common framework since several 
pioneering studies [10] [11] and subsequent studies [12]. 
One subsequent study suggested that the reputation 
mechanism of the previous opponents of a player offers 
feedback information about previous transactions; the 
autonomous system aggregates these feedback with 
proper weights and then the system offers more 
accurate evaluation of the opponents’ trustworthiness 
[13]. 
Another study compared simulation analysis and 
theoretical analysis. It suggested that while game theory 
can analyze the behavior of rational agents, agent-based 
simulations can analyze the behavior of software agents 
that mimic real-life decision makers [14]. 
III. MODEL DESCRIPTION 
In the simplest signaling game, there are two 
players—the sender and the receiver—in the set I. The 
sender can be either malicious type (M type) or normal 
type (N type). The receiver can only be regular type (R 
type). The set of types is denoted by T: T=TS×TR, 
TS={M,N}, TR={R}. The type of sender is chosen by 
nature and is the private information of the sender. Each 
player has a strategy set A and a utility set u. Therefore, 
the structure of the game is simply denoted by: 
G={I,Ti} ∈
i
I,{P(·|·)} ∈
i
I,{Ai} ∈
i
I,{ui} ∈
i
I } 
The prior probability that the sender is M type or N 
type is π(Malicioius)=πM or π(Normal)=1−πM. The 
sender of a particular type sends a message m 
(m:T→M) about his/her level of trustworthiness to a 
receiver. The message is drawn from the set M={e,0}. 
The receiver receives this signal, and then takes an 
action drawn from a set A. This action a (a:M→A) 
indicates the value that the receiver is willing to pay to 
sender, w. The values of w forms the strategy set 
A={w|w∈R+}. The payoff of player i is given by the 
function ui:T×M×A→R. This means that the payoff of a 
player is decided by the player type, the message of a 
sender and the action of a receiver. 
In our example, M type and N type senders receive 
the payoffs v+L and v (v, L≥0) when the transaction is 
successful. The receiver receives payoffs of –(v+L) if 
he/she transacts with an M type sender and v if he/she 
transacts with an N type sender. 
The receiver cannot observe the type of transacting 
sender; therefore, the sender uses a certain form of 
signal to increase the probability that the receiver 
chooses him/her as a partner or increase the payoff from 
a successful transaction. The signal can take various 
forms such as the disclosure of a transaction history, 
presentation of a certification from a third party 
authority, or advertising. Most of these signals involve a 
cost. For example, if a sender wants to signal by 
disclosing a transacting history, he/she cannot violate 
the transaction rules for a given period even if he/she is 
the M type sender. One can easily imagine that this 
form of signal costs more for the M type sender than for 
the N type sender. Some forms of signal may involve an 
equal cost for the M xtype and the N type senders. 
However, it is likely that the receiver will be unable to 
distinguish one type from another if the signal costs of 
obtaining the same level of trustworthiness for two 
types of senders are the same. Therefore, we assume 
that the cost of an M type sender is relatively higher 
than that of an N type sender. 
The sender advertises his/her own type honestly or 
deceitfully by sending a certain level of message  
e∈[0,∞) that appears to represent the trustworthy level. 
The message e costs cM(e) for the M type sender and  
cN(e) for the N type sender. Then the receiver suggests 
the fee schedule w(e) that the receiver wants to pay to 
ensure a trust-based transaction with the sender. 
Therefore, the expected payoff of the M type sender is 
uM(e)=v+L+w(e)−cM(e) and uN(e)=v+w(e)−cN(e) for 
the N type sender when the transaction is successful. 
The potential receivers are assumed to be 
sufficiently many and to be risk neutral so that they 
suggest a wage schedule that has the same value of 
expected profit for a transaction and satisfies the zero 
profit condition of the competitive market providers 
[15]. Therefore, the receiver suggests the fee  
w(µe)=v−µe(2v+L) to ensure a trust-based transaction 
when he/she has observed the message e from the 
sender and has the belief µe  that the sender is an M type. 
Of course, the receiver does not participate unless  
µe <v/(2v+L). 
IV. EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS 
A. Separating Equilibrium 
 
Proposition 1. When the level of trustworthiness of a 
participant is used as the signal, the signal can be 
effective in distinguishing one sender from another if 
the cost of trust level signaling is sufficiently distinct. 
 
Proposition 1 indicates that the presented signal 
gives perfect information of the type of sender if the 
two sender types select distinct levels of trustworthiness 
as their signals in the equilibrium. When eM and eN are 
the selected signals in the equilibrium of the M type 
sender and the N type sender, cM(eM)=eM and 
cN(eN)=γeN are the cost of signaling of each type of 
108

sender (where 0<γ<1), and w(eM) and w(eN) are the fee 
schedules, and the separating signaling equilibrium

(4) 
For the above conditions, in the separating 
equilibrium, the receiver believes that the sender is M 
type (or N type) with probability one when he/she 
observes the signal eM (or eN). Therefore, the values of  
w(eM) and w(eN) are 0 and v in accordance with the 
assumption of zero profit. Furthermore, the expected 
payoff of the M type sender is v+L−eM
* and for the N 
type sender it is 2v−γeN
*. It is clear that eM
*=0 is the 
best choice of the M type sender. For the N type sender, 
e=0 is the best choice and the payoff is only equal to v 
if he/she selects e satisfying e≠eN
* and the receiver has 
belief µe=1 for all e other than e*. Therefore, the N type 
sender does not have an incentive to leave the 
separating equilibrium when the following condition is 
satisfied: 2v−γeN
*≥v, that is, eN
*≤v/γ. 
If the M type sender wants to leave the separating 
equilibrium, selecting eN
* as the signal is the best choice. 
However, the receiver’s belief is µeN*=0 in this situation 
so that the receiver offers only the value v as the fee for 
the trust-based transaction and the M type sender 
obtains the payoff 2v+L−eN
*. Therefore, the M type 
sender does not have an incentive to leave the 
equilibrium when the following condition is satisfied: 
2v+L−eN
*≤v+L, that is, eN
*≥v. 
The meaning of condition (4) is clear. To ensure the 
existence of the separating equilibrium in which the M 
type sender does not send any signal and the N type 
sender sends a positive signal, eN
* has to be sufficiently 
high so that the M type sender cannot pretend to be the 
N type sender and coincidently cannot to be so high that 
the N type sender cannot afford the signaling cost. In 
the separating equilibrium, the utility-maximizing N 
type sender selects eN
*=v as the best choice. 
What one has to focus on is that the signaling cost 
structures of the two types of senders have to be distinct. 
However, one has to consider that not every form of 
signal ensures a distinct cost structure for the two types 
of senders. 
 
B. Pooling Equilibrium 
 
Proposition 2. The pooling equilibrium in which the 
two types of senders select the same trustworthy level as 
a signal is not stable if the signaling cost structure is 
distinct. 
 
If the sender cannot send any signal, the receiver 
believes that the probability that the sender is the M 
type sender is prior probability πM. The receiver 
participates in the transaction and suggests the fee for a 
trust-based transaction of πM<v/(2v+L) so that all types 
of senders take w as the fee. Similarly, if the two types 
of senders select the same signal e* as their 
trustworthiness level, the receiver cannot obtain any 
information regarding the type of sender. In this 
situation, the belief of the receiver is the same as the 
prior probability that the sender is the M type sender. 
Furthermore, the signal e, other than e*, must satisfy the 
following conditions.

Therefore, the receiver suggests the fee schedule 
w*=v−πM(2v+L) when he/she observes e*. The M type 
sender receives the payoff uM(e,w)=2v+L−πM(2v+L)–e* 
and 
the 
N 
type 
sender 
receives 
the 
payoff  
uN(e,w)=2v−πM(2v+L)–γe*. To ensure the pooling 
equilibrium in which the two types of senders select the 
same signal, the payoff from selecting e must not be 
higher than the payoff that resulted from selecting e*. 
Therefore, the following two inequalities have to be 
satisfied: (2v+L)(1−πM)–e*≥(2v+L)(1−µe)−e as the 
payoff condition of the M type sender, and 
2v(1−πM)−πML−γe*≥2v(1−µe)−µeL−γe as the payoff 
condition of the N type sender. 
The M type sender has an incentive to leave the 
pooling equilibrium if the belief of the receiver is 
µe≤v/(2v+L) and the condition (2v+L)(1−πM)−e*<v+L–
e is satisfied. The N type sender has a similar incentive. 
In the pooling equilibrium, the receiver always has 
the belief µe=v/(2v+L), so that e=0 is the best choice for 
the any type of sender if the sender leaves the pooling 
equilibrium. The M type and N type senders take v+L 
and v as their payoff from the transaction. Therefore, all 
types of senders do not have an incentive to leave the 
109

equilibrium if the following two inequalities are 
satisfied: 
(2v+L)(1−πM)−e*≥v+L 
and  
2v(1−πM)−πML−γe*≥v. 
Therefore, the pooling equilibrium is where the two 
types of senders select the same signal, e* for all e* that 
satisfy e*≤v−πM(2v+L). The receiver believes that the 
sender is the M type with probability one when he/she 
observes a lower signal than e* and expects the type of 
the sender in accordance with the prior probability 
when he/she observes a higher signal than e*. 
However, this situation is not rational because the 
two types of senders obtain (1−πM)(2v+L) and 
2v−πM(2v+L) when they do not send any signal and the 
equilibrium payoffs are less than the no-signal payoffs. 
Therefore, the pooling equilibrium is not stable. 
Figure 1 illustrates how the optimal choice of a 
sender changes by comparing the fees and the costs of 
trustworthy transactions by the level of signals.

signals. 
C. The Existence Condition of the Equilibrium 
 
Proposition 
3. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
trustworthiness 
level signaling 
depends 
on 
the 
proportion of malicious type participants in the market. 
 
When the two types of sender cannot send any 
signals, they obtain (1−πM)(2v+L) and 2v−πM(2v+L) 
for each type of sender. For the N type sender, the 
strategy that he/she sends the equilibrium signal gives a 
better payoff than the strategy that he/she does not send 
any signal if the following inequality is satisfied: 
2v−γeN
*>2v−πM(2v+L), that is, πM > eN
*/(2v+L). This 
condition becomes πM>γv/(2v+L) in accordance with 
the separating equilibrium condition. This means that 
the proportion of M type senders must be higher than a 
certain level so that N type senders do not achieve a 
better outcome when they are treated as average senders 
including M type senders. Additionally, the receiver 
wants to transact with the sender if the condition 
πM<v/(2v+L) is satisfied. 
Therefore, the existence condition of equilibrium is 
the following inequality.

(7) 
The most important factor in equation (7) is gamma. 
Gamma is the signaling cost ratio of the N type sender 
to the M type sender. The range of the proportion of the 
M type senders in the market increases as gamma 
increases. 
For example, if the value obtained from a trust-
ensured transaction, v, is equal to one for the receiver 
and equal to one for the N type sender and the value 
extorted from a deceitful transaction, v+L is two (one 
plus one), then the equilibrium can exist when the 
proportion of M type senders is less than 1/3. 
Furthermore, if there exists a third party authority and it 
charges the M type sender twice the higher cost for 
certification of the same level of trustworthiness, the 
trust signaling can be effective when the proportion of 
M type senders is greater than 1/6. 
V. AGENT-BASED SIMULATION AND RESULTS 
A. The Simulation Description 
This section validates the results of the equilibrium 
analysis. While the theoretical analysis assumes rational 
agents, the agent-based simulation assumes that agents 
have bounded rationality, which helps us understand the 
behaviors of real-life decision makers. 
The agents that participate in the virtual market are 
bounded-rational receivers and senders. The signal 
senders are sellers that have perfect information of their 
own goods and their types. The signal receivers are 
buyers and they do not have sufficient information 
about the goods and the sellers’ types. While there are 
numerous senders and receivers in the virtual market, 
their searching and comparing capabilities are also 
bounded so that they can search and compare only a 
few opponents. Every agent has his/her own type, 
selects a strategy by simple heuristics, and amends the 
previous strategy by evaluating the payoff resulting 
from the previous transaction. This is a process with 
behavioral elements similar to that suggested by some 
studies analyzing artificial intelligence. 
The senders are one of two types as in the 
equilibrium analysis. The N type senders prefer to 
maintain the rules of the transaction and the M type 
senders prefer not to keep the rules. These senders want 
to increase the probability that they are selected as a 
partner of the receiver by sending a proper signal. The 
senders use the derivative follower algorithm that an 
agent changes their strategy based on the presented 
profit. This algorithm has been often used as the pricing 
algorithm of producers in the analysis of artificial 
intelligence or electronic commerce [15]. Specifically, 
 
110

the sender changes the signal in the same direction until 
the current profit drops below the profit observed in the 
previous period and the previous profit also drops 
below the profit observed in the period before previous 
period. With these basic heuristics, the senders use 
additional algorithms. One of them is that although the 
net profit tends to increase, the agent may decrease the 
signal when one expects the additional profit to 
decrease with the signal. The signal cannot be negative. 
In the simulation, the receivers are of two types. The 
first type of receiver prefers to transact with the sender 
who sends the highest signal among those agents 
searched by the receiver. The second type of receiver 
prefers to minimize the fee cost of ensuring a 
trustworthy transaction. 
The first type of receiver thinks that the sender who 
has the highest signal is the N type sender, so that 
he/she pays the expected value that can be obtained 
from the transaction with the N type sender as the fee 
for the trustworthy transaction. If the searched signals 
are all of similar magnitudes, the receiver pays the 
expected value that can be obtained from the transaction 
with the average sender using the prior probability that 
the sender is an M type sender. These two types of 
receivers make decisions based on the presented signals 
and the transaction value v. Additionally, the receiver 
cannot punish the malicious agent. 
Each run of simulation has 200 iterations. The 
population proportion of malicious senders in the entire 
population of senders varies from 0.05 to 1 for 
comparing the utility changes and checking simulation 
sensitivity. 
The 
population 
proportion 
of 
cost 
minimizing receivers in the entire receivers is set to 0.5. 
The gamma which means the ratio of signaling costs of 
two types of senders is set to 1/3 and one. The value of 
a good and the benefit of a sender by extortion from 
receiver are normalized to one. The simulation 
parameters are described in Table 1.

While the base value of malicious sender’s signal is 
zero, 20% of malicious senders are set the initial values 
of signals to one in order to pretend to be normal 
senders as shown in Table 1. Oppositely, 20% of 
normal receivers are set their initial signals to zero in 
order to minimize their signaling costs while other 
receivers are set their initial signal to one. The signals 
are normally distributed with a mean of one or zero and 
a standard deviation of 0.025 to distinguish each 
individual signal. The signals vary stepwise with the 
derivative follower algorithm; the size of the step is 0.1. 
This value means 10 % of initial value of normal 
sender’s signal. 
B. The Simulation Results 
Figure 2 illustrates the simulation results of the 
signal changes of two types of senders for various 
periods. The signals of the two types seem to converge 
before the 20th period; however, they finally diverge to 
around 1 and below 0.2 and become stabile.

From equation (7), we expect that the separating 
equilibrium such as in Figure 2 exists in the range from 
1/9 to 1/3 for the given parameters in this simulation. 
The simulation results of Table 2 indicate that if M 
type senders increase to 40 percent of total senders, 
over 80 percent of receivers take losses.

The simulation results of Table 3 indicate that if the

total sum of utilities in this situation is less than in the 
no-signaling situation.

that the M type senders increase their signal more than 
the N type senders, as indicated in Figure 3.

C. The Comparison with Equilibrium Analysis 
Satisfying the criteria suggested by the results of the 
equilibrium analysis ensures the effectiveness of signals 
in distinguishing each type of participant and the 
stability of the separating equilibrium. First, to 
distinguish each type of participant on the basis of their 
signal, the signaling cost has to be distinct for each type 
to a certain extent. Second, the equilibrium that all types 
of participants select the same level of trust as their 
signal is not stable. Third, the effectiveness of 
distinction on the basis of the signal is affected by the 
revealed proportions of sender types. 
The results of the simulation analysis validate the 
results of the equilibrium analysis and ascertain that the 
fundamental rules of the theoretical analysis are 
generally observed in the agent-based simulation in 
which bounded-rational agents interact with each other. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper described the situation in which agents 
search, transact and manage their partners in network-
based transactions based on trustworthiness signals and 
tried to formalize the fundamental rules of this situation 
using game theory, particularly the signaling game. In 
the situation described in this paper, the seller sends a 
signal of his/her trust level and the buyer decides his/her 
payment schedule for the presented signal. The results 
of the equilibrium analyses suggest the criteria of the 
signaling cost structures of participants and the market 
environment. 
Additionally, 
the 
results 
of 
the 
simulations validate the results of the equilibrium 
analyses. 
However, this paper has the limitation as it only 
tried to find several fundamental rules. It only 
ascertained that the trust signaling cost structures of the 
different types of agents have to be distinguished from 
each other and did not suggest specific mechanisms. 
Therefore, future research should focus on specific 
mechanisms such as certification of third party authority 
and suggest an extended signaling game in which 
various types of agents interact with each other.
