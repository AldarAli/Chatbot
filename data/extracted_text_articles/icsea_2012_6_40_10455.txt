Abstract—This paper describes a system from software 
application 
research, 
development, 
implementation 
and 
testing. The final software tool is a web-based application used 
as a finance module by SMEs within the FutureSME portal, 
which supports small and medium companies for better 
competition on the market. The finance module offers three 
bankruptcy and financial standing models for evaluation of 
their financial health. The results are crucial for their ability to 
get a loan from banks. The self-assessment way of getting 
results does not require any advisor or bank representative. 
The described tool was used in practice by partnering 
companies. 
Keywords–finance module; financial health; bankrupcy 
model;  financial standing model;  SME.
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
Nowadays, every SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) is 
in a situation when a loan is needed for future development, 
expansion or research. It is a long process to get the desired 
amount of money in a company’s bank account. A company 
needs to hire a financial consultant or contact a bank directly. 
They have to fill out several forms. They have to expose 
their financial health to many people, which could be 
sometimes insecure, as when the company is in red numbers 
and crucial information leaked out to the public could cause 
a real problem. Why not use tools that are utilized by banks 
and use them by a company itself? We would like to research 
all available tools for stating a company’s health and focus 
on creating a tool that would be accessible via the 
FutureSME portal and every SME will be able to get its 
financial health status by filling all requested data in a form 
and the system will process and generate results. Input data 
should be in the form of a profit & loss report and/or balance 
sheet. We would like to apply more than one financial 
model. The overall result will be presenting a well arranged 
table with simply expressed results colored or highlighted 
according to the current company’s health status. 
 
II. 
SMES ANALYSIS AND REQUIREMENTS 
At the first phase of the FutureSME project, a long 
analysis was carried out by all FutureSME R&D partners [2, 
5]. The academic research focused on emerging technologies 
and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) 
standards and methods suitable to be used for SMEs [2, 5, 
17], the industrial partners of the project were surveyed 
during seminars and panels organized by the project 
Consortium. The results, also published in several case 
studies [7], helped us to focus on financial models [1, 14, 16] 
and to choose those that are frequently used by banks and 
other financial institutions. Also this helped to determine a 
customer’s solvency [8, 15], then to select the most suitable 
form and content to deliver our implementation in order to 
have it accepted by SMEs in their daily practice, and finally, 
to create an application using tools for web publishing. 
III. 
FINANCIAL MODELS 
All development and programming has a very powerful 
theoretical background in the financial area. We had been 
searching for usable models related to a company’s 
profitability and bankruptcy, which would correspond to 
SMEs specifications. Based on the requirements collected 
during the analytical phase of the project [2, 5], such as 
keeping the entry data simple, using the same company’s 
data available for shareholders and/or annual reports, being 
easy to operate by not technically skilled SME staff and 
similar areas, we selected three models – two models for 
profitability – Kralicek’s quick test [14] and the DuPont 
analysis [10] and one bankruptcy model – Altman’s Z-Score 
model [1]. Our research confirmed that Kralicek’s quick test 
is robust method utilizing whole potential of balance sheet 
and profit & loss report. DuPont analysis was chosen as it is 
a great tool to show the typical employee, who has little or 
no financial and accounting background, on how their work 
and efforts impacts the financial results of their company. 
Altman’s Z-Score model is a common simple and accurate 
calculation used by investors and plays a relatively easy 
addition to an investment checklist.  
There are many evaluation tools using these models 
Kralicek’s Online Quick Test [13], DuPont Financial 
Analysis - Easy Calculator [4] and Altman Z-Score 
Spreadsheet [11], but they are separated standalone utilities 
requesting almost same input data. We need just one 
comprehensive application on the portal sharing common

input data for all analyses. User interface must be created 
for various types of SMEs, so the final application is generic 
and each company works with paragraphs and fields that are 
relevant for them.  
A. Kralicek‘s quick test 
This test was created by Professor Kralicek in 1991. This 
test uses an annual report (profit & loss report and balance 
sheet) and calculates ratio indicators and each of them gets a 
grade from various perspectives – capital strength, 
indebtedness, profitability and financial position; see Table 
1. This test has four partial results and one overall result 
[14]. 
Equity Ratio = Total Owner's Equity / Total Assets 
 
Debt Settlement Period from Cash Flow = (Liabilities - 
Cash) / Cash Flow)  
 
   
   
  
Cash Flow = P/L Acc. Period + Assets Depreciation + 
Reserves and Deferred Income 
 
Operating Cash Flow / Sales = Operating Cash Flow / Net 
Sales (Revenue) - This ratio, which is expressed as a 
percentage, compares a company's operating cash flow to its 
net sales or revenues, which gives investors an idea of the 
company's ability to turn sales into cash. 
 
ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Income / Total Assets - An 
indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total 
assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management 
is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by 
dividing a company's annual earnings by its total assets, 
ROA is displayed as a percentage. Sometimes this is 
referred to as "return on investment" [9]. 
If we get a grade 1 or 2, our company is profitable [14]; 
otherwise a company is threatened by bankruptcy. 
B. DuPont Analysis 
DuPont analysis (also known as the DuPont identity, 
DuPont equation, DuPont model or the DuPont method) is

an expression which breaks ROE (Return On Equity) into 
three parts. The name comes from the DuPont Corporation 
that started using this formula in the 1920s [10]. 
 
ROE = (Profit margin) * (Asset turnover) * (Equity 
multiplier) 
= (Net Profit/Sales) * (Sales/Assets) * (Assets/Equity) = 
(Net Profit/Equity) 
The DuPont identity breaks down Return on Equity (that 
is the returns that investors receive from the firm) into three 
distinct elements. This analysis enables the analyst to 
understand the source of superior (or inferior) return by 
comparison with companies in similar industries (or between 
industries). The DuPont identity, however, is less useful for 
some industries, such as investment banking, that do not use 
certain concepts or for which the concepts are less 
meaningful. Variations may be used in certain industries, as 
long as they also respect the underlying structure of the 
DuPont identity. The DuPont analysis relies upon the 
accounting identity, that is, a statement (formula) that is by 
definition true. 
C. Altmans Z-Score model 
The Z-Score formula for predicting bankruptcy was 
published in 1968 by Edward I. Altman, who was at the time 
an Assistant Professor of Finance at New York University. 
The formula may be used to predict the probability that a 
firm will go into bankruptcy within two years. Z-scores are 
used to predict corporate defaults and an easy-to-calculate 
control measure for the financial distress status of companies 
in academic studies. The Z-Score uses multiple corporate 
income and balance sheet values to measure the financial 
health of a company. The Z-Score is a linear combination of 
four or five common business ratios, weighted by 
coefficients. The coefficients were estimated by identifying a 
set of firms which had declared bankruptcy and then 
collecting a matched sample of firms which had survived, 
matching them by industry and approximate size (assets) [1]. 
 
Z-Score definitions: 
    X1 = Working Capital / Total Assets 
    X2 = Retained Earnings / Total Assets 
    X3 = Earnings before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets 
    X4 = Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities 
    X5 = Sales/ Total Assets 
 
Z-Score bankruptcy model: 
    Z = 1.2X1 + 1.4X2 + 3.3X3 + 0.6X4 + .999X5 
 
Zones of Discrimination: 
    Z > 2.99 - Safe Zone 
    1.81 < Z < 2.99 - Grey Zone 
    Z < 1.81 - Bankruptcy Zone

SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION 
Our final software tool is called “Finance Module” and is 
implemented into the FutureSME portal; see Fig. 1.

Figure 1.  
FutureSME portal 
 
This portal, as the deliverable of the FutureSME project, 
supports SMEs for their better competitiveness on the market 
and, once they log in, offers them free tools to be used for 
improvement of their business and managing the company 
transformation 
dependent on 
the 
changing 
business 
environment they must face. 
Our Finance Module offers them to get their financial 
grades and check their ability to get a loan from a bank 
without any further consultancy help, just by filling out their 
Profit & Loss report and Balance Sheet data; see Fig. 2. 
All entered data are processed on the server and then the 
final reports with results from all three financial models 
applied using common source data are produced. Just a 
moment after all data are entered results are generated and 
presented in the form of simple tables; see Fig. 3, 4 and 5. 
The final software application is in a form of a webpage. It is 
programmed in PHP and uses java script for client-side 
scripting and the Microsoft SQL server for data storing. All 
input data are related to a company and an analysis. A 
company is defined by its name, description and type 
(privately or publicly held). Once a company is stored the 
user is allowed to create a new analysis. Every analysis is 
related to a business year. Then, data from the profit & loss 
and balance sheet are required. There is a cash flow form as 
well but its data are not mandatory for final results 
generation. 
The balance sheet always requests data from the analysis 
year and two previous years. It is divided into four areas – 
the director’s loan, fixed assets, current assets and accruals

and deferred expenditure. The areas have their own areas and 
subareas. The user is supposed to fill out either subareas or 
total numbers. While data are being updated, the results are 
changing in real time, and there is no need of starting a 
process. The user only needs to choose a particular model 
and to click that tab to get the results. 
Model results are presented by a table with highlighted 
numbers according to the particular status. Mostly green, 
amber and red colors are used. The data used in this paper 
are provided by one of our partnering companies for testing. 
The company’s name is not published. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The goal of this research has been reached. A new 
Finance Module was developed and implemented into the 
FutureSME portal. The module was tested by partnering 
companies and external SMEs as well. The final version of 
the application was accommodated according to their 
comments. Companies reviewed this tool as very useful and 
163

helpful when a loan is needed or simply when they want to 
determine their company’s health or development from 
previous years during current situation into the future. The 
Finance Module is offered to all registered users of the 
FutureSME portal and its use is free of charge. A user 
manual is included and is accessible via the program menu.
