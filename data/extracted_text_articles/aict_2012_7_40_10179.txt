Abstract—The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is 
one of the widely used modulation techniques in the broadband 
wireless technology. One of the main problems is the high 
peak-to-average power ratio of transmitted signal due to the 
superposition of many subcarriers. This paper presents a new 
hybrid peak-to-average power ratio reduction technique, 
which combines a partial transmit sequence method with the 
clipping method. The paper highlights the performance and 
advantages of the mixed technique and compares it with other 
existing methods.  The simulations shown that the proposed 
technique realizes an increased peak-to-average power ratio 
with a decreased signal distortion compared to clipping 
method.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(OFDM) is used in broadband wireless communication 
systems like Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access (WiMAX), Terrestrial Digital Video Broadcast 
(DVB-T), or wireline systems like Asymmetric Digital 
Subscriber Line (ADSL). The main problem of the OFDM is 
the high value of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of 
the transmitted signal. Due to the superposition of the many 
data subcarriers, the OFDM signal exhibits Rayleigh-like 
characteristics. The large amplitude variations lead to high 
values for the PAPR. These peaks require the high power 
amplifiers (HPA) to support wide linear dynamic range. 
Higher signal level at the input of HPA causes non-linear 
distortions at its output, leading to an inefficient operation of 
HPA. These distortions cause intermodulation products 
resulting unwanted out-of-band power. In order to reduce the 
PAPR of OFDM signals, many solutions have been proposed 
and analyzed. Some of the main characteristics of these 
methods are non-linearity, computation complexity and size 
of side information needed to be sent to receiver. 
Some of the well known linear methods are selective 
mapping (SLM) [1], partial transmit sequence (PTS) [2], and 
tone reservation (TR) [5]. 
In the SLM method, the vectors from the original 
frequency domain OFDM signal are rotated based on a set of 
predefined phase arrays. For each signal variant obtained, its 
corresponding PAPR is evaluated. The one with the lowest 
PAPR is chosen for the transmission. 
The PTS method uses a similar principle with the 
difference that same rotation angle is applied to more than 
one vector. The method considers the N complex values 
representing OFDM signal vectors as being grouped into K 
sub-blocks of N/K elements each. The case of blocks with 
contiguous carriers has the advantage of simplicity and is 
more suitable for detection systems. The case of non-
contiguous carrier blocks offers better peak factor (PF) 
reduction capability at the cost of extra complexity.  
The method generates a set of signal variants by rotating the 
vectors from each block with one phase from a given set of 
K phases with values from a given finite set. Then, after 
calculation of the corresponding PAPR of each signal 
variant, the one with minimal PAPR is being chosen for the 
transmission.  
The efficiency of these methods increases with the 
number of phases from the considered set. The efficiency of 
the PTS method also increases when a higher number of 
blocks are used. The disadvantage is that a better efficiency 
requires an increased amount of computation at the 
transmitter’s side and receiver’s side. Because the receiver 
must know those phases’ sets and block sizes, another 
drawback of these methods is the additional information 
required to be sent to receiver. Optimizations of those 
methods have been proposed in several papers [3, 4]. 
The TR method represents another linear technique 
which instead of altering the existing data subcarriers 
modifies the vectors from an additional set of non-data 
subcarriers. The method calculates the signal’s PAPR values 
which correspond to the allocated reserved subcarriers. The 
signal replica corresponding to minimal PAPR is chosen for 
the transmission. 
The important advantage of this technique is that at 
receiver’s side no additional information and no computation 
are required. Because not all subcarriers are used to transmit 
useful information, this method has the disadvantage of a 
lower data rate.

In order to reduce the computation complexity and to 
improve 
the 
performance, 
several 
PAPR 
reduction 
techniques were derived from the original tone reservation 
method: selective mapping of partial tones (SMOPT) [6], 
One-Tone One-Peak (OTOP) [7] and one-by-one iteration 
[8], fast TR described in [5]. 
The class of non-linear methods is represented by 
approaches like clipping, partial clipping (PC), signal 
compression and active constellation extension (ACE). 
The clipping method is another very well known non-
linear PAPR reduction technique, where the amplitude of the 
signal is limited to a given threshold. 
Taking in consideration the fact that the signal must be 
interpolated before A/D conversion, a variety of clipping 
methods has been proposed. Some methods suggest the 
clipping before interpolation, having the disadvantage of the 
peaks regrowth. Other methods suggest the clipping after 
interpolation, having the disadvantage of out-of-band power 
production. In order to overcome this problem, different 
filtering techniques have been proposed. Filtering can also 
cause peak regrowth, but less than the clipping before 
interpolation [9].  
Signal compression is another group of non-linear 
methods which improves the PAPR reduction. For this 
purpose some papers proposed µ-law/A-law companding 
functions [13], exponential companding function [12], 
piecewise-scales [11] or polynomial ratio functions [14] after 
the clipping. One of the drawbacks of these methods is the 
increased noise level generated by the corresponding signal 
decompression. 
The partial clipping is another nonlinear PAPR reduction 
method which performs additional signal processing in 
frequency-domain to reduce the distortions of the signal’s 
spectrum. This method supposes that only subcarriers having 
the highest phase difference between the original signal and 
its clipped variant will be changed [10]. 
The ACE method relays on the idea that the outer points 
from the original constellation may be moved toward outside 
in order to reduce the PAPR level of the transmitted signal. 
The domain for allowed alternative points is chosen so that 
the signal processing does not reduce the constellation’s 
minimum-distance but lowers the PAPR level [15-17].  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second 
section describes the OFDM signal, some of its properties, 
and some aspects of the high power amplifier. The third 
section describes the proposed hybrid PAPR reduction 
scheme. Next, the numerical results highlighted by the 
computer simulation are presented and discussed. Based on 
the results obtained, some conclusions are presented. 
II. 
THE OFDM SIGNAL 
An OFDM-based communication system uses a complex 
multicarrier modulation. Each of the N subcarriers, having 
the frequencies {fn, n=0,1,…,N-1}, are modulated with a data 
sample from a block of symbols {Xn, n=0,1,…,N-1}.  
In order to reduce the bandwidth of the required 
frequency spectrum, the subcarriers are chosen to be 
orthogonal, that is fn=nΔf, where Δf=1/T, and T is the OFDM 
symbol period.  
Considering these aspects, the resulting signal can be 
written as:

In 
the 
many 
cases, 
the 
OFDM-based 
system 
communicates through multipath channels, which generate 
intersymbol interference (ISI). In order to avoid this 
problem, a fraction from the current signal period, 
corresponding to a guard interval, is added to the signal. 
After Digital-to-Analogue (D/A) conversion, the signal is 
modulated and applied to a HPA. The amplified signal is 
applied to the antenna.  
At the receiver, after demodulation, the guard interval 
will be removed, the symbols being evaluated for time 
intervals of length T. 
Due to statistical independence of subcarriers, the low-
pass time-domain OFDM signal in the complex domain 
presents a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, sporadically, the 
signal presents peaks, causing the PAPR problem. The 
expression of the PAPR for a given OFDM signal block is 
given by:

The non-linearity of the transmitted signal, produced by

The optimal solution for PAPR problem may not be the 
best solution for the SDR problem and vice versa. Because 
these two problems are correlated, in practice, a suboptimal 
solution may be chosen [15]. 
III. 
THE HYBRID METHOD 
In this section, we present the proposed hybrid PAPR 
reduction technique which has been obtained by the 
association of PTS method with clipping method. 
The main idea for combining the two methods is relying 
on the observation that the cumulative signal processing for 
PAPR reduction significantly improves the overall outcome. 
Furthermore, the hybrid technique exploits the fact that each 
of the component methods is based on a different principle.  
One performs linear transformation by rotating the 
vectors from the frequency-domain signal, and the other one 
performs a non-linear transformation represented by signal 
limitation. The block diagram of the proposed method is 
presented in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  The Hybrid PTS-CLP scheme for PAPR reduction. 
The performance of the proposed PAPR reduction 
technique is analyzed with a MATLAB simulator as 
presented in Figure 3. Within this simulator, the samples 
from the generated signal are mapped from binary 
representation to the M-QAM or M-PSK constellation 
points. The obtained complex values are grouped in blocks 
of N elements each, forming the OFDM symbols. The 
obtained OFDM frames are applied sequentially to PTS 
block and then to clipping block. For a better evaluation of 
the proposed method, the results obtained only from 
clipping [9] are also considered. 
The parameters of the resulting signal change according 
with the signal processing applied by the two PAPR 
reduction methods.

technique. 
In order to evaluate the performance and efficiency of o 
communication system based on the proposed PAPR 
reduction method, the simulator computes the bit error rate 
(BER) and power spectral density (PSD) for the original and 
processed signals.  
The PTS method operates on the frequency-domain 
signal iteratively until the best signal derivate is found. As 
already mentioned, the main idea of this method is to 
change the phases of the vectors composing the signal. This 
method considers the signal’s vectors as being grouped in 
disjoint blocks. The vectors from a block may have a 
contiguous displacement, or they may be interleaved with 
the vectors representing another block. The algorithm 
applies one phase shift for each bloc iteratively until the 
signal variant having the lowest PAPR is found. 
In the present work, the PTS method was implemented 
considering contiguous blocks of same length each. 
Additionally, for a better PAPR reduction, the proposed PTS 
method performs position swap between these blocks. This 
procedure is depicted in Figure 4.

Therefore, the PTS method considered in this paper consists 
in two stages as the Figure 5 shows. 
Based on this block diagram, the PTS algorithm consists 
in the following steps. 
1) Starting with a set of N data symbols Xin, representing an

2) Rearrange the values Xin using the swap table an,k, where 
n=1...N is the index of a given vector, and k=1…P is the 
index of a signal variant from a set of P possibilities. 
Therefore the output signal can be written as:

4) Compute the PAPR for all P variants, and choose the one 
with lowest PAPR level for the following processing step. 
5) Rotate all the constellation vectors from Xswp using the 
phase table φn,k, where n=1...N is the index of a vector, and 
h=1…R is the index of the signal variant from a set of R 
possibilities. The signal becomes:

7) Compute the PAPR for all R variants, and choose the one 
with lowest PAPR level for the transmission. 
 
 
The signal Xpts is derived from Xin which has modified 
values for both amplitude and phase of all vectors.  Because 
the receiver must reconstruct the original signal by applying 
inverse operations, it has to know the block swapping tables 
and rotation angle tables. For this purpose, it is necessary 
either to consider predefined tables or to transmit additional 
information to receiver. 
An important drawback of this method is that an increased 
size of these tables implies increased computation 
complexity. 
Furthermore, 
if 
the 
number 
of 
block 
permutations is too high, the possibility for signal 
reconstruction decreases very much. In such cases, searching 
of different block position exchanges is not enough, 
additional information being required. 
In order to overcome this problem, we propose a block 
marking scheme, as presented in Figure 6. The main idea of 
this model is to use one data carrier as label for each block. 
The PTS method changes the phases of all vectors within 
all blocks. If vector rotation is avoided for the marking 
subcarriers, PAPR level may not be efficiently reduced. 
Therefore, the marking model can not relay on the phase 
information from the additional subcarriers. Additionally 
amplitude information may not be enough for block 
indexing, when amplitude levels are less than the number of 
blocks within the OFDM frame. More, the amplitude is 
significantly affected by noise.  
In order to overcome these problems, the proposed block 
marking model, uses differential phase information. For this 
purpose two subcarriers are considered. One represents the 
phase reference, and the other one represents the block 
index. 
Since amplitudes of these marking vectors do not carry 
any information, for an improved demodulation, these 
amplitudes can be increased. 
In order to compensate any degradation of the PAPR 
reduction due to these marking tones, additional two 
subcarriers are considered. This technique is similar to the 
tone reservation PAPR reduction method described in [5]. 
Their phases should be opposite to the phases of the 
marking subcarriers. Since a tone compensation method is 
efficient when frequency difference is minimal, their 
positions are interleaved as in Figure 6.

Figure 7.  Clipping based PAPR reduction  model. 
 
The applied clipping technique [9] is presented in the 
block diagram from Figure 7. 
Here, the input vector [a0,…,aN-1] is first converted from 
frequency to time domain using an oversized IFFT. For the 
oversampling factor p, the input vector is padded with N(p-1) 
zeroes placed in the middle of the vector. This results in a 
trigonometric interpolation of the time domain signal, which 
fits well for the signals with integral frequencies over 
original FFT window, like is the case of OFDM. The 
interpolated signal is then clipped by limiting its amplitude.  
The clipping ratio is defined as ratio of the clipping level 
A and the root-mean-square power σ of the unclipped 
baseband signal,

The proposed hybrid PAPR reduction technique contains 
both linear and non-linear signal processing blocks. This 
fact produces a high flexibility from the signal processing 
point of view.  
When PTS block is configured to use a reduce set of signal 
variants, its smaller PAPR reduction can be compensated by 
the clipping block. This approach presents the advantage of a 
decreased amount of computation with the price of a higher 
signal distortion. When PTS block is configured to use an 
extended set of signal variants, the increased PAPR 
reduction requires a decreased signal distortion in the 
clipping block. The drawback in this case is represented by 
the increased amount of computation. 
IV. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The MATLAB simulations have been performed for base-
band signals with N=128 and N=256 subcarriers using M-
QAM and M-PSK modulations, with corresponding 
constellations having M=16 points. For the clipping block 
was considered a clipping rate CR set to 12 and the 
oversampling factor p set to 2.  
For the reference clipping-only method, the simulation 
considers the clipping rate CR having some values in range 
of 6-16 and the oversampling factor p set to 2 as well. 
For the OFDM signal spectrum computation, it was 
considered that the distance between two adjacent 
subcarriers is 0.2 MHz. 
The results presented in this paper are obtained using a 
phase rotation array containing 4 sets of phases with 
values
π / 2
ϕ
k = k ⋅
, where k=0…3, and 4 sets of phases 
with values
2π / 5
ϕ
k = k ⋅
, where k=0…4. For the block 
swapping, the proposed method used a set of 8 randomly 
chosen combinations for the case when the OFDM signal is 
composed by 8 blocks of same length. The combinations are 
chosen in order to present a variety of blocks interleaving. 
Some of them exchange odd blocks with even blocks, other 
exchange blocks from first half with blocks from the second 
half. Also, there are cases when only neighborhood blocks 
are changed. 
The numerical results show that the proposed scheme 
improves the PAPR reduction in comparison with the use of 
only one of the component methods.  For the evaluation of 
the performance of the proposed technique, two cases are 
presented. 
The first case considers an OFDM signal with N=128 
subcarriers with a 16-QAM modulation. The Figure 8 and 
Figure 9 indicate the corresponding PAPR reduction and 
signal’s frequency spectrum respectively. 
In Figure 8, it can be observed that the modified PTS 
method with markers and the pure clipping method with 
CR=12 have similar PAPR reduction. The PAPR reduction 
is significantly better when the PTS method does not add 
block markers in the signal. The hybrid PTS-clipping 
method provides better PAPR reduction since it accumulates 
the effects from the two methods. 
In Figure 9, it can be remarked that in the case of the 
modified PTS method the signal’s spectrum is wider and 
has a different shape. This is caused by the insertion of 
additional subcarriers for the block marking and reserved 
tones. In this case each of the eight blocks contains two free 
reserved tones. 
The second case considers an OFDM signal with N=256 
subcarriers with a 16-PSK modulation. The clipping rate is 
set to same value. The resulted PAPR reduction and signal’s 
frequency spectrum are presented in Figure 11 and Figure 
12 respectively. 
In Figure 11, it can be observed that the difference 
between the PAPR reduction of the PTS methods and 
clipping-only method is even smaller. However, the hybrid 
method provides better PAPR reduction for this case too. 
In Figure 12, it can be remarked that in case of the 
alternative PTS method, the signal’s spectrum is slightly 
wider, but less than the one from the previous case. This is 
due to the missing of the free reserved tones.

Figure 10 and Figure 13 show that the BER performance 
is slightly influenced by the proposed PAPR reduction 
technique, being better than in case of simple clipping.  
The PTS method applied in the hybrid scheme does not 
use the presented block marking technique. The PTS 
method which includes the block marking technique is 
separately evaluated.  
The Power Spectral Density (PSD) characteristics 
presented in Figure 9 and Figure 12 highlighted two aspects 
of the block marking. The first case considers a block 
marking with two guard subcarriers per block. The second 
case considers no zero subcarriers within the blocks. The 
amplitude of the marker subcarriers was set to be equal with 
the mean value of all data subcarriers. 
The required bandwidth for the OFDM signal resulted 
after the PTS derivate method has increased due of the 
additional subcarriers. The shape of the frequency spectrum 
has a slight variation according with the added guard 
subcarriers.  
For the reference clipping method, some PAPR reduction 
curves 
together 
with 
their 
corresponding 
BER 
characteristics are presented in the Figure 14 and Figure 15, 
respectively. 
The simulations have shown that a smaller value for the 
clipping ratios increases the PAPR reduction. The case of 
clipping only with CR=6 presents similar results for the 
PAPR reduction as those obtained with the hybrid method 
with the previously presented configurations. 
The major disadvantage of the clipping only method is that 
its increased signal distortion leads to a considerable lower 
BER performance. 
Therefore, the presented numerical results shown that, in 
all cases, the hybrid PTS-clipping method provides better 
PAPR reduction than in case of use of only one method. 
Additionally, compared with clipping only method, the 
combined technique presents insignificantly degradation of 
the BER performance.

The computational complexity of the algorithm of the 
hybrid technique is given by the sum of the computational 
complexity of the component methods. 
The PTS block performs one IFFT, a rearranging of the N 
subcarriers and change of the phase of all N subcarriers per 
iteration. Considering the fact that that the PTS method has 
to perform P block rearranging and R phase changes, the 
amount of operations corresponding to this component 
method is

For the clipping block, the computation complexity is 
given by the cumulated amount of complexity for effective 
clipping and frequency-domain filtering.  
The effective clipping block requires one IFFT on the 
frequency-domain signal with zero padding and N·p 
amplitude limitations operation on the time-domain signal.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper we proposed an alternative PAPR reduction 
technique based on the combination of a partial transmit 
sequence method with the clipping method. The PTS and 
clipping algorithms used within the hybrid technique are 
explained.  
The numerical results show that the hybrid scheme brings 
higher PAPR reduction than the component methods.  
The considered two methods have few variants with 
different efficiency and performance.

The PTS method may be implemented using different 
block structures, swapping tables and rotation angle tables. 
Additionally, the block marking can be implemented in 
various manners, determining different efficiency for PAPR 
reduction and different sizes of the search space at the 
receiver’s side. 
The clipping method, may consider various filtering 
techniques, each of them leading to various PAPR reduction 
efficiency. 
Therefore the efficiency of the hybrid method may vary 
when derivates of the component methods are used. 
In future work, we will consider different block 
configurations and different set of values for the tables 
within the PTS block. Some clipping derivates also may be 
considered.
