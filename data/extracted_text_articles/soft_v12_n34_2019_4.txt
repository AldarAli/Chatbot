Abstract—This systematic literature review intends to determine
the extent to which contribution is available to assist organisations
and interested parties to understand better or comply with
the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 international standard,
known as Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).
The primary aim of this paper is to explore the current literature
in the ISMS as speciﬁed by the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, aiming
to provide a mapping of their contributions with the requirements
of the standard. An objective of this study is to explore the
ways in which the literature addresses the requirements of the
ISMS. This study uses semi-quantitative analysis in order to gain
insights into the concepts and techniques around the ISMS and
to systematically obtain data to help with identifying the research
gaps. One of the ﬁndings of this review is to encourage to beneﬁt
from available literature and to develop an ISMS to promote their
corporate compliance with a well-established standard. The most
striking result from the review is that the majority of approaches
proposed by scholars between 2005 to 2018 are with limited
support in adopting the information security management system.
Another important ﬁnding is that almost all available approaches
fundamentally lack the motivation to focus on the analysis and
application of the ISMS with no single study enable organisations
to adopt the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.
Keywords–ISO/IEC 27001; information security management
systems; PDCA; requirements engineering; information security

INTRODUCTION
In the new global economy, organisations face tougher
pressure in securing their internal and external information.
Some of these pressures are through national and international
laws and regulations, interested parties expectations, and or-
ganisational requirements to safeguard their business secrets
from their competitors. It is a compelling task for organisations
to meet the security requirements and take the necessary
actions to implement and satisfy their security objectives [1].
In contrast, the continual change in technology, management
use of technology and the impact on business success makes
the management information systems an exciting topic in
organisations [2].
To date, there has been no solid evidence to absolute
security and protection, however, there are available security
frameworks and techniques to promote the best practices in
managing information security. Organisations need to prepare
towards sophisticated approaches considering security and its
associates under one interconnected application to successfully
manage conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of informa-
tion assets. The numbers of security breaches are getting
bigger and invaders are getting smarter in ways to exploit
security vulnerabilities. Conventional and outdated managing
of information security does not answer the needs of the
current structure [3] [4]. Experts believe that more than 90%
of successful cyber attacks could have been prevented by the
technology available at the time [5].
Information Security Management System (ISMS) as de-
ﬁned by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
27001 is an international standard to provide requirements
for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually
improving an information security practices in organisations.
ISO/IEC 27001 is integrated part of the organizations processes
and overall management structure and that information security
is considered in the design of processes, information systems,
and controls. The standard is applicable to all organisations,
regardless of their type, size, or nature [6] and it constitutes a
certiﬁable standard and is widely used with steady growth in
a number of adoptions [7]. The standard provides mapping
for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually
improving an information security management system or
alternatively known as Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) model.
It is a strategic decision for an organisation to adopt ISMS
and to preserve the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of
information by applying risk management process and giving
conﬁdence to interested parties that risks are adequately man-
aged. ISMS is composed of processes, policies, and resources
that can be used to systematise the security demands of an
organisation. Organisations understand that it is in their interest
to follow some type of internationally recognised reference
framework to create environments for information security
management systems rather than doing it ad hoc [8].
The primary aim of this systematic review is to investigate
in detail the available software engineering techniques on the
ISMS that enable organisations to comply with the require-

METHOD
This study conducted in the form of a systematic literature
review by employing Guidelines for Performing Systematic
Literature Reviews in Software Engineering introduced by
Kitchenham et al. [9] [10] and Webster et al. [11].
The review involved a series of activities divided into three
phases are shown in Figure 1. The steps in the review method
documented below.
Planning phase: The initial step sketched the need for
undertaking this review by considering all existing information
about the ISO/IEC 27001 standard and software engineering
in a thorough and impartial manner. The second step of the
planning was to specify the research questions by considering
the types and structure of the questions as discussed in Section
II-A. The last part of the planning phase was to develop a
review protocol to speciﬁes the methods that will be used to
undertake the review and reducing the possibility of a bias.
The components of our review protocol include study selection
procedures explained in Section II-B, study selection criteria
deﬁned in Section II-C, data extraction strategy set out in
Section II-D, and synthesis of the extracted data explained in
Section II-E.
Conducting: This phase implemented the steps identiﬁed
in the research protocol from the former phase. The initial
step identiﬁed the primary studies to provide direct evidence
about the research questions. Next, to accurately recorded the
information obtain from the primary studies. Finally, a de-
scriptive synthesis of the primary studies developed to provide
a summary of the results in Section III.
Reporting: The last phase involved the writing of the review
ﬁndings obtained from the results section are summarised in
Section IV.
A. Motivation and Research questions
The research to date from the industry and academia tend
to focus on the overall description of the standard and such ex-
positions are unsatisfactory because little is being contributed
to the practicality of the ISMS structure. The generalisability
of much-published research on the standard is insufﬁcient for
organisations aiming to implement the standard.
IT Governance, a provider of IT compliance solutions to
organisations released an annual survey [12] centred around
the experience and implementation challenges of the ISO/IEC
27001 for organisations in 2016. The investigation of 250
information security professionals from 53 countries who
participated in the survey were mostly certiﬁed or working to-
wards certiﬁcation (80%). 71% of respondents received either
regular or occasional requests to provide the ISO/IEC 27001
certiﬁcation from clients or when proposing for new business.
By providing compliance to a globally known standard, certiﬁ-
cation signiﬁcantly reduces the need for repeated client audits.
The survey also found that a third of all respondents were
concerned about understanding the requirements of the stan-
dard and 28% considered the creation and managing the
standard documentation a challenging task. Other substantial
challenging tasks were conducting the information security risk
assessment and identifying the required controls for 22% and
14% of the respondents respectively.
From the commercial aspect, it is a rather difﬁcult and
costly task to identify the resources required to implement,
measure, and manage information security. From an academic
perspective, ISMS have mostly drawn from the views of
practitioners [13] and our literature review indicates that ISMS
has not been particularly attractive in academia with a lack of
research and approaches are egregious. Management systems
on information security received very limited observation
and research from the academic community despite the high
interest from organisations in particular for IT, operational and
compliance audits [14].
The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate and
measure the current literature in compare with the requirements
of the standard and gain further understanding of the gap in the
literature. The review sought to answer the following research
questions:
RQ1. What are the software engineering approaches that
organisations could use to apply or implement the require-
ments of the ISMS as deﬁned by the ISO/IEC 27001 standard?
We aim to identify the software engineering techniques and
tools to assist interested parties, such as information secu-
rity ofﬁcers, compliance managers, and top management in
organisations to adopt and comply with the requirements of
the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.
RQ2. What are the scholarly contributions to the literature
since the introduction of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard in 2005?
Research into a good security practice has a long history
back to 1989 when a set of internationally recognised security
evaluation criteria was developed by the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) Commercial Computer Security Centre

(CCSC). This was further developed by British Standard Insti-
tute to British Standard BS7799-1 in 1995 and later adopted
by ISO/IEC 17799 as Code of practice for Information Se-
curity Management in 2000; this document was reproduced to
ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS requirements in 2005. The 2005 version
of the standard was extensively revised in 2013, it became
generic with more ﬂexibility and some controls were added or
changed in the new and current version of the standard. Part
of the aim of this review is to trace the development of the
literature within the life of the standard from its introduction
in 2005.
RQ3. What are the limitations of the current research?
Another aim of this paper is to critically analyse the effects
of the current literature in comparison with the requirements
of the standard and whether the literature provides sufﬁcient
contribution to facilitate the use of the standard for organisa-
tions.
B. Search process
Each journal and conference proceedings were reviewed
and assessed by the ﬁrst author, however, the papers that ad-
dressed literature of any type identiﬁed as included or excluded
were discussed with the other researchers. The researcher
responsible for searching the journal or conference applied the
detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria to the relevant papers.
The automated search strategy was followed in our research
to identify the primary studies. The electronic libraries used
were:
•
Google Scholar
•
IEEE Xplore
•
Springer
•
Science Direct
•
Research Gate
•
British Library EThOS
•
ACM Digital Library
•
Abstracts in New Technologies and Engineering
•
Web of Science
As part of the literature studies, certain keywords and syn-
onyms were established and included in the research. We
worked on keywords and terms that these studies use to specify
essential concepts of relevance to ISMS. For the retrieval in the
digital libraries, a sophisticated search string was constructed
using Boolean ANDs and ORs. The string given below was
derived and taken as a basis to apply to the title, keywords,
and abstracts of publications:
((’iso/iec 27001 standard’ OR ’information security man-
agement systems’ OR ’isms’ OR ’information security stan-
dard’ OR ’security standard’) AND (’requirements engineer-
ing’ OR ’compliance engineering’ OR ’security requirements
engineering’ OR ’software engineering’))
The above search strings were assessed using the applicable
elements from Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies
(PRESS) checklist by McGown et al. [15]. The validation
results obtained from the PRESS assessment are set out in
Table I. Some electronic libraries did not provide advanced
search options that allow for the use of the search string as is.
For these sites, we either extended the context of the search or
separated the search into several sub-searches preserving the
initial search context. The selection of primary studies was
governed by the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

C. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Peer-reviewed articles on the the following topics were
included:
•
An article published between 01 Jan 2005 and 30 June
2018: we wanted to cover the years that both versions
of the standard published in 2005 and 2013, hence, it
is fair to cover from the start of 2005 until the current
date.
•
An article should discuss the search string described
in Section II-B.
•
An article should propose a software engineering
technique in addressing the standard: the aim of this
paper is to capture the contributions from the ﬁeld of
software engineering.
Articles on the following topics were excluded:
•
An article that is not written in English.
•
White papers or informal articles: not peer-reviewed
papers or articles, which provide a plain description of
the standard rather than purposing a technicality were
excluded.
•
Duplicate reports of the same study: when several
reports of a study exist in different journals the most
complete version of the study was included in the
review.
D. Data collection
This review does not claim to have captured every approach
within the ISMS, however, the aim of this review is to have
a holistic comprehension of the current state of the art in the
ISMS. We recognise there could be a number of other related
approaches that consider other ISMS methodologies such as
ISACA COBIT or NIST Cybersecurity Framework, however,
the intention of this paper is ISO/IEC 27001 standard and to
achieve a fairly detailed conclusion within this topic.
The information extracted from the selected studies must
reﬂect our research questions and indicate a desirable contri-
bution towards the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. The initial studies
of 285 papers were converged by learning their meta-data
including title, abstract, keywords, and conclusion. A total of
95 papers met our objectives and aims of this review, which
led us to further investigate the full text of a study. Finally, 21

papers were selected as primary studies for in-depth evaluation
and participation in our review paper.
The order of reporting the primary studies in the next
section is in chronological order and for the purpose of fairness
and accuracy, the same amount of information about each
selected study was extracted. The data extracted from each
study were:
Approach title: This is a proposed title by the authors of
a primary study for his/her approach or contribution. If a title
was not available then we referred to the ﬁrst author’s full
name.
Year of publication: The year when the paper was pub-
lished. If a paper was published in several different sources
both dates were recorded and the ﬁrst date was used in any
analysis.
Type: Each primary study was categorised into two termi-
nologies including Framework or Method, the deﬁnition used
for each is as follow:
•
Framework: This is a process or conceptual layered
structure intended to serve as a support or guideline
for the building of something useful [16].
•
Method: It refers to the methods the researchers use
in performing an operation [17].
Scope: The scope equally measures the contribution of a study
towards the PDCA model. The four stages include:
•
Plan: Establish the ISMS policy, objectives, processes
and procedures relevant to managing risk and improv-
ing information security.
•
Do: Implement and operate the ISMS policy, controls,
process and procedures.
•
Check: Assess and measure process performance
against ISMS policy.
•
Act: Maintain and improve the ISMS by taking cor-
rective actions where nonconformity occurs.
Findings and practical implications: This term refers to anal-
ysis, discussion, results, and identiﬁcation of outcomes and
implications for practice in the primary studies. In case of
duplicate publications, the most completed paper among those
was used by referring to the versions of the report to obtain
all the necessary data.
E. Data analysis
A set of 22 criteria as described in Table II were excerpted
from the clauses and sub-clauses of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013
standard to compare and evaluate the identiﬁed studies.
The standard speciﬁes the requirements for establish-
ing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an
ISMS within the context of the organisation. Excluding any of
the requirements is not acceptable when an organisation claims
conformity to this standard, hence, a similar approach is used
to measure the level of fulﬁlment to all requirements of the
standard by each identiﬁed study.
The same deﬁnition for each criterion as speciﬁed in the
standard [18] is followed, to allow the established uniform
description used in our review and to avoid misinterpreta-
tion or misjudgement. These criteria were selected from the
current version of the standard published in 2013, however,
it is recognised that majority of the literature was published
prior to 2013, therefore, a formal mapping [19] of ISO/IEC
27001:2013 clauses to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 version were
used to ensure that papers published prior to 2013 are not
disadvantaged in comparison with papers published post 2013.
The order in presenting the criteria do not reﬂect their
importance or imply their implementing order; the list items
are enumerated for reference purpose only.
III.
RESULTS
The following summarises the result of our review from
the selected studies under the keywords that this research
interested to investigate.
Chang and Ho proposed a model [20] [21] to explore the
inﬂuence of organisational factors on the effectiveness of im-
plementing the BS7799 (replaced by ISO/IEC 27001) standard.
The ﬁndings deﬁned four factors that could cause a serious
impact on the success of the implementation of the information
security management, they included IT competence of busi-
ness managers, environmental uncertainty, industry type, and
organisational size. The impact of these factors could be varied
between any types of organisations. The ﬁndings indicate large
organisations may beneﬁt more in implementing information
system security standards since they are more depended on
formalisation and standardisation than small companies and
have a greater amount of assets. Their studies were limited as
only targeted 59 organisations in Taiwan but it was expected
to have a similar result for another region too.
Mellado et al. proposed Security Requirements Engineer-
ing Process (SREP) [22] [23] to incorporate security require-
ments such as Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15480) into the
software life cycle model in a structured process. SREP used
a collection of standards, processes and activities for the
development of secure information systems under a systematic
approach. The framework was made up of nine activities
known as micro-process to form the security requirements
engineering, as well as the external and visible artefacts that
involve the activities. The activities included the determination
of the security vision, understanding of the stakeholders, the
identiﬁcation of the vulnerabilities and assets, identiﬁcation of
security objectives and threats, risk assessment, the elicitation-
prioritisation- inspection of security requirements and the
repository improvement.
Anwar et al. proposed Preventive Information Security
Management (PrISM) [24] system, a model to advance the
security assurance and risk handling process in an ISMS with
intrusion prevention capabilities. PrISM developed a network
security solution including a number of services and function-
alities, such as intrusion, detection and prevention capability,
integrity checks, incident management and managerial report-
ing. The above could be incorporated in a single control panel
to enable the integration, summarising and linking all the tools
and functionalities together. This could assist with automating
incident handling and other tasks, which could minimise the
operational risks within organisations using comprehensive
security monitoring.
Fenz et al. proposed OntoWorks [25] [26], which is an
ontological mapping of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard support-
ing the certiﬁcation process. Authors proposed a framework
to use ontological data and enable users to access, visualise,

and reason on ontological data. Their contribution helped for
audit preparation and rule-based compliance checks regarding
ISO/IEC 27001 controls. As some of the operations delivered
as partial automation, this will increase the automation process
within the certiﬁcation process, resulting in saving costs and
resources. Fenz et al. [27] later proposed security ontology to
be used to increase the efﬁciency of the compliance checking
process by introducing a formal representation of the ISO/IEC
27002 standard.
Mellado et al. proposed Security Requirements Engineer-
ing Process for Software Product Lines (SREPPLine) [28],
[29], this was a solution for managing security requirements at
an early stage of the product line development driven by secu-
rity standards. This framework was structured management of
the security requirements to facilitate the conformance of the
software product line products to relevant security standards
such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 15408. The proposal con-
sisted of two sub-process including the product line security
domain engineering and the product line security application
requirements engineering. These sub-processes responsible for
four phases of requirements engineering, such as requirements
elicitation, requirements analysis and negotiation, requirements
documentation, and requirements validation and veriﬁcation.
Mellado et al. [30] later used Secure Tropos framework for
Software Product Lines requirements engineering for elicita-
tion of security requirements and their analysis on both a social
and technical dimensions.
Boehmer proposed a methodology [31] [32] to measure
the effectiveness of the implementation and operation of an
ISMS in organisations. The methodology delivered a solution
to form an assessment through audits checking of the internal
controls. Internal controls included administrative controls,
physical controls, and technical controls.
Mayer proposed Information System Security Risk Man-
agement (ISSRM) [33] [34] [35], providing a reference con-
ceptual model for security risk management. The author pro-
posed a model-based approach for ISSRM, applicable since
the early phases of IS development. The work focused on the
modelling support to such an approach, by proposing a domain
model for ISSRM. The work deﬁned a reference conceptual
model for security risk management and enhancement of
the domain model with the different metrics used in a risk
management method. Further, the authors developed a proposal
of the Secure Tropos language and a process to use the
extension in the frame of risk management.
Ekelhart et al. proposed AUtomated Risk and Utility Man-
agement (AURUM) [36] [37], a risk management methodology
to support the NIST 800-30 risk management standard. The
methodology focused on the risk management approach by
conducting various techniques such as questionnaires, on-
site interviews, document reviews, and automated scanning
tools to gather the required information under an ontological
framework. AURUM provides risks assessment management
by understanding the organisation characterisation followed by
vulnerability identiﬁcation, threat identiﬁcation, risk likelihood
determination, control analysis, control recommendations with
appropriate controls, cost/beneﬁt evaluation, impact analysis,
modelled and taken from best practise standards such as the IT
Grundschutz. This is a methodology for supporting information
security risk management through modelling the organisation’s
assets within an ontological framework.
Valdevit et al. proposed an approach [38] [39] on how
to adopt ISO 27001 on SMEs and their speciﬁc needs in
implementing the ISMS. They developed their approach to
knowledge gained in SMEs for several years in several dis-
ciplines and sectors. This was an approach where researchers

and practitioners work together, towards a number of activities
including problem diagnosis, active intervention, and reﬂective
learning. Authors described their approach as a “blend of
theoretical reviews and experiments”.
Hensel and Lemke-Rust proposed an approach [40] of
Braun [41] to business engineering was chosen for the integra-
tion of ISO/IEC 27001 into an enterprise architecture. Authors
integrated an ISMS into a systematic business engineering.
The approach consisted of four layers such as strategic layer
considered the internal and external requirements of an organi-
sation and its strategic alignment; organisation layer considered
the overall organisation process vision and deﬁnes the roles
and responsibilities of the ISMS; the information system layer
considered the information assets and information architecture
of the organisation including software component and plat-
form view; infrastructure and technology layer considered the
infrastructure used for conducting a risk analysis of an ISMS.
Schneider et al. proposed Heuristic Requirements Assistant
(HeRA) [42], an assistant tool to enable the identiﬁcation
and analysis of security requirements by applying experience-
based tool rather than dependency on experts. An approach
to provide knowledge about security best practises to devel-
opers and designers with limited experience. This approach
is based on modelling the ﬂow and enabling the stakeholders
to exchange, learning and reusing relevant experiences about
security requirements at the project requirements level.
Muller et al. introduced a tool [43] [44] to supports cloud
service providers and consumers under a security management
platform. A Security Management Platform (SMP) to specify
the security requirements and measure the effectiveness of
implemented controls for cloud service providers and con-
sumers to conjointly manage information security. The system
management platform consisted of three steps: service provider
and consumer identify the security requirements for a cloud
service in order to prepare a speciﬁc service level agreement
based on agreed requirements, service provider manage and
maintain the implementation and operation of security controls
in a traceable and transparent manner, service provider is
responsible to measure the speciﬁed requirements, identiﬁed in
the ﬁrst step and periodically to generate reports and incident
reports about implemented controls to stakeholders.
Gillies proposed 5S2IS [45], an approach to facilitate SMEs
to implement and comply with ISO/IEC 27000 standard. The
proposed approach developed a two-dimensional matrix with
the use of ISO/IEC standard and the Capability Maturity
Model (CMM). It included draw up a plan to understand the
organisation expectation and achieve the ISMS, deﬁne policies
and processes to reach the organisation goals, identify the non-
compliances with the goals through measurement, analyse and
identify the growth and improvement of performance through
monitoring, embed the ISMS in the organisation and plan to
attain for certiﬁcation if applicable.
Susanto et al. proposed Integrated Solution Framework
(I-SolFramework) [46] [47] [48] to assesses the readiness
level of an organisation towards the implementation of ISO
27001. The framework offered e-assessment and e-monitoring
to analyse and performed an assessment of the readiness
level of ISO 27001 implementation. E-assessment measure
ISO 27001 parameters based on the framework; it consisted
of six layers component including organisation, stakeholder,
tools and technology, policy, culture and knowledge with 21
controls. It helped to validate the ISO/IEC 27001 parameters
through an analytical interface such as histogram, charts and
graphs, provided by a framework.
Montesino et al. proposed Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) [49]. A framework to enable the organi-
sation to evaluate their compliance with IS standards and their
implementation effectiveness by automatically generating ISO
27001 based on IT security metrics [50]. Authors ﬁndings
indicated about 30% of the security controls of ISO/IEC 27001
standard can be automated. SIEM technology consisted of two
main functions of security information management system,
which handles the collection, reporting and analysis of log
data; and security event management, which monitors real-time
data and manages incident of security-related events. SIEM
based solution is proposed to centralise and incorporate a list
of ten automated controls including asset inventory, account
management, log management, system monitoring, malware
protection, vulnerability scanning and patch management,
security conﬁguration assessment and compliance checking,
information backup, physical security, incident management.
Azuwa et al. proposed Supervisory Control and Data Ac-
quisition (SCADA) [51] [52], An approach to measure the
effectiveness of network security management in SCADA.
This method speciﬁcally assisted to enable a measurement
approach to the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 27004 measurement
standard. It initially identiﬁes security controls followed by a
risk management approach to develop risk-based requirements
and prioritisation of security control implementation. This step
included the identiﬁcation of threats and vulnerabilities and
their impacts. The third stage was to develop an effective mea-
surement and metric through questionnaires and interviews,
perception and experts knowledge, certiﬁed organisations and
SCADA owners.
Beckers et al. proposed a methodology [53] [54] to analyse
security requirements engineering methods to support the
development and documentation of an ISMS according to
ISO/IEC 27001. Authors described the aims to improve the
result of ISO 27001 implementation through proper establish-
ment and documentation of an ISMS.
Chatzipoulidis et al. proposed a risk management approach
[55] called “to be” environment by focusing on analysing
threats, evaluating and treating vulnerabilities in the informa-
tion society. The author described information society as a
dynamic information security management system and pro-
posed a concept to enhance the role of e-government to support
public administration and cognitive resource for policymakers.
The “to be” environment methodology identiﬁed risks by
characterising the elements of risks and summarising critical
threats of cyberbullying and cyberstalking attack patterns;
identiﬁcation of risk by analysing cultural dynamics and as-
sessment of the current and planned controls of the system in
place; evaluation of risk by producing a list of critical risks,
prioritised based on set criteria; and risk treatment to lessen
risks to meet the risk appetite level.
Asosheh et al. proposed a framework [56] for implementing
an ISMS within a large-scale enterprise to assist them in
identifying related activities in establishing and implement-
ing an ISMS including the risk assessment and treatment
procedures. The process consisted of ﬁve steps according to
233

ISO/IEC 27003 implementation guidance such as obtaining
management approval for initiating the ISMS project. The
steps included a preliminary scope identiﬁcation and prepar-
ing deﬁnitions for ISMS and a business plan to have the
management approval. Deﬁning ISMS scope, boundaries and
ISMS policy, which helps to produce a ﬁnal document to set
the boundaries for the ISMS policy and scopes, conducting
information security requirements analysis that aims to identify
assets and needs of asset owners, and risk management.
Beckers et al. proposed PAttern-based method for estab-
lishing a Cloud speciﬁc informaTion Security management
system (PACTS) [57] [58] [59] [60]. An approach for cre-
ating an ISMS methodology compliance to the ISO 27001
standard cloud environment with a speciﬁc interest in legal
compliance and privacy. The overview of the methodology was
leadership commitment, asset identiﬁcation, threats analysis,
risk assessment, security policies and reasoning, ISMS speci-
ﬁcation, identify relevant laws and regulations, the deﬁnition
of compliance controls, instantiating privacy patterns, privacy
threats analysis.
Beckers et al. proposed ISMS-CORAS [61] [62], an exten-
sion of the COROS method to support the establishment of an
ISO/IEC 27001 compliant ISMS. Authors proposed a method-
ology following CORAS method. CORAS is a risk manage-
ment methodology based on the ISO 31000 standard, therefore,
providing compliance to ISO 31000 standard, consideration of
legal concerns tool support for document generation. CORAS-
ISMS support security management compliant with ISO/IEC
27001 standard.
IV.
DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the answers to our research
questions described in Section II-A.
RQ1. What are the software engineering approaches that
organisations could use to apply or implement the require-
ments of the ISMS as deﬁned by the ISO/IEC 27001 standard?
An overall description of the primary studies are shown in
Table III where appending each study Title, Year of publica-
tion, Type of contribution indicating Framework (F) or Method
(M), Scope(s) of the PDCA model covered by each study, and
depth of fulﬁlment at each Stage of the Plan, Do, Check, and
Act. A summary of each study was described in the previous
section.
Our speculation with respect to the PDCA model is that
very little attention is given at the Check stage where only
ﬁve studies out of 21 provided contribution to the relevant
part of the standard. Check speciﬁcally deals with assessment
and measurement process performance against the ISMS.
Act stage tends to have less to almost no contribution where
only one study out of 21 identiﬁed to address the relevant part
of the standard. Act maintains and improves an ISMS by taking
corrective actions where nonconformities occur. Interestingly,
even some of the proﬁcient concepts like ISMS-CORAS or
ISSRM did not target any of the named stages of the standard
in their studies.
RQ2. What are the scholarly contributions to the literature
since the introduction of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard in 2005?
The chart in Figure 2 depicts the overall fulﬁlment percent-
age of each study towards the requirements of the standard in
chronological order from 2005 to 2018.

The trend indicates the current studies are fragmented and
it is a challenging task for organisations to beneﬁt from the
current literature. Alternatively, they require to apply a number
of studies in conjunction with each other that may result to
an inconsistent, unmanageable, and intractable output. Whilst
the existing work could help with rather smaller sections of
the standard and used as a point of reference but they are
inadequate to realise the full requirements of the standard.
Our ﬁndings suggest that the majority of studies proposed
between 2005 to 2018 are incomplete and they mostly provide
a partial fulﬁlment to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001
standard. This review provides evidence with respect to a gap
in the ﬁeld of the ISMS.
The graph in Figure 3 reveals that a reasonable quantity
of the studies were produced between 2006-2008, after the
publication of the ﬁrst version of the standard in 2005; the
attention dropped until around 2010.
Half of the studies carried out between 2011 to 2013 and
it appears the consideration to the ISMS was higher prior
to the publication of the second version of the standard in
2013 than after. This shows an inconsistent and contradicts
association between the ﬁrst version and the second version
of the standard. A possible explanation could be the fact that
other standard documents in the family of ISO/IEC 27000 were
revised and published between 2011-2013, such as a revised
publication of ISO/IEC 27003 in 2010, ISO/IEC 2005 in 2011,
ISO/IEC 27006 in 2011, ISO/IEC 27007 in 2011, ISO/IEC
27008 in 2011.
The most striking result to emerge from the data is that
the expansion of further research dropped sharply after 2013
and no study was detected after the revised publication of the
standard in 2013, which should have caused some spark in

academia. It is interesting to note that almost all papers (20)
were published between 2007 to 2013.
RQ3. What are the limitations of the current research?
Table IV demonstrates a detailed review of all 21 studies
and their contribution at each criterion identiﬁed in the previ-
ous section; It provides the overall strength and limitation of
the study. The indicative asterisk (*) in the table denotes the
fulﬁlment of a criterion.
On average, some criteria are shown to have attracted
the majority of the literature than others. The areas where
signiﬁcant differences have been found include Organisational
context (1), Interested parties (2), Determining the scope (3),
Documented information (14), Operational planning (15), and
Information security risk assessment (16).
On the other hand, little to no evidence of some criteria was
detected such as Leadership (5), Policy (6), Resources (10),
Competence (11), Awareness (12), Communication (13), Mon-
itoring and measurement (18), Internal audit (19), Management
review (20), Nonconformity and corrective action (21), and
Continual improvement (22).
The results in the previous section indicated that far too lit-
tle attention has been paid to address all or most requirements
of the standard. Whilst some research were produced in years
in question, but only two studies attempted to investigate the
ISMS at a proﬁcient level, which meeting between 10 to 14
criteria out of 22. No study was found to reach the advanced
level, meaning to support more than 15 criteria out of 22. The
evidence afﬁrms that the majority (57%) of the selected studies
are at the developing stage, which means they are only able
to fulﬁl up to four (18%) requirement of the standard.
The average fulﬁlment rate of all the 21 studies is 23%
which is equivalent to ﬁve out of 22 requirements. Excluding
any of the 22 requirements speciﬁed in Table II is not accept-
able when an organisation claims conformity to the standard.
Taken together, the current studies are incomplete and the
current literature requires further expansion. The number of
studies at each category stands as below:
Basic = 7
Developing = 12
Proﬁcient = 2
Advanced = 0
This interpretation contrasts with ﬁndings in Table III
which provide detailed results about the scope of each study
at the PDCA model.
A considerable number of studies mostly fulﬁl the re-
quirements of the Plan (26%) and Do (52%) stages, whilst,
very few studies attempted to address Check (19%) and Act
(3%) stages. Additionally, it reveals that nearly two-thirds of
papers were considered as a Method whereas only seven papers
were identiﬁed as a Framework. It is also worth noting that a
distinct number of other papers which were dismissed during
the selection process and not considered for the purpose of
this systemic literature review were identiﬁed as Method.
A note of caution is due here since not every study selected
as part of our review claimed to speciﬁcally meet each and
every requirement of the standard and it could be argued that
those study only focused on the indicated criteria, however,
this suggests that there is a rudimentary gap in the knowledge.
V.
CONCLUSION
ISO/IEC 27001 standard provides mapping for establish-
ing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving
an information security management system. It is a strategic
decision for organisations to adopt ISMS and systematise the
security demands rather than doing it ad hoc.
The aim of this paper is to systematically investigate the
approaches, which assist organisations to develop, implement,
and comply with the ISMS as deﬁned by the standard pub-
lished between 2005 to 2018. The review examined the ap-
proaches, which are thought to contribute to the requirements
of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.
The results of this study indicate that there is no concept
that facilitates organisations in designing and complying with
the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, this means covering all the
22 requirements of the standard. The result indicates that a
very limited number of studies attempted to investigate the
ISMS at the proﬁcient level which meets at least half of the
requirements of the standard. No study was found to address
all parts of the ISMS. The average fulﬁlment rate of all 21
studies is 23% which is equivalent to addressing up to 5 out
of 22 requirements.
The majority of the primary studies were produced prior
to the 2013 and the current literature requires attention in
expanding, promoting, and the introduction of techniques to
organisations and enable them to achieve and strategically inte-
grate their organisational goals with their information security
objectives.
The most obvious ﬁnding to emerge from this study is that
substantial potential exists for academic researchers to investi-
gate the ISMS under a holistic approach. The current literature

lacks motivation in purposing new initiatives in the ﬁeld of the
ISMS and ISO/IEC 27001 standard.
In the absence of the knowledge in the literature, there is
abundant room for further progress in determining a technique
which, could handle the ISMS under a uniﬁed approach.
The evidence from this review suggests that there is a gap
in the current approaches to satisfy the requirements of the
ISO standard and fresh and comprehensive approaches are
beneﬁciary and recommended in advancing the ISMS.
Future research should be carried out to examine more
closely the links between all four scopes of the PDCA model.
More research is needed to develop a deeper understanding
of the relationships between ISO/IEC 27001 standard and
requirements engineering and greater efforts are required to
ensure that future approaches to account for all requirements
of the standard.
