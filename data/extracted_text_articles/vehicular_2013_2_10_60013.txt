Abstract—Road 
congestion 
has troubled 
hundreds 
of 
thousands of drivers for a long time. In recent years, an 
application named Dynamic Routing, in which vehicles reroute 
themselves around congested areas with road information 
received, is proposed to deal with traffic jam. However, due to 
the high mobility of the topology of vehicular networks, 
conventional Ad-Hoc routing is not suitable in Dynamic Routing. 
As a result, the opportunistic routing might play an important 
role in this field due to its disruption-tolerant nature. In this 
paper, we propose a geo-based opportunistic information 
dissemination model tailored for Dynamic Routing. Instead of 
the assumption that vehicles participate in message exchanging 
unconditionally or stand alone completely, we think that a 
considerable proportion of vehicles in real life belong to certain 
groups and take the willingness to make contributions to their 
own groups’ driving conditions as a rational cooperation 
incentive. We evaluate the performance of our model and its 
effect on saving trip-time in a realistic scenario on an integrated 
simulation platform. The experimental results show that our 
dissemination 
model 
decreases 
forwarding 
overhead 
dramatically while still delivering as many useful messages into 
right vehicles as conventional broadcast algorithm does. We also 
evaluate the performance of different groups in terms of 
forwarding efficiency and trip-time improvement.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Traffic congestion has long been a hot topic in the study of 
Intelligent Transport System (ITS). One solution to this 
problem is Dynamic Routing, in which vehicles equipped with 
Short-Range Devices (SRD) may re-compute their path with 
local digital maps and congestion warning (CW) messages 
received to route around congested streets. 
The 
dissemination 
of 
CW 
messages 
based 
on 
infrastructure seems to be a feasible solution, but the 
prohibitive expense makes it hard to be deployed globally. On 
the other hand, researches on opportunistic routing mechanism 
provide an alternative to exploit inter-vehicle communication 
to disseminate messages in an opportunistic manner. 
Geo-based opportunistic routing is one of the main 
branches of opportunistic routing researches. In geo-based 
opportunistic routing, the holder of a message tries to find a 
neighbor node that is "closer" to the target under a certain 
distance definition. Since many vehicles are already equipped 
with GPS devices, position information is now readily 
available. This leads to a great potential for geo-based 
opportunistic routing. 
Many researches have been done, aiming to establish a 
general information dissemination framework. However, each 
algorithm needs to be tailored for user applications before it is 
put into use, especially the metric they apply in next relay 
selection process. More specifically, in Dynamic Routing, the 
originator of a CW message knows neither IDs nor locations 
of potential receivers. Consequently, the distance to the target 
cannot be calculated. Dynamic Routing needs a geo-cast 
featured 
information 
dissemination 
model, 
and 
some 
researches reveal that candidates’ vehicle information will be 
of great help in relay selection [6][7]. 
Rational selfishness has also been regarded as a vehicle’s 
nature. Vehicles may not bother to originate and forward CW 
messages to enhance other vehicles’ driving condition. 
However, vehicles of the same group, such as taxis of a single 
company, would like to help divert their partners away from 
congested roads. How this partial cooperation would affect 
message dissemination and vehicles’ trip-time improvement 
also needs to be investigated further. 
In this paper, we propose a new geo-based information 
dissemination model, named Direction-Assisted Geographic 
Relay (DAGR) for Dynamic Routing. The model takes relay 
candidate’s moving direction and route into consideration 
while still leaving carry-CW-or-not decision for relay 
candidates to make. We evaluate the performance of our 
model on an integrated simulation platform proposed by A. 
Wegener et al. [12]. The results help us understand the impact 
of grouping of vehicles on dissemination and how trip-time 
improvements are distributed in a real city scenario. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We 
start by describing the existing related works in Section II, and 
then illustrate DAGR’s mechanism in Section III. In Section 
IV, we present our simulation setup and discuss some 
experimental results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Vehicular network is conventionally modeled as a planar 
graph where nodes are junctions and links are road segments. 
A vehicle may have a chance to forward a message as it 
approaches a junction [1][2]. 
In 
Geographic 
Delay-Tolerant 
Network 
(GeoDTN) 
Routing, Cheng et al. [3] summarized and categorized 
geo-based routing algorithms in vehicular networks. The 
routing process is divided into greedy mode, perimeter mode 
and DTN mode. Vehicles are classified into 4 categories by 
the deterministic of their destinations and routes. Different

distance metrics are defined for each category to guide the 
switch between routing modes and next relay selection. 
Lee et al. studied vehicles’ behavior at junctions in a micro 
perspective in [4]. Instead of choosing a farthest 1-hop 
neighbor as next relay, they proposed an augmented beacon to 
collect topology information within 2-hop area, and argued 
that this may help select a relay closer to the target in the 
situation that routes might be blocked by street topology. Ma 
et al. [5] used angle of vehicles’ motion vectors as a metric in 
relay selection and suggested that the bus system can be a 
communication backbone in geo-based opportunistic delivery 
service because of its high punctuality and deterministic of its 
route and destination. 
All these geo-based algorithms require that applications 
know targets’ positions or IDs in advance. While in Dynamic 
Routing, the originator and forwarders of a message have no 
idea who may need it and where they are. To disseminate road 
information in the network quickly and widely, Wischhof et al. 
proposed a simple message dissemination algorithm in [6], 
which broadcasts messages road by road firstly. Then, through 
measuring some road condition parameters such as car density 
and average speed, forwarders may adjust the broadcast 
interval to decrease communication overhead. 
Yang et al. evaluated the effectiveness of Dynamic 
Routing and the feasibility of broadcast interval adjustment 
through simulation in [7]. Meanwhile they also found that 
relay candidates’ vehicle information can be very useful in 
selecting a good relay. Similar results also appeared in [8]. 
From another perspective, Leontiadis et al. argued that 
there is no need to broadcast all cached congestion warning 
messages in a junction. Applying gossip algorithm, the 
Computer-Assisted Traveling Environment (CATE) model 
they proposed defines a utility function and selectively 
broadcasts a sample of messages [9]. The simulation results 
show that it still achieves a notable trip-time improvement. 
III. DIRECTION-ASSISTED GEOGRAPHIC RELAY MODEL 
A. Assumptions and Proposed Model 
The urban map is modeled as a weighted graph in 
Dynamic Routing. Each road segment is associated with a 
travel time as a weight. The default value is computed 
dividing the segment’s length by the speed limit. Once a 
vehicle’s time spent in a road segment surpasses a travel delay 
threshold, a CW message consisting of road ID and travel 
delay will be originated and broadcast. This message would be 
spread into the network, ether in an Ad Hoc or in an 
opportunistic mode. Upon receiving the message, receivers 
update their local weighted graphs and apply Shortest Path 
Algorithms (mostly Dijkstra) to re-compute new routes. 
Discussions in previous researches have revealed that in the 
process of selecting a relay, motion information of candidates, 
e.g., position, direction and route, may improve final trip-time 
dramatically. Since drivers might regard routes and directions 
as privacy, advertising this information might not be plausible. 
We propose a new geo-based dissemination model for 
Dynamic Routing, named Direction-Assisted Geographic 
Relay (DAGR). In this model, the holder of a message just 
simply broadcasts it in certain conditions and every vehicle 
ov  that overhears the message decides whether to carry it or 
not. The decision-making process depends on 
ov ’s direction 
and its relative position with the message originator 
a
v . 
In our scenario, vehicles are categorized into 4 types. 
1) Non-equipped vehicle: Vehicles that are NOT equipped 
with SRDs and do NO rerouting. 
2) Public vehicle: Vehicles that ALWAYS originate and 
forward CW messages selflessly when necessary and do 
rerouting with them, e.g., police cars, buses. 
3) Private vehicle: Vehicles that NEITHER originate nor 
forward CW messages. But they DO rerouting with messages 
overheard from others. 
4) Group vehicle: Vehicles that originate and forward 
messages ONLY when there are vehicles of the same group in 
vicinity, e.g., cars of the same taxi company. 
As to the adversary model, faking congestion warning to 
divert traffic to other areas is studied in [9], and it turned out 
that it required a significant size of misbehaving nodes (>22% 
of the total vehicles) to collaborate to make vehicles’ trip-time 
deteriorate notably. So, in our model, the selfishness of 
vehicles is regarded as the passive attitude in message 
exchanging instead of broadcasting malicious messages. To 
inform 1-hop neighbors of their existences, Public and Group 
vehicles broadcast short HELLO beacons constantly, while 
Private vehicles always keep silent and just reroute with CW 
messages overheard from others. So, they are just free-riders.   
B. Dissemination Performance Metric 
The design goal of our dissemination model is to enhance 
the forward efficiency of CW messages. This means that 
vehicles in the scenario should only carry and forward 
messages most likely to make contribution to traffic-jam 
avoidance, instead of simply forwarding every message they 
overheard. In fact, most CW messages are of no use to a given 
vehicle if it contains no roads that consist of the vehicle’s 
route. So, we need a new metric rather than simple delivery 
ratio when evaluating dissemination performance in Dynamic 
Routing. Before any further discussion, Table I lists some

The 
Broadcast 
Procedure 
takes 
vehicle’s 
rational 
selfishness into consideration. After verifying that the cached 
CW does not expire,
ov iterates its 1-hop neighbor set to check 
whether there is any vehicle from the same group in vicinity 
(the first condition at line 4, Public vehicles bypass this step). 
If the test is positive, a broadcast attempt is initiated. 
The second condition 
clvo
u
t  t
is to avoid the situation 
where
vo
and u might have kept their 1-hop neighbor 
relationship for a long time and 
o
v could broadcast one 
message repeatedly for u  even though u  has received it 
successfully before. 
The contention-based broadcasting mode described in [10] 
is further introduced in case that several vehicles holding the 
same CW messages might do the broadcasting repeatedly at 
one junction. Under such circumstance, vehicles would 
suppress their broadcast attempt if the CW message it was 
going to broadcast is just overheard. 
IV. EVALUATION 
Mobility 
decision 
and 
message 
dissemination 
are 
influenced by each other in Dynamic Routing. To study the 
CW dissemination performance and its impact on vehicles’ 
trip-time, we evaluate DAGR on an integrated simulation 
platform consisting of traffic simulator sumo [11] and network 
simulator ns2, which two are coupled through TraCI protocol. 
A. Simulation Tools 
Fig. 4 shows the simulator architecture. To achieve 
synchronization between two simulators, ns2 which acts as a 
TraCI client, sends SIMSTEP commands constantly to trigger 
the simulation process of sumo from step k-1 to step k. Then 
sumo sends back all equipped vehicles’ Cartesian coordinates 
to ns2. The latter updates all ns nodes’ destination positions 
and start the network simulation process of step k. sumo keeps 
the map between vehicle’s sumo node ID and ns node ID [12]. 
B. Simulation Setup 
The simulation is focused on two aspects: 1. DAGR’s 
forwarding 
efficiency. 
2. 
Vehicles 
overall 
trip-time 
improvements. 
 
 
The scenario is based on the map of Nanjing, Jiangsu 
province, China, from OpenStreetMap project [13]. It covers 
8500m×9500m downtown area of the city, containing 267 
junctions and 731 road segments. The speed limit of each road 
segment is greater than 40km/h. 996 out of the total 1984 
vehicles are equipped with SRDs. These equipped vehicles are 
divided into 1 Private vehicle group, 1 Public vehicle group 
and 2 Group vehicle groups. DAGR and Convention strategies 
are tested respectively in the same scenario to compare their 
performance on the effective-hit numbers and forwarding 
overheads. 
1) Convention Strategy: All equipped vehicles will carry 
every message they overheard and broadcast them at every 
junction before these messages expire. It’s a brutal but classic 
strategy, adopted by many researches (like [1][2][6]) to 
achieve a high delivery ratio. In the simulation, this strategy 
gives an upper bound in terms of effective hit number. 
2) DAGR Strategy: As described in Section III, Private 
vehicles carry and forward nothing and only do rerouting with 
CWs overheard; Public and Group vehicles apply Procedure 1 
and 2 in their Carry and Broadcast processes. 
Before the simulation starts, departure and destination of 
each vehicle are generated randomly. The straight line distance 
between two points must larger than 4000m. This guarantees 
enough traffic crossing the city. The departure time of vehicles 
is set between 1—200s uniformly, which means there are 
about 10 vehicles depart per second. Road travel delay 
threshold is set to 150s, about 3 times of the traffic light 
duration, which means that if one fails to pass a road segment 
in two green-light periods, a conclusion can be drawn that 
congestion happened. Taking the scenario map size and road 
segment length into consideration, for simplicity the usual ns2 
802.11b (with TwoRayGround propagation model) is used. 
The receiving threshold is adapted to achieve a 
transmission distance of 300m. As to the message 
expiration, time decay factor is set to 0.98 and threshold is set 
to 0.05 to keep the life time of a message at about 150s, which 
is the travel delay threshold. Other simulation parameters are 
listed in Table II.

C. Dissemination Efficiency 
In Fig. 5, we plot the number of effective hits and 
forwarding attempts for Convention and DAGR, respectively. 
As we see, DAGR achieves almost the same number of 
effective hits as that of Convention with only 31.5% of its 
forwarding overhead. In total, DAGR got 912 effective hits 
with 2276 forwards while Convention got 936 effective hits 
with 7210 forwards. Furthermore, if we define Forwarding 
Efficiency (FE) of a vehicle group G as the average number of 
effective hits caused by a single forward that vehicles of G 
make.

           (2) 
 
 
Fig. 6 shows how each group’s forward efficiency changes 
with time. We note that the most influential factor of the 
forward efficiency is group size instead of vehicle groups’ 
different carrying and broadcasting strategies. Public vehicles 
in group G1 broadcast CW messages in every road segment 
before they expire, while vehicles in group G3 broadcast only 
when there are partners from the same group in vicinity. Yet, 
such a selfish strategy in broadcasting does not diminish 
forwarding efficiency. More specifically, each forward of 
vehicles in G1 result in 0.31 effective hit, in G3 result in 0.4 
effective hit and in G2 result in 0.87 effective hit.  
As discussed before, vehicles may use messages overheard 
from other groups. We call this spillover effect. To understand 
how broadcasting strategy influence spillover effect, we define 
spillover ratio as: 
causedby G
effhit
G s effhitcausedby G
effhitcausedby G
spilloverratioof G
'


.  (3) 
The spillover ratio of G1, G2 and G3 is 11.5, 3.08 and 5.38 
respectively. This means among every 12.5 effective hits 
caused by G1 vehicles, 11.5 hits are contributed to vehicles of 
other groups. It seems that Public vehicles do more for public 
welfare. However, if we look each group’s FE again, the 
largest 
group 
G2 
with 
a 
0.87, 
still 
contributes 
0.87×3.08/(1+3.08)=0.66 effective hit to other groups per 
forward, higher than G1’s 0.23 and G3’s 0.34. 
D. Trip-Time Improvement 
We evaluate the trip-time gain/loss of our model with 
metrics named Trip-Time Decrease/Increase Ratio, defined in 
CATE [9]. Fig. 7 shows the comparison between CATE and 
DAGR. oldtime refers to vehicle’s trip-time when Dynamic 
Routing is not used and newtime refers to the one when 
Dynamic Routing is adopted. The Decrease Ratio is defined as 
ratio=oldtime/newtime. Obviously, the greater this ratio is, the 
more time Dynamic Routing saved. Similarly, Increase Ratio 
is defined as ratio=newtime/oldtime. If the variation of this 
ratio is within 
10%
 trip-time, we think the vehicle is not 
affected in terms of trip-time. 
The trip-time saving effect of Dynamic Routing is not as 
significant as we used to expect. As we may see, most vehicles 
in both models get either a slight improvement (33% in CATE 
and 16% in DAGR, ratio less than 1.25) or no improvement 
(23% in CATE and 45% in DAGR, not drawn in histograms). 
CATE’s performance seems to be slightly better than DAGR 
and their distribution are roughly consistent. One point that 
should be kept in mind is that, since CATE adopts a 
replica-based forwarding mechanism while DAGR is a 
geo-based algorithm, they are two orthogonal techniques and 
may be combined to achieve a better performance. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A. Conclusion 
Through discussion and simulation above, we can 
conclude that in Dynamic Routing, Direction-Assisted 
Geographic 
Relay 
can decrease forwarding overhead 
dramatically without sacrificing dissemination performance 
compared with Convention forwarding strategy. In addition, 
we also find that the group size is the most influential factor of 
forwarding efficiency despite of different 
forwarding 
strategies of vehicle groups. Even if we take spillover effect 
into consideration, vehicles from large-size groups still make 
more contributions to the total effective hit gain. As to the 
trip-time improvement, nearly 25% of vehicles notably benefit 
from Dynamic Routing while the trip-time of the rest remains 
almost unchanged (
25%
 trip-time). 
B. Future Work 
The DAGR model in this paper is specially tailored for 
Dynamic Routing and may not support other vehicular 
network applications, especially those requiring a high 
real-time performance and cooperation between vehicles, such 
as traffic safety applications. To build a general dissemination 
model is a very challenging and meaningful task and certainly 
a lot of factors about performance, security and privacy need 
to be taken into consideration. 
During the simulation, we set two DAGR’s angle

optimal choice still needs to be investigated, both theoretically 
and experimentally. Furthermore, the urban scenario still 
needs more improvements and different ratios of vehicles will 
be evaluated to figure out how these parameters influence the 
system performance. 
Last but not least, messages from other groups may not be 
trusted completely in real life for security considerations. 
Trust management between different vehicles is still an 
unsolved problem. Some trust models for vehicular network 
have been proposed, but they still need to be tailored for 
specific applications and their effectiveness yet need to be 
evaluated in realistic scenarios.
