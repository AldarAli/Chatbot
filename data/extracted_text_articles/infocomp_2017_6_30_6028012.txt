Abstract—The present study aimed to find patterns in free 
word associations. Associations were gathered from two 
nationally comprehensive samples in Hungary (N1 = 505; N2 = 
505) to the cue “migrant”. We demonstrated that network 
analysis based on co-occurrences reveals distinct clusters based 
on attitudes and emotions.

 INTRODUCTION 
Our social environment provides access to a large 
amount of information on social phenomena. This 
information is accumulated and shared via communication. 
In social psychology, the collection of opinions shared by a 
social group regarding a social object is called a social 
representation [1]. Social representation studies frequently 
apply free associations [2]. However, the data-driven 
grouping 
of 
associations 
reflecting 
psychologically 
meaningful dimensions is a challenge to social psychology. 
Furthermore, opinions have a dynamic nature [3] and they 
can also polarize into multiple views [4].  
In Section 2, we describe the procedure and the methods. 
In Section 3, we summarize our results. In Section 4, we 
discuss results and limitations. In Section 5, we point out 
prospects for future work.   
II. 
METHODS AND PROCEDURE 
We gathered multiple response free associations from 
two nationally comprehensive samples in Hungary (N1 = 
505; N2 = 505) and the cue was the word ‘migrant’ 
(currently a highly sensitive societal issue in Europe). Each 
respondent had to associate five words. We also applied a 
psychological measure to assess respondents’ attitudes 
toward migrants (validated Hungarian version [5] of the 
Social Distance (SD) scale [6]). We constructed networks 
from these associations for both samples separately. Nodes 
were the different associations. Edge weights were defined 
based on co-occurrences in individual responses. To find 
psychologically-relevant dimensions behind individual 
opinions, we used module detection (Louvain algorithm [7] 
and consensus partitioning [8]). We validated the modular 
structure with the help of the SD scale. Independent sample 
t-tests were applied with Bonferroni correction.

RESULTS 
The two most frequent associations are displayed in 
Table I. and Table II. for Sample 1 and Sample 2, 
respectively.

In case of Sample 1, respondents assigned to the Module 
1 showed the lowest SD score. (M = 3.9, SD = 2.2). 
Respondents assigned to Module 2 reported higher level of 
SD score (M = 4.6, SD = 2.2). Respondents assigned to the 
Module 3 reported even higher level of SD score (M = 5.2, 
SD = 2.1). Respondents assigned to Module 4 showed the 
highest SD score (M = 6, SD = 1.6). Module 1 showed 
significantly lower score than Module 2 (t(481) = -3.4, p = 
.02), Module 3 (t(484) = -6.4, p < .001) and Module 4 
(t(600) = -13.3, p < .001.) Module 2 had significantly lower 
d SD score than Module 3 (t(403)=-2.6, p<.001) and 
Module 4 (t(519) = -7.8, p < .001.) Module 3 had 
significantly lower SD score than Module 4 (t(522) = -4.9, p 
< .001).

In case of Sample 2 respondents assigned to Module 1 
showed the lowest SD score (M = 4.4, SD = 2.2). 
Respondents assigned to Module 2 (M = 5.1, SD = 2). 
Respondents assigned to Module 3 showed the highest SD 
score (M = 6.2, SD = 1.5). Module 1 had significantly lower 
SD score than Module 2 (t(597) = -4, p < 0.001) and 
Module 3 (t(717) = -12.4, p < .001). Module 3 had 
significantly lower SD score than Module 4 (t(602) = -6.9, p 
< 0.001).

DISCUSSION 
Our results indicate that module detection in association 
networks yields a psychologically meaningful mapping of 
the rich symbolic context behind attitudes in a structured 
way. The modules reflected distinct attitudes toward asylum 
seekers based on pairwise statistical comparisons of attitude 
scores between respondents who were affiliated with 
different modules.  
 Our networks can be seen as a subtype of large-scale 
semantic networks [9]–[11] map constant lexical relations 
among words of a language. As opposed to these models, 
our study focuses on a single social object which generates 
polarized opinions. Furthermore, opinions in social issues 
fluctuate over time [3]. They can be significantly reshaped 
by events (e.g., war, terrorism or economic changes). Such 
changes can be observed in our social representation 
networks. For example, the association “terrorism” is one of 
the most frequent associations in both samples, which is in 
line with previous results on the stability of frequent 
components [1]. However, it appeared in completely 
different contexts in the two samples. In the first sample, it 
had a stereotypical connection to Arab/Islam-related 
concepts (this associative relation had already been found 
before the current migration-related events by other 
researchers as well [12]). In the second sample, its 
frequency increased and it had stronger relations to other 
associations indicating threat, violence and crime. A 
possible explanation can be that in the time-interval between 
the two data gatherings, a significant terror attack happened 
in Nice in July, 2016 and this event could be perceived as 
result of the increased number of migrants after the Syrian 
war. A future study could investigate how social 
representations are updated according to changes in the 
environment. 
A limitation is that multiple response free associations 
are sparse datasets. As a consequence of sparsity, we have 
to be careful with interpretations based on a single 
connection in our networks and rely more on the modules 
which are derived from multiple connections. Another 
limitation is that the method was demonstrated regarding 
only one social object. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Our research can provide an empirical basis for 
constructing knowledge graphs to analyze texts in political, 
social and ideological domains. Modules constructed from 
individual word usage patterns indicated significantly 
different attitudes toward migrants. Human respondents 
provide more relevant associations than corpus-based 
association extraction [13]. The downside is that collecting 
associations from human respondents is tedious, the datasets 
can be sparse and they expire. However, combining human 
associations with extracted associations yields a promising 
performance [13]. This implies that associations can be used 
as representative signals to build more comprehensive 
databases for text comprehending in a given domain. For 
example, our empirically-validated word clustering can be 
extended with web-mining and natural language processing 
techniques.
