Abstract— This paper discusses technology acceptance in the 
context 
of 
Ambient 
Intelligence 
(AmI) 
environments. 
Determining what would make a technology acceptable by 
users was widely recognized as a significant field of research 
since the seventies. Ever since several models have been 
developed, while recent advances in technology have led to 
increased research interest in assessing technology acceptance 
in a variety of domains. This has resulted in a plethora of 
studies and an extensive number of parameters that can be 
considered important towards predicting the acceptance of a 
given technology by its target audience. An important concern 
is how to practically employ these models for the assessment of 
AmI environments, given their high complexity and the wide 
range of potential contexts and target users. To this end, this 
paper carries out a review of the most important models and 
their evolution over time, as well as a review of studies 
extending these models in a variety of domains beyond the 
workplace. Furthermore, a classification of the parameters 
studied across these models is carried out, identifying a 
common feature across existing technology acceptance studies, 
namely that all assessments are based on self-reported metrics. 
This highlights the need for a synergistic evaluation approach, 
where assessment will move beyond self-reported or observed 
metrics and will be supported and assisted by the AmI 
environment itself.

INTRODUCTION 
Determining what would make a technology acceptable 
by users was widely recognized as a significant field of 
research since the seventies, when approaches towards 
defining factors that seem to influence the use of technology 
have been proposed. Nevertheless, it was in the mid-eighties 
when researchers concentrated their efforts on developing 
and testing models that could help predicting system use [1]. 
Several theoretical models have been proposed to this end, 
with roots in information systems, psychology, and 
sociology 
[2]. 
Over 
time, 
as 
new 
technological 
advancements occurred, the research interest in technology 
acceptance moved beyond the workplace (where technology 
and more specifically computers were initially used) to other 
domains and contexts of use. 
Ambient Intelligence is an emerging field of research and 
development, constituting a new technological paradigm, 
moving beyond the Ubiquitous Computing paradigm. The 
notion of Ambient Intelligence is becoming a de facto key 
dimension of  today’s Information  Society,  spanning  across  
every  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  research  and 
development domain, since next generation digital products 
and services are explicitly designed  in  view  of  an  overall  
intelligent  computational  environment [3]. Although 
Ambient Intelligence is a multidisciplinary field, its objective 
is to offer proper services to users, therefore the implications 
of user evaluation should be considered in this “service-
evaluation-research” loop [4]. 
As AmI environments are equipped with various sensors 
and monitoring capabilities, privacy and trust become issues 
of paramount importance for their inhabitants [5], while 
technology acceptance needs to be studied from a new 
perspective. Ambient Intelligence may be found in any 
potential daily living environment, such as the home, the 
workplace, health care, educational setting, or public spaces 
[6], 
embracing 
any 
activity 
carried 
out 
in 
these 
environments. Therefore, the parameters that may impact 
user acceptance of an Ambient Intelligence environment 
definitely extend beyond the parameters suggested in the first 
models studying computer acceptance in workplace 
environments. As a first step towards studying acceptance in 
AmI environments, this paper carries out a short review of 
the initial technology acceptance models and their evolution, 
as well as their adaptations to address different contexts of 
use. Furthermore, a classification of the parameters studied 
in these models is provided, with the aim to assist 
researchers in identifying parameters that should be included 
in studying user acceptance of AmI environments, according 
to the target environment and context of use. 
The purpose of this paper is not to carry out a detailed 
literature review; instead, it focuses on identifying 
parameters that have been suggested to influence technology 
adoption in various contexts. Therefore, the main criteria for 
including a paper in this review were: (i) the paper should 
propose a specific model directly relevant with technology 
acceptance, and (ii) at least one novel variable should be 
contributed by the model. The main focus of this work is on 
proposing a classification of the parameters explored in such 
models and - through this - highlight the potential of moving 
from self-rated experiences towards technology-assisted 
assessment of user experience in Ambient Intelligence 
environments.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces 
the most significant technology acceptance and adoption 
models, while Section 3 presents models for technology 
acceptance beyond the organizational context, organized in 
categories. Section 4 provides a classification of the 
parameters examined in the presented models. Section 5 
concludes the paper by discussing directions towards 
technology acceptance assessment in AmI environments. 
II. 
TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE 
One of the most influential models, the Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM), has been proposed by Davis [7] 
and defines two components that affect a user’s attitude 
towards using a technology, namely: (i) perceived 
usefulness, described as the degree to which an individual 
believes that using a particular system would enhance their 
job performance and (ii) perceived ease of use, defined as the 
degree to which an individual believes that using a particular 
system would be free of physical and mental effort. 
Extending the initial TAM model and taking into account 
theoretical constructs spanning from social influence 
processes to cognitive instrumental processes, Venkatesh and 
Davis introduced the TAM2 model [8], which added seven 
components to the initial TAM model, and namely: 
 
Subjective norm: a person’s perception that most 
people who are important to him think he should or 
should not perform the behavior in question. 
 
Voluntariness: the extent to which potential adopters 
perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory.  
 
Image: the degree to which use of an innovation is 
perceived to enhance one’s status in one’s social 
system.  
 
Experience: the experience gained while using a 
given technology over time.  
 
Job relevance: an individual’s perception regarding 
the degree to which the target system is applicable to 
his or her job. 
 
Output quality: how well the system performs tasks. 
 
Result demonstrability: the tangibility of the results 
using the innovation. 
TAM has been widely adopted and studied by the 
research community, resulting in a considerable number of 
external variables that have been introduced as factors 
influencing how users perceive the usefulness and ease of 
use of a technology, while reviews of TAM have constituted 
the objective of several meta-studies  [9]-[11]. Variables 
extending the initial TAM model include [9]:  
 
Relative advantage: the degree to which an 
innovation is perceived as being better than its 
precursor. 
 
Compatibility: the degree to which an innovation is 
perceived as being consistent with the existing 
values, needs, and past experiences of potential 
adopters. 
 
Trialability: the degree to which an innovation may 
be experimented with before adoption. 
 
Self-efficacy: an individual’s convictions about his 
or her abilities to mobilize motivation, cognitive 
resources and courses of action needed to 
successfully execute a specific task within a given 
context.  
 
End user support: specialized instruction, guidance, 
coaching and consulting.  
 
Objective usability: the actual level of system effect 
on the completion of specific tasks. 
 
Personal innovativeness: the individual’s willingness 
to try out any new technology. 
 
Cognitive playfulness: the individual’s cognitive 
spontaneity when using a technology. 
 
Social presence: the degree to which a medium 
permits users to experience others as being 
psychologically present.  
 
Visibility: the degree to which the innovation is 
visible in the organization. 
 
Computer attitude: the degree to which a person 
likes or dislikes the object. 
 
Accessibility: physical and information accessibility.  
 
Management support: the degree of support from 
managers to ensure sufficient allocation of resources.  
 
Computer anxiety: an individual’s apprehension, or 
even fear, when she/he is faced with the possibility 
of using computers. 
 
Perceived enjoyment: the extent to which the activity 
of using a specific system is perceived to be 
enjoyable in its own right, aside from any 
performance consequences resulting from system 
usage. 
 
Facilitating conditions: resource factors (such as 
time and money) and technology compatibility 
issues that may constrain usage. 
Addressing the need for defining the determinants of 
perceived ease of use, TAM3 was proposed [12] by 
extending TAM 2 to include the following determinants: 
computer self-efficacy, perception of external control, 
computer 
anxiety, 
computer 
playfulness, 
perceived 
enjoyment and objective usability. 
Following a different approach, Thompson, Higgins, and 
Howell [13] utilized a subset of the theory of human 
behavior [14] to create a model of personal computer 
utilization. Applying this theory implied that the utilization 
of a Personal Computer (PC) by a knowledge worker in an 
optional use environment would be influenced by the 
individual’s feelings toward using PCs, social norms in the 
work place concerning PC use, habits associated with 
computer usage, the individual’s expected consequences of 
using a PC, and facilitating conditions in the environment 
conducive to PC use. 
A significant theoretical framework in the area of 
technology diffusion and adoption was proposed by Rogers 
[15] and described the innovation-diffusion process as an 
uncertainty reduction process. Five attributes of innovation 
were proposed, which are important for technology adoption: 
relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, 
and observability. Other variables determining the rate of 
adoption of innovations are: the type of innovation decision 
(optional, collective, authority), the communication channels 
39

used to diffuse an innovation, the nature of the social 
systems (its norms and the degree to which the 
communication network structure is highly interconnected), 
as well as the promotion efforts of change agents. Moore and 
Benbasat [16] also adopted the Innovation Diffusion Theory 
(IDT), and further extended it with two constructs, namely 
image and voluntariness of use. Tornatzky and Klein [17] 
carried out a review and meta-analysis of seventy-five 
articles concerned with innovation characteristics and their 
relationship to innovation adoption and implementation, and 
extracted ten characteristics as the most important and 
frequent ones, five of which are the attributes of innovation 
of IDT. The additional five innovation characteristics are:  
 
Cost: the cost of an innovation is assumed to be 
negatively 
related 
to 
the 
adoption 
and 
implementation of the innovation; the less expensive 
the innovation, the more likely it will be quickly 
adopted and implemented. 
 
Communicability: the degree to which aspects of an 
innovation may be conveyed to others. 
 
Divisibility: the extent to which an innovation can be 
tried on a small scale prior to adoption, which is 
closely related to trialability. 
 
Profitability: the level of profit to be gained from 
adoption of the innovation. 
 
Social approval: refers to status gained in one’s 
reference group, a nonfinancial aspect of reward as a 
function of adopting a particular innovation. 
With the aim to facilitate researchers confronted with a 
choice among a multitude of models, Venkatesh et al. [18] 
proposed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology (UTAUT). According to this theory, four 
constructs are direct determinants of user acceptance and 
user behavior: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence and facilitating conditions. In addition, four 
moderators have been identified for the aforementioned 
determinants, 
namely 
gender, 
age, 
experience, 
and 
voluntariness of use. An extension to the UTAUT model, 
named UTAUT2, has been proposed by Venkatesh, Thong, 
& Xu [19] to study acceptance and use of technology in a 
consumer 
context 
and 
incorporates 
three 
additional 
constructs:  
 
Hedonic motivation: the fun or pleasure derived 
from using a technology. 
 
Price value: the consumers’ cognitive trade-off 
between the perceived benefits of the applications 
and the monetary cost for using them. 
 
Habit: the extent to which people tend to 
automatically perform learnt behaviors. 
III. 
TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE BEYOND THE 
WORKPLACE 
The majority of the aforementioned fundamental models 
have initially been applied in organizational settings and 
examined technology adoption in the workplace context, 
since when they were initially created, computers were not 
used in the home or other environments, while technology 
mostly referred to PC usage. Recent advances in technology 
have led however to increased research interest in assessing 
technology acceptance in a variety of domains. This section 
reports on efforts utilizing or extending the aforementioned 
models by adding new variables, towards assessing other 
contexts or technologies, focusing on the most prevalent 
contexts, as well as contexts relevant to AmI (e.g., 
ubiquitous computing, Ambient Assisted Living). 
A. Technology Adoption in Households 
As a result of studying technology adoption in 
households, Brown and Venkatesh [20] introduced the 
Model of Adoption of Technology in Households (MATH), 
which includes the following constructs: 
 
Utilitarian outcomes, which can be divided into 
beliefs related to personal use, children, and work. 
 
Hedonic outcomes, defined as the pleasure derived 
from the consumption, or use, of a product. 
 
Social outcomes, which are described as the “public” 
recognition that would be achieved as a result of 
adopting an innovation. 
 
Social influence that is the extent to which members 
of a social network influence one another’s behavior, 
and can be further classified into friends and family 
influences, secondary sources influences, as well as 
workplace referents’ influences. 
 
External constraints, which are characteristics of the 
PC and its environment and include the rapid change 
in technology and/or fear of obsolescence, declining 
cost, and cost. 
 
Internal constraints, reflecting perceptions of the 
individual’s relationship with technology and 
include the perceived ease of use and requisite 
knowledge. 
Furthermore, 
the 
model 
defines 
the 
following 
moderators, which are related to household life: marital 
status, age, child’s age and income. 
B. World Wide Web (WWW) 
Moon and Kim [21] extended and empirically validated 
TAM for the WWW context. The results of their study 
indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and 
perceived playfulness are important determinants of users’ 
perceptions towards using the WWW, but also that 
playfulness and perceived ease of use (intrinsic motivations) 
had a more powerful impact than perceived usefulness 
(extrinsic motivation) in the case of the WWW. The effect of 
Internet experience and website experience has also been 
studied, highlighting the positive impact of experience [22].  
More specifically, it was found that in users with high 
experience, (a) the influence of perceived usefulness on the 
process of forming the attitude to the website is substantially 
greater than in users with low experience, while (b) the 
influence of perceived ease of use on the attitude towards the 
website is substantially smaller than in users with low 
experience.  
C. Gaming and Virtual Worlds 
In the domain of WWW and especially with regard to 
online games, TAM was extended with the constructs of 
40
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2017.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-601-9
AMBIENT 2017 : The Seventh International Conference on Ambient Computing, Applications, Services and Technologies

social norms, critical mass and flow experience [23], 
concluding that social norms and flow affect users’ intention 
to play an online game, while critical mass affects users’ 
attitude towards playing an online game, but not intention 
directly. Perceived connectedness and perceived mobility 
were constructs introduced in the domain of mobile social 
network games [24]. Focusing on serious games, Yusoff, 
Crowder, and Gilbert extended TAM with the concepts of 
transfer of learnt skills, learner control, reward, as well as 
situated and authentic learning [25].  In the context of virtual 
worlds, 
the 
application 
of 
TAM 
highlighted 
that 
communication, collaboration, and cooperation are central in 
influencing behavioral intention to use and acceptance of the 
virtual world [26]. 
D. Trading, Shopping and Internet banking 
The moderating effect of perceived trust has been 
explored as an extension of TAM in the context of online 
trading systems [27]. Testing the model supported that trust 
is an important antecedent of user acceptance in this context, 
and that perceived security affects user’s trust. Trust and 
perceived risk have also been added as extensions to TAM 
with regard to e-commerce in order to study the user’s 
intention to transact [28], [29]. Studies that have been carried 
out to test the extended TAM [28] indicated that trust is 
positively associated with intention to transact, perceived 
usefulness and perceived ease of use, and negatively 
associated with perceived risk. Furthermore, reputation was a 
significant antecedent of intention to transact, and along with 
satisfaction with past transactions and web shopping 
frequency, they were significant antecedents of trust. The 
concept of consumer trust has been extensively studied and 
further decomposed in the antecedents of personality-based, 
cognition-based, knowledge-based, calculative-based and 
institution-based trust [30]. 
Previous experience with the Internet was found to be of 
significant importance for both initial and repeated 
purchases, while users who consider that they have more 
competence and capacity also have better perceptions about 
e-commerce and, as a consequence, carry out more online 
purchases [31].  E-shopping quality is another factor that was 
found to be influential in perceptions of usefulness, trust, and 
enjoyment, which in turn influence consumers' attitudes 
toward e-shopping [32]. In this study, e-shopping quality 
consists of four dimensions, namely web site design, 
customer service, privacy / security and atmospheric / 
experiential quality. 
The role of perceived risk, as well as that of perceived 
benefit, have been included in a TAM extension studying 
user acceptance of internet banking [33]. In more details, the 
results of the study confirmed that perceived benefit has a 
primary effect on intention to use online banking, as well as 
that security, financial, time, social, and performance risks 
all emerged as negative factors in the intention to adopt 
online banking. Risks have been further explored and 
analyzed as a parameter for e-services adoption by 
Featherman and Pavlou [34], comprising the facets of 
performance, financial, time, psychological, social, privacy 
and overall risk. 
E. eLearning and mLearning 
In the context of eLearning, the TAM model has been 
expanded to include system characteristics, and more 
specifically: (i) functionality, which refers to the perceived 
ability of a eLearning system to provide flexible access to 
instructional and assessment media, (ii) interactivity, which 
refers to interaction support between teachers and students, 
and students themselves, and (iii) response time [35]. The 
model also included the user attributes of self-efficacy and 
internet experience, and studied the impact of the 
aforementioned factors on perceived usefulness and 
perceived ease of use, as well as the use of the system for 
supplementary learning and for distance education. Saadé 
and Bahli [36] extended TAM, taking into account the 
moderating effect of cognitive absorption, which in turn is 
defined by the user’s temporal dissociation, focused 
immersion and heightened enjoyment when using the online 
learning system. The role of cognitive absorption, as well as 
system attributes has been pointed out in a TAM extension 
based on the expectancy disconfirmation theory [37]. The 
results of the study suggest that continuance intention is 
determined by satisfaction, which in turn is jointly 
determined by perceived usefulness, information quality, 
confirmation, service quality, system quality, perceived ease 
of use and cognitive absorption.  
eLearning self-efficacy, followed by subjective norm, 
have been emphasized as the most important constructs 
explaining eLearning technology adoption by university 
students [38]. The role of eLearning experience on 
continuance intention has also been explored by Lin [39], 
highlighting that (i) negative critical incidents and attitude 
are the main determinants of the users’ intention to continue 
using the e-learning, irrespective of their level of e-learning 
experience, (ii) the impact of negative critical incidents on 
perceived ease of use is greater for less experienced users, 
while the impact of negative critical incidents on perceived 
usefulness is greater for more experienced users; and (iii) 
perceived ease of use has a more critical effect on the 
attitude and continuance intention of less experienced users, 
whereas perceived usefulness is found to be a stronger 
determinant of the attitude and behavioral intention of more 
experienced users.  The importance of digital literacy in 
eLearning use for professional development has been 
stressed in a study extending the UTAUT model [40], which 
found that digital literacy has an impact on users' 
performance and effort expectations that in turn affect 
continuance intention and eventually performance. The 
adoption of IT by educators has also constituted the subject 
of several studies, highlighting that digital competencies and 
institutional support have an important role in adoption 
intentions [41].  
On the other hand, in terms of mLearning adoption 
intention, near-term usefulness, long-term usefulness and 
personal innovativeness have proved to have significant 
influence, with the most important predictor being long-term 
usefulness [42]. Mobile technology adoption by educators 
has been claimed to be influenced, among others, by mobile 
device anxiety, as well as resistance to change, defined as the 
41

difficulty to break with routines and the emotional stress 
generated [43]. 
eLearning is a domain in which many studies have been 
carried out in terms of user acceptance. A meta-analysis of 
eLearning technology acceptance studies [44] identified that 
TAM is indeed the most-used acceptance theory in the 
specific context, but more importantly that the size of the 
causal effects between individual TAM-related factors 
depends on the type of e-learning technology. 
F. Mobile Technology 
Advances in mobile technology have led to increased 
interest in exploring adoption intentions and acceptance of 
services in this domain. Lu, Yao, & Yu [45] modified TAM 
to explore adoption of wireless internet services via mobile 
technology, and found strong causal relationships between 
social influences, personal innovativeness and the perceptual 
beliefs—usefulness and ease of use, which in turn impact 
adoption intentions. A model has been proposed by Nysveen, 
Pedersen, & Thorbjørnsen [46], integrating the motives that 
are revealed in information systems theories, uses and 
gratification theory, and domestication theory and examining 
four mobile services, namely text messaging, contact, 
payment, and gaming. The model includes the motivational 
influences of usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment, and 
expressiveness, attitude towards using the mobile services, 
normative pressure as a social influence, and behavioral 
control reflecting resource-related influences such as the 
user’s economy, experience and skills in using a service. The 
results indicate that attitude towards using the service is 
moderated by enjoyment, usefulness, and ease of use, while 
users’ intention to use the service is moderated by attitude 
towards the service, expressiveness, enjoyment, usefulness, 
ease of use, normative pressure and behavioral control. 
Taking into account TAM, as well as other models extending 
it for e-commerce acceptance, Fang, Chan, Brzezinski, & Xu 
[47] propose a new model focusing on mobile commerce 
identifying the moderating effects of task type on technology 
acceptance. A study was carried out to test the proposed 
model, and the results highlight that perceived usefulness 
and perceived ease of use were important to user intention to 
perform general tasks that do not involve transactions and 
gaming on wireless handheld devices, while perceptions of 
playfulness influence user intention to play games using 
wireless technology, and user intention to transact on 
handheld devices is affected by perceived usefulness and 
perceived security.  
The role of context in the user acceptance of mobile 
systems was highlighted and studied for mobile ticketing 
systems [48]. The results of the study indicated that the 
context of use has an important effect on intention to use the 
mobile service, as well as a mediating effect of perceived 
usability on user intention, while other decision factors, such 
as ease of use and compatibility, had a direct effect. 
Considering the mobility context, Zarmpou, Saprikis, 
Markos, and Vlachopoulou [49] extended TAM and 
introduced the concept of relationship drivers as those 
dimensions that create a relationship between the consumers 
and the m-services, including for instance the time and 
location personalization of m-services, their adaptation to the 
consumers’ profile, the consumers’ dynamic permission 
option and the consumers’ reward by the use of the m-
services. Testing the model highlighted that relationship 
drivers have an important effect on perceived usefulness and 
behavioral intention. 
G. Health Technology 
Although the success of health Information Technology 
(IT) certainly goes beyond user acceptance, where users may 
be health professionals or patients, increasing interest in this 
application domain has raised the importance of theories that 
predict and explain health IT acceptance and use [50]. Such 
theories are based on existing models, such as TAM, while 
findings of reviews and meta-studies highlight that TAM 
predicts a substantial portion of user acceptance of health IT, 
however several additions and modifications have been 
proposed [50]. 
An alternative approach to extending TAM aimed at 
identifying barriers to health IT adoption, instead of 
extending it with determinants positively influencing 
acceptance [51]. To this end, the following barriers have 
been identified: interruption of traditional practice patterns, 
lack of evidence regarding the benefits of IT, organizational 
issues, as well as system-specific issues, such as reliability 
and dependency. An extended TAM model for health IT 
acceptance suggested information quality and enabling 
factors as second order constructs that affect perceived 
usefulness and perceived ease of use [52]. In the proposed 
model, information quality is posited to be determined by 
accuracy, content, format and timeliness, while computing 
support and self-efficacy constitute enabling factors. The 
results of a study carried out to test the model highlight that 
the quality of the information provided by the system and the 
extent to which the user feels they have the technical support 
or skills to make use of the system are both significant. With 
a focus on attributes of the individual that have an impact on 
health IT acceptance, IT feature demands and IT knowledge 
have been proposed as additional TAM constructs, while the 
physician’s specialty has been studied as a moderator [53]. 
The individual’s technological attitude has also been 
explored with regard to technology acceptance in a study 
focusing on mobile electronic medical record adoption by 
nurses [54], emphasizing the importance of optimism on 
perceived usefulness and the impact of optimism, 
innovativeness, insecurity and discomfort on perceived ease 
of use. 
H. Assistive Technology and Ubiquitous Computing 
Assistive Technology (AT) and robotics is another 
technological advancement that has led to further exploration 
of technology acceptance. The Almere model, an extension 
of the UTAUT model [55], considers the effect of perceived 
enjoyment, social presence, perceived sociability, trust, and 
perceived adaptivity. Perceived adaptivity refers to the 
capability of the system to change over time in order to 
support the changing conditions and needs of its users. 
Testing the model identified among others that perceived 
adaptivity directly affects user attitude and perceived 
42

usefulness, perceived sociability affects perceived enjoyment 
and social presence, while intention to use is directly 
influenced 
by 
social 
influences, 
attitude, 
perceived 
usefulness and ease of use, as well as perceived enjoyment. 
The Ubiquitous Computing Acceptance Model [56] has 
been proposed to predict whether potential users will accept 
Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp), by studying the 
relationships among trust, security, privacy, usefulness, ease 
of use and intention to use a ubiquitous computing 
technology. In the UbiComp domain, the Pervasive 
Technology Acceptance Model (PTAM) [57] has extended 
TAM by adding the constructs of trust and integration as 
direct determinants of behavioral intention, while it adds 
usage motivation, socioeconomic status, age, gender, and 
expertise as moderators. Trust is examined in terms of 
keeping the information collected about the individual as 
confidential and in terms of trusting the application to 
behave as expected, given its potential to tailor its behavior. 
Integration refers to how well the technology is integrated 
into the individual’s life (e.g., by not distracting them or 
interfering with their other activities). 
IV. 
TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE AND AMBIENT 
INTELLIGENCE 
In summary, research in the direction of technology 
acceptance has led to the aggregation of a considerable 
number of parameters that can be considered as important 
towards predicting the acceptance of a given technology by 
its target audience. It should be noted that the literature 
review that has been carried out was not exhaustive, as there 
are more studies for the aforementioned domains and also 
there are studies on technology acceptance for other domains 
that have not been included in this paper. Literature abounds 
with studies of users’ acceptance in wide a variety of 
domains, such as e-logistics [58], online tax system [59], 
hotel office front systems [60], Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) systems [61], electronic mediated commerce using 
interactive television [62], Radio-frequency Identification 
(RFID) technology [63], Internet of Things [64], etc.  
Instead, the purpose of the current review was to 
emphasize the plethora of parameters that should be taken 
into account, especially in the context of AmI environments, 
due to their technological complexity and diversity in context 
of use. As a result, the review has included studies mostly 
relevant to AmI and studies of major everyday life domains, 
with a focus on those that have introduced new constructs in 
acceptance models. Indeed, the presented review and 
classification has resulted in 73 parameters of technology 
acceptance that act as direct determinants, antecedents or 
moderators of technology acceptance. Also, it is noteworthy 
that the overwhelming majority of these parameters 
(98.92%) is assessed in the various studies through 
questionnaires, 
asking 
users 
to 
self-report 
their 
characteristics, attitudes and perceptions. 
An important concern is how to practically employ these 
models in the context of the assessment of Ambient 
Intelligence technologies. To this end, a classification of the 
aforementioned parameters is required. Attributes that can be 
used for this classification include: 
 
Category of reference: if the metric is used to 
describe an attribute of the individual, of the social 
environment or the system under evaluation 
 
Assessment 
method: 
which 
method 
will 
be 
employed to find out the value of the specific metric 
(e.g., questionnaire, observation, automated system 
measurement) 
 
The context in which the specific metric can be 
applied (e.g., workplace, education, health, home 
environment, public environments) 
Based on this suggestion, the tables below list all the 
metrics identified in literature, as follows: Table I lists all 
system-related parameters,  
Table II encompasses attributes describing social 
influences, as well as environment factors, while  
Table III features parameters describing system impact 
on the individual, and  
 
Table IV refers to parameters concerning the individual 
(user). Each table includes four columns: (i) the parameter 
evaluated, and its various synonyms met across literature, (ii) 
the assessment method, (iii) the context, and (iv) references 
to publications that include the specific parameter in the 
proposed models. In summary, as shown in Figure 1, more 
than half of the parameters refer to system attributes.

CONCLUSION 
Technology acceptance, in terms of prediction and 
estimation, has been in the focus of research since the 
seventies. Although technology and its context has largely 
evolved ever since from a typical computer in the workplace 
to 
hidden 
microcomputers 
in 
everyday 
appliances, 
technology acceptance remains important and an active 
research topic. In the light of the new advancements 
expected in AmI environments, which address a broad range 
of technologies, users, and contexts, this paper has reviewed 
technology acceptance models as they have evolved to 
address a wide range of technologies and contexts of use. 
Furthermore, a classification has been carried out of the 
factors that have been found to directly or indirectly impact 
technology acceptance, organizing them in system-related,

individual-related, social and environmental influence, as 
well as system impact factors. The literature review and the 
classification have highlighted that all factors have been 
assessed in previous approaches through questionnaires, as 
self-reported metrics. 
Although the self-reporting approach is inevitable in 
many cases, and the only possible method when the first 
studies were carried out, this is no longer an ideal solution in 
the context of AmI environments. On the one hand, the 
number of questions to be asked to the user may become 
unmanageable in such environments, if all the relevant 
aspects are to be assessed. On the other hand, an AmI 
environment has the capability to provide measurements 
through its sensors that will constrain the number of 
questions that need to be asked to the user. The vision of 
AmI can bring about new perspectives to technology 
acceptance and evaluation, facilitating not only the 
environment in adapting itself to better serve the needs of the 
user, but also evaluators aiming to assess the overall user 
acceptance of such environments. This potential highlights 
the need for a user acceptance evaluation model in AmI 
environments, 
aiming 
to 
assess 
a 
wide range of 
characteristics and qualities of such environments, taking 
into account traditional and modern models and evaluation 
approaches.
