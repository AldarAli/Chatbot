Abstract—Wideband 
filters 
employing 
Operational 
Amplifiers (OP Amps) are required in sensing devices such as 
video cameras for environment sensing. A high-speed low-
voltage Folded-Cascode (FC) OP Amp with a Dynamic 
Switching Bias (DSB) circuit capable of processing video signals, 
which enables low power consumption, high gain with wide 
bandwidths, and a wide dynamic range, was proposed. Through 
simulations, it was shown that the OP Amp with the reduced 3-
V power supply is able to operate at a 14.3 MHz dynamic 
switching rate, allowing processing video signals, and a 
dissipated power of 57 % compared to that in the conventional 
5-V power DSBFC OP Amp while keeping a 0.6 V wide output 
dynamic range. The response of the 2nd-order switched 
capacitor Low-Pass Filter (LPF) tested as its application was 
near the theoretical frequency response within frequencies 
below 5 MHz. The power dissipation of this LPF was also 
reduced to 56.8 % of that in the switched capacitor LPF with 
the conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Wideband filters are essential for signal processing in 
video electronic appliances. Specifically, a wideband Low-
Pass Filter (LPF) is needed in sensing devices such as a CCD 
(Charge-Coupled Device) camera with a monitor handling a 
wide bandwidth video signal of over 2 MHz. The CMOS 
(Complementary MOS) Switched Capacitor (SC) techniques 
suitable for realizing analog signal processing ICs 
(Integrated Circuits), have promising use in video signal 
bandwidth circuits. It has been demonstrated that SC 
techniques using CMOS Operational Amplifiers (OP Amps) 
are useful for implementing analog functions such as filters 
[1]-[4]. Although CMOS OP Amps are suitable for such 
filter ICs, the use of several OP Amps results in large power 
consumption. Especially, the power consumption of OP 
Amps in high speed operation becomes large because they 
have wideband properties. There is a possibility that this 
causes unstable operation.  
Until now, several approaches have been considered to 
decrease the power consumption of OP Amps, including the 
development of ICs that work at low power supply voltages 
[5][6]. In the two-stage Folded-Cascode (FC) OP Amp 
operating at the low power of 1 V [6], resistive biasing and 
capacitive level shifter are required to increase the output 
voltage swing. The requirement of four resistors for the 
resistive biasing makes it difficult to realize as an IC. A 
clocked current bias scheme for FC OP Amps suitable for 
achieving a wide dynamic range has typically been 
proposed to decrease the power consumption of the OP 
Amp [7][8]. Since the circuit requires complicated four-
phase bias-current control pulses and biasing circuits, it is 
not suitable for the high speed operation and results in a 
 large layout area. 
Recently, the author proposed an FC CMOS OP Amp 
with a Dynamic Switching Bias circuit (DSBFC OP Amp), 
of simple configuration, to provide low power consumption 
while maintaining high speed switching operation suitable 
for processing video signals [9]. This OP Amp operating at 
the 5-V power supply voltage is not necessarily enough for 
use in low-voltage signal processing applications under the 
progress of miniaturization of equipment. That is, the 
development of OP Amps with a still lower power supply 
voltage is expected to decrease their power dissipation. 
 In this paper, a Low-Voltage (LV) DSBFC OP Amp 
with the 3-V power supply voltage is proposed, which 
enables low power consumption and is suitable for achieving 
wide bandwidths and realizing as an IC. The point of view in 
design for architecture and operation of the LV DSBFC OP 
Amp is discussed in Section Ⅱ. Simulation results for 
performance of the LV DSBFC OP Amp are shown in 
Section Ⅲ. As an application example of this OP Amp, its 
practicability for a 2nd-order SC Butterworth LPF is also 
evaluated in Section Ⅳ.  Finally, conclusions of this work are 
summarized in Section Ⅴ.

LOW-VOLTAGE DSB OP AMP CONFIGURATION 
Figure 1 shows a configuration of an LV DSBFC OP 
Amp, in which the power supply voltages (±1.5 V) were 
reduced to 60 % of the previous ones (±2.5 V). The DSB 
method is also used for implementing low power 
consumption. When the power supply voltage is simply 
reduced, their gains are restrained and bandwidth becomes 
low. So, in the newly developed circuit, each FET (Field 
Effect Transistor) size of the LV DSBFC OP Amp was 
optimized to achieve high-speed switching operation of 14.3 
MHz. This OP Amp has a DSB circuit suitable for low 
power dissipation and an FC OP Amp to achieve a wide 
dynamic range even in low power supply voltages. The DSB

circuit consists of a bias circuit of M1-M4. The FC OP Amp 
consists of a current mirror of M10-M13 and current sources 
of M8, M9, M14, and M15. The current sources M5, M8, and 
M15 of the FC OP Amp are controlled by switching a bias 
voltage VB of the DSB circuit dynamically from VB* to -1.5 
V to reduce the power consumption still more. Table Ⅰ 
shows its designed values. A minimum channel length of p-
MOS FETs and n-MOS FETs is 2.5 μm. In order to achieve 
almost the same transconductance gm as that in the 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp, a channel width W 
of M11 and M12 and that of M10 and M13, in p-MOS current 
mirror circuits, were increased by nearly fourfold and 
twofold, respectively. Each W of n-MOS current sources M9, 
M14, M8, and M15 was increased by nearly one and a half. 
The bias voltage of VB* at the on state of the FC OP Amp 
was adjusted to nearly 0 V (larger than the conventional one) 
to decrease W of the current source M5 maintaining a high 
switching speed of the DSB circuit. W of M1-M3 was 
increased by over twofold. W of M4 was adjusted to an 
optimum value. The bias voltage Vb of the current source 
consisting of M9 and M14 was set at 0.15 V. 
In the DSB circuit, when an external control pulse φB 
driving an inverting switching circuit of M1-M4 is -1.5 V, 
the OP Amp turns on by setting VB at an appropriate level of 
nearly 0 V by enabling M3 and M4 to operate in the 
saturation region, and operates normally as an operational 
amplifier. Conversely, whenφB becomes 1.5 V, the OP Amp 
turns off by setting VB at nearly -1.5 V, enabling M1 to 
operate in a low impedance and M3 in a high impedance. 
This high impedance status of M3 occurs because the gate of 
M3 is set at a potential determined by the capacitive 
coupling between gate and source of M2 and between gate 
and drain of M3 at the transition of φB to 1.5 V. Therefore, 
the OP Amp does not dissipate power at all during this off

period, which brings about low power consumption. 
Ⅲ. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The LV DSBFC OP Amp performance was tested 
through SPICE simulations. The power supply voltages VDD 
and Vss are 1.5 V. Typical performances compared with 
those of the conventional DSBFC OP Amp with a power 
supply of 5 V are shown in Table Ⅱ. The values of 
parameters of open loop gain, phase margin, unity gain 
frequency, slew rate, and settling time are almost the same as 
those in the conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp. As 
the inherent static nonlinearity of the LV DSBFC OP Amp, 
the total harmonic distortion THD for the 10 kHz input 
signal, enabling 0.6 Vp-p to output, was 0.73 %, which is a 
little large compared to the conventional one. However, this 
is less than 1 %.  
The LV DSBFC OP Amp operated in a dynamic switching              
mode with a Duty Ratio (DR) of 50 % and a switching 
frequency, fs, of 14.3 MHz as shown in Figure 2. The output 
sine wave voltage for the input signal of 1 mV was nearly 
equal to that in the static operation mode of this OP Amp. 
Like this, the distortion by the dynamic operation seems to 
be hardly seen. In the dynamic switching operation mode of 
50 % duty ratio, the power dissipation was 9.3 mW, which is 
66 % of that observed in the static operation mode as shown 
in Figure 3. This is also 57 % of that of the conventional 5-V 
power DSBFC OP Amp. This shows this OP Amp’s 
extremely low power consumption characteristics due to the 
reduced effect of power supply voltages (60 % of that in the

conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp) and dynamic 
switching operation.  
The LV DSBFC OP Amp switches dynamically to the 
off state. At this time, though p-MOSFETs M11 and M12 
remain the on-state, MOSFETs M6, M7, M9, M10, M13, and 
M14 change to the on-state weakly. The output terminal of 
Vo of the OP Amp is set at a voltage depending on the load 
capacitance through the capacitive coupling between the 
drain and the gate of the MOSFET M13. So, a large output 
swing in Vo occurs at the off-state transition. A dynamic 
offset voltage Voff (defined as the difference of the on-state 
and the off-state output voltages) at the off-state transition of 
the OP Amp vs. load capacitance CL was tested (Figure 4). In 
small load capacitances less than 1.5 pF, top and bottom 
signal levels of the dynamic off swing do not match. This 
causes distortion at an output signal of the OP Amp. 
Therefore, we can see that the load capacitance CL over 2 pF 
is desirable for its operation. 
 
 
Ⅳ. APPLICATION TO SC LPF 
To demonstrate the practicability of the above low-
voltage DSBFC OP Amp, the feasibility of its application in 
a 2nd-order SC IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) LPF with the 
Butterworth frequency characteristic was tested. When a 
sampling frequency fs=14.3 MHz (equal to four times of 
NTSC (National Television System Committee) color sub-
carrier frequency 3.58 MHz) and a cutoff frequency fc=2 
MHz, respectively, were chosen for this LPF, the discrete-
time transfer function is given by [10] 
 
H(z) = −
0.1174(1+z−1)2
1−0.8252z−1+0.2946z−2 .                  (1) 
 
The circuit configuration and operation waveforms 
realizing this transfer function are shown in Figures 5 and 6, 
respectively [10]. This filter consists of a sample-hold circuit 
with a holding capacitor C1 and a CMOS sampling switch 
controlled by φSH, CMOS switches φ1, φ2 for charge 
transfer, capacitors A-E, G, and I, and two LV DSBFC OP 
Amps (OP Amps 1 and 2). The sampling switch was 
designed to a channel width / channel length W/L=105/2.5 
(μm/μm) for each of p-MOSFET and n-MOSFET. Other 
CMOS switches were designed to 75/2.5 (μm/μm). CMOS 
switches are turned on and off by non-overlapping two-phase 
clock pulsesφ1, φ2, swinging from -1.5 V to 1.5 V. These 
sampling and CMOS switches were designed to have a 
balanced structure with each equal L and W of p-MOS and 
n-MOS FETs to delete a feed-through phenomenon. This 
phenomenon is easy to be caused by a capacitive coupling 
between gate and output terminals.

Major CMOS process parameters are given as a gate 
insulating film thickness tox=50 nm, a p-MOSFET threshold

Operation waveforms for an input signal of 1 MHz with 
an amplitude of 0.3 V and an output load of 4 pF are shown 
in Figure 7. In the dynamic switching operation, an output 
load of the LV DSBFC OP Amp increases to nearly 5 pF 
including internal capacitances of the SC LPF. For the pass-
band frequency signal (≦2MHz), almost the same signal as 
the input one was obtained. The frequency response of the 
SC LPF in the dynamic switching operation of the LV 
DSBFC OP Amp is shown in Figure 8. The frequency 
response was near the theoretical one from 100 kHz to near 5 
MHz. In the high frequency range over 6 MHz, it 
deteriorated due to a sampling phase effect. The gain below -
26 dB was obtained at over 6 MHz within a stop-band. 
Though this stop-band gain is not enough, it is expected to be 
improved by making the roll-off steeper through the increase 
of filter order. 
Power dissipation vs. OP Amp switching duty ratio in the 
2nd-order SC LPF is shown in Figure 9. The power 
dissipation of the SC LPF itself decreased in proportion to 
the off period TB of the OP Amp. In the dynamic switching 
operation mode of TB=35 ns (DR=50 %), the power 
dissipation of the SC LPF (18.7 mW) was reduced to 66.8 % 
as compared to that in the static operation of the OP Amps 
(28.0 mW). Thus, the dynamic switching operation of the 
LV DSBFC OP Amp is useful for reducing the power 
dissipation of the SC LPF. This power dissipation was 
56.8 % compared to that in the SC LPF using the 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp (32.9 mW). This 
low power characteristic was realized by the low power 
supply voltages and dynamic switching operation.   
Ⅴ.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
A high-speed low-voltage Folded-Cascode (FC) OP Amp 
with a Dynamic Switching Bias (DSB) circuit capable of 
processing video signals, which enables low power 
consumption, high gain with wide bandwidths, and a wide 
dynamic range, was proposed. Through simulations, it was 
shown that the OP Amp with the reduced 3-V power supply 
is able to operate at a 14.3 MHz dynamic switching rate, 
allowing processing video signals, and a dissipated power of 
57 % compared to that in the conventional 5-V power 
DSBFC OP Amp while keeping a 0.6 V wide output 
dynamic range. The response of the 2nd-order Switched 
Capacitor Low-Pass Filter (SC LPF) tested as its application 
was near the theoretical frequency response within 
frequencies below 5 MHz. The power dissipation of this LPF 
was also reduced to 56.8 % of that in the SC LPF with the 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp. 
Thus, it was confirmed that the 3-V power DSBFC OP 
Amp is useful for high speed operation, low power 
consumption, and greatly reducing the power dissipation of 
the SC LPF. This circuit should be useful for the realization 
of low-power wide-band signal processing ICs. It is also 
noteworthy that the performance is expected to be improved 
still more by employing MOSFETs with a minimum shorter 
channel length than 2.5 μm used in this work.  
As the future work, the study on the increase of the filter 
order remains, because the frequency response will be 
improved to a practical level by increasing this one. However, 
there might be a limitation in the filter order, because two OP 
Amps per one order LPF must be used and so power 
dissipation will increase in proportion to the filter order.
