Abstract—Financial trading often combines machine learning 
and technical indicators to accurately predict future market 
prices. Energy data and financial data have similar features; 
therefore, this research derives eight electricity price technical 
indicators to help control spending and reduce trading costs for 
the Integrated Single Electricity Market in Ireland. The proposed 
technical indicators were derived from electricity price data, 
collected on an hourly basis from February until November 2019, 
and used to train three regression machine learning algorithms 
(Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient 
Boosting). The results for each of the regression algorithms were 
first compared using one model for all trading periods. The 
Random Forest algorithm was then trained with the same 
technical indicators for each of the 24 hours periods individually 
to see if an hourly approach enhanced model performance. The 
proposed technical indicators accurately predict electricity prices 
and overall accuracy was greatly improved using separate hourly 
forecasting models.

Indicators; Energy Market. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Energy data display volatile characteristics that make 
forecasting in the energy market difficult [1]. Time series 
models analyse patterns by observing and training with previous 
prices to predict future values. Price prediction machine learning 
algorithms are an increasingly popular tool to tackle volatility 
and reduce trading costs by creating optimal price models [2]. 
Price fluctuations arise when supply and demand are 
imbalanced, but price forecasting can optimise unit purchasing 
especially when short-term forecasting as the relationship is 
stronger between actual and predicted values [3]. This research 
centres on day-ahead electricity price prediction to examine 
energy market trends, with the overall aim of building an 
innovative system that assists electricity suppliers in future 
planning to reduce purchasing costs and hence enables 
consistent pricing for customers. 
In the financial trading market, simple machine learning 
algorithms have been quite effective when used for prediction 
[4]. Technical indicators originate from historical financial data 
and are often used as inputs to train machine learning forecasting 
models. Generally, technical indicators are mostly considered to 
aid investors in whether it is best to buy or sell in the trading 
market [5]. This approach could be applied to the day-ahead 
energy market by developing specific technical indicators that 
follow electricity price trends and including these derived 
indicators as inputs in prediction models to forecast future 
electricity prices. Technical indicators have only recently been 
applied in the energy market for day-ahead forecasting, 
therefore existing literature in this area is limited [6]. Energy 
forecasting models that apply fundamental indicators as inputs 
(load, weather variables, generation, etc.) have found that same 
hour input data have robust correlation [7]. This conclusion was 
also stated when separate 24-hour time-series models were 
applied to the Spanish electricity price market data, noting that 
separate hour models were more homogeneous in observing 
trends than a model that considers all hours [8].   
This paper develops eight new technical indicators 
specifically for the energy market, building on the idea from [6] 
of calculating the indicators for each hour separately. First, we 
examine our technical indicators by including them as inputs and 
using the actual electricity price as output in machine learning 
regression models. The forecasting performance for day-ahead 
predictions is evaluated for all techniques and all 24-hours are 
included in the training models. The model performance 
accuracies are then compared with the performance of models 
that are trained only on raw price data as input, denoted as 
persistence models, to determine if including technical 
indicators as inputs improves model performance. This research 
then examines 1-hourly models for each of the 24 hours to 
determine if technical indicators do follow hourly patterns and 
are therefore better at matching market trends when split by 
hour.   
This paper is organised as follows: Section II outlines each 
of the proposed technical indicators for energy market 
prediction and describes how each is calculated in terms of 
electricity price. Section III discusses the three regression 
algorithm modelling techniques. The results are presented and 
discussed in Section IV highlighting first, the accuracy of each 
regression 24-hour model, and then displaying the results for 
each of the individual 24 1-hour Random Forest models. Section 
V concludes the paper by summarising the key findings of this 
research. 
II. TECHNICAL INDICATORS 
Technical analysis is common in stock market trading to 
capture trends and information on price movement from 
indicators built using raw stock price [9]. The core indicators for 
price prediction are: (i) trend, (ii) oscillator, and (iii) momentum 
[5]. The most complex part of technical analysis is deciding on

parameter optimization and the sliding window size is a key 
feature as it relates to the corresponding number of historical 
records required for the calculation of each indicator [10]. A new 
advancement for the island of Ireland is the Integrated Single 
Electricity Market (ISEM) allowing energy traders greater 
control. This development has led to the need for novel technical 
price indicators to aid in forecasting decisions when to buy or 
sell in the ISEM. 
Our research presents eight innovative energy trading 
technical indicators originating from, but not the same as, the 
common financial technical indicators. The requirement for the 
ISEM is day-ahead, therefore this work only focusses on 
technical price indicators which improve day-ahead prediction 
accuracy. The individual calculations for each of the indicators 
used in both the all hours model and separate hourly models are 
listed below: 
1. Percentage Price Change Moving Average (PPCMA): 
A trend indicator in time-series that, for the energy 
market, we calculate price change as the difference 
between the current price (𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑛) and the price 
from the same time period the day before (𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐿𝑎𝑔 24), 
all divided by 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐿𝑎𝑔 24. In the all hours model, the 
moving average percentage price change was calculated 
for is a rolling 24-hour window (i=24). For the hourly 
models, a pool (i) ranging from a rolling 1-hour window 
(i=1) to a 100-hour window (i=100) was calculated:     
𝑃𝑃𝐶𝑀𝐴𝑖 = ∑[𝑃𝑃𝐶]
𝑖
 
 
() 
where 
 
𝑃𝑃𝐶 = 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 − 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐿𝑎𝑔 24
𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐿𝑎𝑔 24
∗ 100 
() 
2. Moving Average Deviation (MAD): A trend indicator 
that utilises the PPCMA indicator to calculate the 
deviation rate of the current electricity price from 
PPCMA. For the hourly models, a pool (i) ranges from 
1 to 100:  
𝑀𝐴𝐷𝑖 = 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 −  𝑃𝑃𝐶𝑀𝐴𝑖
𝑃𝑃𝐶𝑀𝐴𝑖
 
() 
3. Percentage Range (PR): An oscillator indicator that 
finds a relationship between current electricity price and 
the highest/lowest prices over a 24-hour window for the 
all hours model. For the hourly models, a pool (i) ranges 
from 1 to 100 to calculate the highest and lowest prices. 
This indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with a value 
above 80 determined to indicate energy units are 
oversold and a value below 20 indicating that energy 
units are overbought:  
𝑃𝑅𝑖 = [ 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 − 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 
𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 − 𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 
] ∗ 100 
(4) 
4. Average True Range (ATR): A trend indicator 
measuring price volatility. Over a 24-hour window, 
there are three different values calculated for the all 
hours model: highest price over the 24-hour period 
minus lowest price over the 24-hour period; highest 
price over the 24-hour period minus starting electricity 
price; and lowest price over the 24-hour period minus 
starting electricity price. The maximum value from 
these three values is selected for each trading hour and 
averaged over a rolling 24-hour window. For the hourly 
models, a pool (i) ranging from a rolling 1-hour window 
to a 100-hour window were used in the calculations:    
𝐴𝑇𝑅𝑖 = ∑𝑀𝐴𝑋 [ 𝐴𝑖, 𝐵𝑖, 𝐶𝑖 ]
𝑖
 
(5) 
   𝐴𝑖 =  𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 − 𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖  
(6) 
      𝐵𝑖 = | 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 − 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 | 
() 
    𝐶𝑖 = | 𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑖 − 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 | 
() 
 
5. 
Relative Strength Index (RSI): An oscillator indicator 
that compares recent price gains to recent price losses. 
This indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with a value 
over 70 determined to indicate that energy units are 
overvalued and a value below 30 indicating that energy 
units are undervalued. For the all hours model, Price Up 
is the average of the previous 24 hours when price 
difference increased, and Price Down is the average of 
the previous 24 hours when price difference decreased. 
For the hourly models, Price Up and Price Down are 
calculated from the average of the previous i hours with 
i ranging from 0 to 100:    
𝑅𝑆𝐼𝑖 = 100 − [100

∑ 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝐷𝑜𝑤𝑛[𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  − 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐿𝑎𝑔 𝑖]
𝑖
)       (10) 
 
6. Average Directional Movement Index (ADX): A trend 
indicator measuring the strength of the trend, grouping 
the two directional movement indexes depending 
whether price change, calculated as current electricity 
price minus previous 24-hour price (all hours 
model)/previous i-hour price (hourly models), is 
grouped as a Price Up (positive) change or Price Down 
(negative) change. The two indexes are combined and 
smoothed with a moving average:  
𝐴𝐷𝑋𝑖 = [∑ 𝐷𝑋 𝑈𝑝(𝑎𝑖)

7. Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD): 
An oscillator indicator that considers the strength, 
direction, and duration of the trend as well as price 
momentum through moving averages of previous price 
values with rolling window sizes of 12 and 24 for the all 
hours model and rolling window sizes of 7 and 14 for 
the hourly models:

(14) 
 
8. Price Momentum (PMOM): A momentum indicator 
that measures the power of the market by observing the 
current electricity price with the previous trading value 
(1 hour before) for the all hours model. For the hourly 
models, a pool (i) ranges from 1 to 100 to calculate:   
𝑃𝑀𝑂𝑀𝑖 = 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 − 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐿𝑎𝑔 𝑖 
 
(15) 
 
III. MODELLING METHODOLOGY 
Three machine learning algorithms were trained with the 
eight technical indicators, implemented through SkLearn. A 
Random Forest regression algorithm is an efficient ensemble 
technique with many benefits: straightforward tuning, robust to 
outliers, and expandable for data fitting [11]. During training of 
a Random Forest, there are multiple trees split at nodes therefore 
no single tree perceives the complete training dataset [12]. There 
is transparency with the algorithm as a tuning parameter decides 
when to split the input data for classifying [13]. After the 
Random Forest is built a prediction value is outputted, which is 
the average of each individual regression tree’s prediction [14]. 
In this research, a Random Forest regression algorithm was 
implemented with 1000 trees and no pruning. Criterion measure 
of split was set to Mean Squared Error (MSE) with minimum 
sample split set to 2 and minimum sample leaf node set to 1.   
Sequential learning, used in boosting algorithms, combines 
weak learner models to create one strong learner model [15]. In 
a Gradient Boosting regression algorithm, a prediction model is 
built from weak learners through optimizing a loss function [16]. 
Another boosting regression algorithm is the Extreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost) that works through ensemble sequential 
learning with weighted predictors [16]. This is an advanced 
machine learning algorithm due to speed and the ability to train 
large data [17]. In this research, an XGBoost algorithm was 
implemented with 1000 trees, the fraction of column to be a 
random tree sample was set to 0.6, the fraction of observations 
to be random tree subsample was set to 0.8, the maximum depth 
of tree was set to 4, with a learning rate of 0.05. 
The hourly models contain different technical indicator 
parameters depending on the hour (0-23). As a pool of indicators 
ranging from 1 to 100 were created for this part of the research, 
selecting the optimal indicators for each hour is the first step. 
Hyperparameters n and s represent the lag factor and span 
respectively. This approach of finding an optimal n and s was 
taken from the work presented in [6]. In our research, n was 
utilized in the creation of five of our novel technical indicators 
(PR, ATR, RSI, ADX, and PMOM) and s was utilized in the 
creation of two of our novel technical indicators (PPCMA and 
MAD). To find the optimal n and s for each hour, the model 
which provided the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 
during the Random Forest algorithm testing set was selected. 
This is calculated in terms of electricity price as the difference 
between actual and predicted price values. Optimization was 
implemented on SkLearn by creating a list with all possible 
combinations for n and s and ranking the RMSE for each 
combination in order from lowest to highest RMSE.

 Table I displays the optimal n and s values for each of the 
24 1-hour models. During the selection, the Random Forest 
algorithm was applied and the corresponding technical 
indicators were chosen based on optimal n and s. For instance, 
the optimal technical indicators for Hour 0 are PPCMA45, 
MAD45, PR48, ATR48, RSI48, ADX48, MACD, and 
PMOM48. If n or s reached the maximum value of 100 the 
indicator pool range was increased to 150 to ensure the optimal 
model was selected.   
IV. RESULTS 
 For the experiments, we use hourly ISEM electricity price 
data ranging from 1st February 2019 until 01st December 2019 
retrieved from SEMOpx website [18]. The technical indicators 
derived from the raw price data, outlined in Section II, were first 
calculated using all data and a sliding window of 24 hours. 
Additionally, the indicators were calculated for each hour 
separately and this time a sliding window pool i from 1 to 100 
was utilised for each indicator to find the optimal n and s. The 
calculated technical indicators were applied as training inputs 
for the three machine learning models. 
The data for the 24-hour machine learning models were split 
85% for training (04th February - 16 October 2019) and 15% for 
testing (17th October – 30th November 2019). The input data 
were the eight technical indicators and the output data was the 
actual electricity price for the same timeframe, time T. To put 
this research work into context, a persistence model with raw 
electricity price data as input was observed as a baseline at time 
T and output price data at time T+24. Table II presents 
comparative results for both persistence and technical indicator 
24-hour models for Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and 
XGBoost. The most predictive indicators were MAD and

Figure. 1. Random Forest 24-Hour Model Testing 
 Testing model accuracy percentage is computed as model 
error, chosen as the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), 
subtracted from 100. The RMSLE metric was chosen for the 
accuracy calculation as it is robust to outliers, only observes 
relative error, and gives a larger penalty for underestimating 
[19]. From Table I, the testing accuracy ranged between 73% 
and 76% for the persistence models and ranged between 86% 
and 92% for the technical indicator models highlighting that 
using technical indicators as inputs improves model 
performance. RMSE evaluates the model performance of the 
test set, the closer the value is to zero the better the prediction. 
During model testing, XGBoost provided the lowest RMSE 
value of 5.34. However, the model accuracy was the highest at 
91.57% using the Random Forest. Figure 1 illustrates the actual 
electricity price values plotted against the predicted price values 
for the Random Forest testing phase. The figure exhibits a good-
fit for the majority of predicted values especially at the 
beginning of the testing period, but the fit is less accurate during 
the last few hours of the testing period.

   The next stage of this work was to split the data by hour 
before calculating separate hourly technical indicators to 
determine if models are better trained as 24 separate 1-hour 
prediction models. As well as hourly technical indicators, there 
was also a pool of indicators with varying n and s for each hour 
in order to select the optimal hourly models. The technical 
indicators were calculated from data ranging between February 
and December 2019 and used as model inputs. From the 
previous work, it was clear that no matter which machine 
learning algorithm was used, the use of technical indicators      
improved prediction performance. Therefore, we only create 
hourly models using the Random Forest algorithm as it 
presented the highest model accuracy in Table II. The Random 
Forest hourly models used 85% of the dataset for training (11th 
May - 31 October 2019) and 15% for testing (01st November – 
01st December 2019). Each Random Forest hourly model had 
the technical indicators as input at time T and output price data 
at time T+1 (day-ahead). 
Figure. 2. Random Forest Hour 8 Model Testing 
 
Table III presents the optimal model testing accuracy and 
RMSE values for each hour separately. Overall, the testing 
accuracy ranged from 84% to over 99% and most of the testing 
RMSE values were below 3. This is a significant improvement 
from the testing results shown in Table II. Hour 8 had the most 
promising results with a testing accuracy of 99.32% and a 
RMSE value of 0.74. The visual output of the actual and 
predicted electricity prices for this hour are displayed in Figure 
2 illustrating an excellent fit. As this plot is for a 1-hour model 
(Hour 8) the x-axis (Figure 2) is the same hour in each day in the 
testing period, whereas in the all hours technical indicator model 
the x-axis (Figure 1) is every hour in the testing period.  
V. CONCLUSION 
Eight technical indicators (PPCMA, MAD, PR, ATR, RSI, 
ADX, MACD, and Price Momentum) were specifically derived 
from raw data for energy trading and tested on three machine 
learning regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, 
and XGBoost) to forecast electricity prices. The technical 
indicators were first calculated using an all hours approach and 
then they were re-calculated when split by hour to find an 
optimal hourly electricity price forecasting model. 
In both approaches, the model data were split 85% for 
training and 15% for testing. In the 24-hour model approach, the 
results were compared with a baseline persistence model which 
was tested with raw price data only. The three algorithms 
accuracy ranged between 73% and 76% for the persistence 
models and ranged between 86% and 92% for the technical 
indicator models. These results confirmed that including 
technical indicators as model inputs improved overall 
performance. 
In the next experiment stage, 24 separate 1-hour prediction 
models were generated using the Random Forest algorithm. 
Random Forest was selected here as in previous results it 
resulted in the highest model accuracy. Optimal n and s were 
required for each of the 24 1-hour Random Forest models split 
by hour and chosen through running each indicator pool 
combination and selecting the hyperparameters which result in 
the lowest RMSE. The testing accuracy ranged between 84% to 
over 99% for each of the 24 1-hour models and the majority had 
a RMSE value below 3. These promising results indicate that 
having individual hour models are more homogeneous and 
beneficial for energy trading. 
To conclude, energy traders should consider technical 
indicators in price prediction models, especially individual 
models that have been optimised for each hour of the day, to 
capture market trends and enable accurate predictions, thus 
reducing purchasing costs. Further work will consider adding 
other energy related factors, such as wind generation to the 
optimal models to determine if model accuracy can be further 
improved.
