Abstract—This paper presents a context-aware healthcare dataset
that has been designed to understand and monitor the health-
shocks in Pakistan. Based on the socio-economic, cultural, and
geographic norms, a user study based on questionnaire compris-
ing of 47 features was carried out. In total, 1, 000 households
belonging to 29 villages in rural areas participated in this
user study. The purpose of this research is to monitor health-
shocks in a community using data visualization and predictive
modelling. We envisage that this study will provide insight
into the relationships between socio-economic, demographic, and
geographical conditions impacting health issues.
Keywords–Context-aware; socio-economic; cultural; geograph-
ical; data visualization; and predictive modelling.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Generally, healthcare systems are evaluated based on three
main factors: quality, cost, and accessibility to health-care,
known as “The Iron Triangle of Health-Care” as shown in
Fig. 1. In case of an effective health-care system, there should

be a balance between all the three components, i.e., the iron
triangle should be an equilateral triangle, with each angle of
60◦ [1]. However, in practice, any effective health-care system
can only optimize two of the three factors. For instance, to
achieve higher access and quality, its associated cost will
increase [2]. Furthermore, these factors highly depend on the
socio-economic, geographic, and cultural norms. Especially,
in order to understand the health-shocks situation of any third
world country, there is a need to understand socio-economic,
geographic, and cultural norms of that origin. By health-
shocks, we mean critical illness of families, principle bread
winner and its socio-economic after-effects on individual,
family, society and various governance levels [3].
In this regard, a lot of research work has been done to
understand the reasons and effects of health shocks in the
developed and developing countries [4]–[9]. In [7], different
socio-economic factors and their impacts were studied. It was
reported in [7] that 63.8% of health expenditure was out-
of-pocket, i.e., from the pocket of patient, which resulted in
ﬁnancial losses. In [10], health related “hardship ﬁnancing” for
poor households in an Indian town Orissa was studied. The
authors investigated factors inﬂuencing the risk of hardship
ﬁnancing with the use of a logistic regression. It was observed
that in rural areas, most of the households were facing ﬁnancial
hardships due to indirect and/or long-term costs of health-care.
In Orissa, 80% of spending on health-care was out-of-pocket of
the households for which they either borrow money at higher
interest or sell their assets.
From the various studies [10]–[12], it is quite evident that
the unpredictable timing of health issues and immediate need
for large funds for health-care in addition to the distance to
health facilities could increase the risk of hardship ﬁnancing.
In this paper, we have tried to understand the health-care
system of Pakistan and how the socio-economic, geographical
and cultural norms are affecting the health of almost 200
million Pakistanis, especially those who belong to rural and
tribal areas. For instance, women in rural and tribal areas of
Pakistan are not allowed by their men to consult a male doctor
during pregnancy which results in higher infant mortality rates
(IMR) and maternal mortality rates (MMR). In Pakistan, IMR
which is a count of the number of infants that die before their
ﬁrst birthday in every thousand infants was 80 at the start of
this century. Table I shows the IMR of Pakistan in comparison
to other countries. Currently, there are only 25 countries that
have a higher IMR than Pakistan.
Another useful measure for assessing children’s health is
their weight. Experts have ﬁgured out a scale that lists out the
appropriate weight for healthy children at any given age. In
2001, percentage of underweight children who were less than
ﬁve years old was 32% in Pakistan. During the millennium
development goals, government of Pakistan has vowed to
reduce it to 20%, by 2015. In developed countries, such as
Japan, this percentage is less than one.
Similarly, MMR which is considered as a basic measure
for assessing the health of the mothers in any given region was
490 in Pakistan during 1990. Another important factor that is
directly related to IMR and MMR is “appropriate pregnancy

spacing”. Generally, it is recommended to maintain a 2.5 to 3
years gap between pregnancies which is vital for the health of
both mother and child. However, such spacing is only possible
with proper awareness, equipment and its availability, and
birth control. According to [14], around 27% of the Pakistani
couples who preferred to use some sort of birth control did
not ﬁnd it available in their local region.
II.
ANATOMY OF DATASET
To understand the health shocks and its causes, we col-
lected a dataset of 1, 000 households from the district Haripur
with the help of Begum Mahmuda Welfare Trust hospital
(BMWT). Haripur district is in the Hazara region of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It is located in a hilly plain
area at an altitude of around 610 meters above sea level with
an estimated population of a million in 2009 [13]. In district of
Haripur, there are about 39 hospitals and basic health centers,
and 10 dispensaries. Furthermore, there is only one bed for
every 1, 516 people [13]. In contrast to Haripur, there is one
bed for every 100 people in the developed countries of the
world. Moreover, in district of Haripur, IMR is 66 whereas
overall MMR in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is 275.
Based on “patients to bed ratio”, Pakistan is ranked at
178 out of 194, internationally. Furthermore, in comparison
to developed countries where there is at least one doctor for
every 712 people, Pakistan has only one certiﬁed doctor for
every 1, 230 people.
A. Survey Features
In order to ﬁnd the ground realities of health-care facilities
in rural areas, we have collected the information about age,
marital status, sex of the household head, their involvement
in the labour force, education of children, ﬁnancial and water
resources, access to health facilities, schools and clean water,
effects of climatic changes, effects of shortage of basic facili-
ties like fuel, food, money for treatment of illness or fertilizer
for crops, and waste disposal trends.
B. Ethical Considerations
Based on the cultural norms of this region, ﬁve ethical
concerns were short-listed that we wanted to conﬁrm while
conducting the study. These six ethical concerns includes:
voluntary participation, no harm to respondents, anonymity and
conﬁdentiality, identifying purpose, sponsor, analysis and re-
porting. Throughout the survey, these guidelines were followed
strictly.
C. Survey Questionnaire
A printed questionnaire was used to obtain the survey
information from the responders directly. Here, we preferred
questionnaire over the interviews as questionnaires are more
systematic, less prone to personal biases and transcription
errors. Moreover, it offers more comfort to the responders as
they can ﬁll it in their own private settings with discretion.
In our study, questionnaires were in national language of
Pakistan, i.e., Urdu, in order to enable the villagers who does
not understand English to be able to answer the questions.
Furthermore, assistance was also provided to the participants
who could not read or write. The questionnaire was divided
into two sections, i.e., section A and section B.
Section A aimed at gaining demographic data such as age,
level of education, income and gender whereas Section B is
more concentrated on the living standard of the participants
and effects of health shocks on their families. Furthermore, as
the targeted population was too large to survey, so acciden-
tal sampling was used in identifying the participants. Here,
”self-report” was used a responding mechanism where people
voluntarily choose to respond to series of questions posed by
investigators and are allowed to skip as many questions as they
like.
D. Quality Assurance Measures
Different quality measures were also adopted from respon-
der’s perspective, i.e., understandability, comprehensiveness,
and acceptability of the survey forms. We have used quite a
few methods for quality assurance, including sample testing
by asking few expert interviewers and responders to ﬁll out
the survey form and incorporating their suggestions, cogni-
tive testing, by interviewing the responders to visualize the
questions and reiterate them in their own words, behavioural
testing by altering the questions and measuring the differ-
ence in responder’s answers to ﬁnd out how the wording in
questionnaire will affect the overall answer of the responders,
special probing, by explaining the intent of the questions to
the responders in local language, so the responders would not
take an inﬁnite amount of time to answer the questions, experts
opinion, by sharing the questionnaire with experts for their
valuable feedback and suggestions, compare and contrast, by
measuring the questionnaire against pre-existing surveys and
their responses in order to see what value additions can be
made, what best practices can be used, and what errors can be
avoided.
E. Pilot Study
In the pilot study, a multidimensional survey questionnaire
was distributed among 300 families living in the proximity
of Haripur district. During the survey, geo-coordinates of 29
villages of district Haripur which participated in the survey
were also noted as shown in Fig. 2. One of the primary objec-
tives of the pilot study was to reﬁne the survey questionnaire
based on its feedback. During the pilot study, some families
came to the hospital and/or local clinics to ﬁll the questionnaire
while others were contacted at their homes. The questionnaire
was given to the household heads who were older than 21
years with one or more family members living with them, who
were mentally stable, and were willing to participate in the
survey. Furthermore, there was no race, religion, and gender
discrimination during the survey activity.

During this pilot study, we also convinced the village elders
to actively participate in the survey and to provide us a good
insight about available health facilities in their villages. With
the active participation of the village elders, we met number of
families and explained them the purpose of this survey and the
changes that it can bring in their daily lives. As a result, 300
households participated in the pilot study. We also made sure
to maintain the conﬁdentiality and integrity of the households
by masking their names in the dataset.
As a result of the pilot study, we have found numerous
information that have helped us to reﬁne the survey, for
example, most of the subjects have a hard time getting clean
water or do not have a proper toilet facility. Almost all
participants are single with at least two adults living with them.
Students from participating families have to travel for at least
20 minutes to get to school. Minor illnesses occurred at least
twice a year while major diseases occurred 3-5 times a year in
most of the households. Most families fall short of money if
anyone in the family falls ill or has an injury. Stone and mortar
is mostly used as the basic construction material of external
walls while ceilings are mostly made of thick wood. People
mostly don’t have any toilet facility at home. Waste food, water
and garbage are mostly disposed off near homes. Almost every
time during the year people have to rely on an irrigation canal
for water source. Participants rely mostly on land and use it
for agriculture or livestock. Most common hardships faced are
loss of job or losing a house.
Furthermore, based on the feedback, we added some other
information in the survey that affects the overall health-care
system in Pakistan, namely: distance to the health units,
number of basic health units, costs associated with travelling,
accessible routes to the health facilities, vaccination, trans-
portation, sewerage system, awareness, and water resources,
just to name a few. Fig. 3 shows the modiﬁed iron triangle
that ﬁts well to the socio-economic, geographic and cultural
norms of our region.

F. Data Collection
At the end of the pilot study, all the changes were incor-
porated in the questionnaire. During the survey, we followed
a structured approach in which all the responders were given
the same possible choices and all questions were presented
to the responders in the same order, i.e., instructions and
79

explanations were ﬁxed. The questionnaire was ﬁlled by 1, 000
households. The head of the household was given a brief
account of the research and its importance and the support
of the administrator. Finally, we provided a telephone number
to the village elder for anyone with questions or who may
need assistance in completing the questionnaire at home. All
participants were provided a comfortable environment and
privacy. The questions were in easy to understand language. In
case of unanswered questions, questionnaire was brought back
to the participants to know the reason for not answering the
questions. The reason was then noted on the questionnaire next
to that question. In total, BMWT dataset comprises of 1, 000
households and for each household there are 47 features that
plays a vital role in the health-care system of Pakistan. Table II
shows the feature set of BMWT dataset.

DATA VISUALIZATION
Data visualization has been done using the purpose built
“HexChange” tool that was developed in C# (We are working
on its web-version which will be made publicly available). In
BMWT dataset, 47 features of 1, 000 households belonging
to 29 villages of Haripur district were captured as shown in
Fig. 4. Here, for the open-ended questions, we opted for the
quantitative content analysis which is a formal, systematic, and
objective process used in describing and testing the relationship
and their causal interactive effects among variables.
Here, it is worth mentioning that all the features mentioned
in Table II are highly dependent on each other. For instance,
there is a positive relationship between distance to basic
health units (BHUs), percentage of debts, toilet facilities, and
frequency of major illnesses. Due to debts and distance to
BHUs, minor illness turns into major.
Table III and Table IV shows the distance to BHUs and
hospitals, respectively. It is clear from Table III that in Barkot,
on average, each patient needs to cover a distance of 12.81
kilometres in order to reach a BHU with a standard deviation
(std.) of 9.91 kilometers. Similar results can be seen in Ta-

kilometers from Barkot and Muslimabad to reach hospitals.
In district of Haripur, mean poverty score is 29.94 [16].
This poverty score is reﬂected in Table 5, where 49.55%
of responders from Barkot are under the debt of more than
500,000 PKR.

Due to higher distance of BHUs and hospitals in Barkot,
people have to pay much more in order to reach the health
facility. Here, cost of travelling is more or equal to the cost
of treatment which results in higher debts and severe illness.
Table 6 shows the frequency of major/severe diseases. Here,
major/severe disease is deﬁned as an injury which requires two
or more days of bed rest or hospital admission. It also includes
disability.
Table IV-VI highlight the relationship between distance to
BHUs and hospitals, debts, and major illness which supports
our observation that socio-economic, geographical and cultural

norms highly affects the health-shocks, especially in the rural
and tribal areas.
Furthermore, it is interesting to see the houses with toilet
facilities have higher rate of minor and major diseases in
comparison to houses with no toilet facility as shown in Fig. 5.
One of the main reasons was access to water resources and
poor sewerage system. Here, it is worth mentioning that the
time required for household to collect water for one day usage
is almost 4 hours as in some cases, it takes a women 1.5 to
2 hours to reach the source. Same amount of time is required
to carry that water back home. Especially, in case of a family
with two to three children, it requires more than 5 or 6 buckets
of water at least for a day.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
Currently, there is no publicly available dataset that can
help to understand and monitor the health-shocks in Pakistan.
Such kind of surveys and datasets can be helpful to government
- who would use this dataset and resulting analysis to form
policies, to general practitioners and NGOs, in order to start
community based health programs. This dataset is our ﬁrst
initiative to analyse and understand the health-care system and
health-shocks, especially in rural and tribal areas of Pakistan
(For those who are interested in BMWT dataset, please contact:
mahmuds4@uni.coventry.ac.uk). Our proposed future work is
to apply machine learning techniques to an extended dataset
sampled from a larger population to develop a predictive
model of health-shocks that forms part of a framework which
