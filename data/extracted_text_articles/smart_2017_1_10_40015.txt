I.
INTRODUCTION
This article describes how Taiwan EPA leverages its
Smart
Environmental
Sensing
Web
comprising
crowdsourcing and crowdsharing [1] built on its existing
IoT-based environmental monitoring system. This Smart
Environmental
Sensing
Web
includes
continually
expanding
Micro
Environmental
Sensors,
an
environmental quality sensor networking platform, an
Environmental Info Push application for smart phones,
and an i-Environment website. Combining environmental
sensing data from different sources through common
transmission protocols and Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) Standards, we used data visualization technology
and
location-based
services
to
design
graphical
dashboards and interactive maps enabling users to access
real-time local environmental information at any time,
while also adding a convenient notification function that
sends alerts when needed.

We also encourage the deployment of sensors, Open
Data and crowdsharing to maximize the benefits of the
Smart Environmental Sensing Web. Users can not only
freely use these Open Data on environmental quality to
design their own innovative value-added services and
explore environmental issues, but also they can make use
of the existing platform to share their personal feelings
regarding the environment and publish these on the
community website. Users may also use community links
to stimulate other people’s concern about the quality of
living environment to create positive feedback cycle of
data flows (in Figure 1).
II. METHODS
A. Data enrichment— Crowdsourcing
In addition to collecting and disseminating the various
types of environmental monitoring information generated
by Taiwan EPA, the Smart Environmental Sensing
Network
will
also
incorporate
data
from
Micro
Environmental Sensors operated by local governments,
educational
institutions,
enterprises,
and
individuals.
These Micro Environmental Sensors (list in TABLE I.),
inspired by the Maker Movement, are designed to operate
as a network of sensors managed by the public and
experts.
The
sensors
will
continuously
monitor
air
pollutants (PM2.5), temperature, and humidity, and upload
their real-time sensing data via wifi to an open or self-
built IoT platforms. The platform provides Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) for Open Data to aid the
development of display interfaces and application services
for these types of environmental information. Currently,
the number of micro-sensors has reached 2,100 units,
which
are
mainly
distributed
in
Taiwan's
densely
populated metropolitan areas, as well as at public primary
schools in several counties and cities.

In order to increase the density of the environmental
sensing network, Taiwan EPA encourages citizens to join
the network by installing personal air sensors in their
living environment, such as AirBox and Location Aware
Sensing System (LASS), which monitors air quality that
people actually breathe. Since 2016, Taiwan EPA has also
continued to develop new sensors that can transmit real-
time data to the Smart Environmental Sensing Web via
other modes of transmission, such as Bluetooth, Wifi, or
Long range (LoRa) [3]. Since LoRa technology has
advantages of low power consumption and long range
capability, Taiwan EPA has begun deploying these
sensors in a certain industrial park.
The Environmental Info Push App provides the public
with environmental information that is updated every
minute. Internet access is all it takes for people to know
the air quality near their home or the place they plan to
visit, so they may take appropriate measures to protect
their health.
B. Technique of implementation
Through
the
Open
Platform
for
Environmental
Resources
[4],
Taiwan
EPA
compiles
real-time
monitoring information to create i-Environment [5], a
thematic interactive map browsing platform, and the
Environmental Info Push app to serve the people’s
demand for this type of information.

Figure 2. i-Environment Webpage (2016)
Based on governmental open data, “i-Environment” is
the first government website designed for the Hybrid
Web. It is developed using data visualization technology,
which
helps
present
reports,
statistics,
quantitative
figures, and other information in a visual manner. An
interface with dashboards and interactive maps provides
location-based services that allow users to easily browse
and search the environmental information they need (see
Figure 2). In addition to these convenient information
services, the sensor network also provides air quality
alerts to the public, along with suggestions for appropriate
activities under the various circumstances reminding users
of immediately responding to discomfort and risks from
environmental pollution, and to maintain their best health.
III. CURRENT PRACTICES—CROWDSHARING
To raise the public’s environmental awareness and
call attention for sources of air pollution in people’s
immediate
living
environment,
Taiwan
EPA
has
monitored
the
Mazu
Goddess
Tour,
a
month-long
procession of a sea goddess touring Taiwan, greeted by
the way by of celebrations involving massive fireworks
that push up PM2.5 values into the hundreds or even above
1,000 since 2016.
Firstly, in the spirit of crowdsourcing, EPA launched
AirPhoto, a function of Environmental Info Push app
through which people can share a photo stamping real-
time air quality data on it, and share the photo on the map
as well as on one’s own Facebook Wall. Thus, through
crowdsourcing and crowdsharing, the public is engaged as
“citizen sensors” and made more aware of environmental
issues.
Secondly, in response to the development era of
Internet of Things, Taiwan EPA has developed Bluetooth
transmission modules that can be deployed around
temples and those places where celebrations were held to
monitor the environmental conditions on the ground.
After the dynamic data was measured and uploaded, it can
be immediately seen on mobile phones with the app and
also uploaded to the IoT cloud platform of Taiwan EPA
(see Figure 3.).
Figure 3. New Structure of Environmental Sensing Web of EPA
（2017）
During events, people can view real-time information
on the i-Environment website, including real-time air
quality monitoring values, photos shared through the
AirPhoto, as well as statistical charts and data. In
addition, the public can use trend maps that compute
spatial changes in combination with real-time sensor
information and interactive features of maps on the i-
Environment website (see Figure 4).

IV. CONCLUSION
In light of the worldwide positive acclaim of Open
Data, Taiwan EPA will continue to maintain the concept
of open, transparent and innovative applications [6] to
serve society with public, diversified, and convenient
information
services
to
facilitate
people’s
decision-
making that involves environmental aspects. Taiwan EPA
furthermore hopes that the Smart Environmental Sensing
Web
along
with
the
relative
apps
will
encourage
crowdsourcing and crowdsharing to make the public more
concerned about the quality of their living environment,
and create positive feedback loops of information flows.
