Abstract— The purpose of this study is to develop an 
inventory-based control policy to reposition empty container in 
a multi-port system with uncertain customer demand. A single-
level policy with repositioning rule in terms of minimizing the 
repositioning cost is proposed to manage the empty container 
with periodical review. The objective is to optimize the 
parameters of the policy to minimize the expected total cost per 
period incurred by repositioning empty container, holding 
unused empty container and leasing empty container. The 
problem is solved by applying non-linear programming and a 
gradient search approach with Infinitesimal Perturbing 
Analysis (IPA) estimator. Numerical examples are given to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy.

 INTRODUCTION  
In the last few decades, the containerization of cargo 
transportation has been the fastest growing sector of the 
maritime industries. The growth of containerized shipping 
has presented challenges inevitably, in particular to the 
management of empty containers arising from the highly 
imbalanced trade between countries. It is reported that empty 
container movements constitute approximately 20% of the 
world ports handing activity ever since 1998 [1]. Song [2] 
reports that the cost of repositioning empty container is just 
under $15 billions, which is 27% of the total world fleet 
running cost based on the data for 2002. If the cost of 
repositioning empty container can be reduced, the shipping 
company could increase profit and improve competitiveness. 
Therefore, how to effectively and efficiently manage ECs is 
a very important issue for shipping company and it is known 
as empty container repositioning (ECR) problem. 
Much attention about ECR problem has been focused on 
utilizing mathematic models to solve this issue [3-7]. 
Mathematic models can often capture the nature of the 
problem, while give rise to concerns, such as requirement of 
a pre-specified planning horizon, sensitivity of the decisions 
to data accuracy and variability and implementation of the 
decisions in the stochastic systems [8, 9]. Recently, several 
authors turn to explore the inventory-based mechanism in 
addressing the ECR problem in the stochastic systems [2, 10, 
11]. These studies demonstrate that the optimal repositioning 
policies are of the threshold control type, characterized by 
some parameters and rules, in some situations such as one-
port and two-port systems. Researchers extend the above 
works to more general systems and focus on the 
implementation of threshold-type control policies [9, 12~14].  
In this paper, we consider the ECR problem in a multi-
port system which comprises a set of ports connected to each 
other and a fleet of owned containers are used to meet the 
stochastic customer demands. A single-level threshold policy 
with repositioning rule in terms of minimizing the 
repositioning cost is proposed to manage the EC with 
periodical review. The objective of the paper is to minimize 
the expected total cost per period, including transportation 
cost and holding and leasing cost by optimizing the 
parameters of the single-level policy. The paper is organized 
as follows. Section II presents the formulation for our 
problem. Section III describes the Infinitesimal Perturbation 
Analysis (IPA)-based gradient technique to solve the 
problem. Section IV illustrates the numerical studies. 
Conclusions are provided in the last section. 
II. 
PROBLEM FORMULATION 
We consider a multi-port system, consisting of ports 
connected with each other. A fleet of owned ECs meets 
exogenous customer demands, which are defined as the 
requirements for transforming ECs to laden containers and 
then transporting these laden containers from original ports 
to destination ports. A single-level threshold policy with 
periodical review is employed to manage the ECs. At the 
beginning of a period, the ECR decisions are made for each 
port, involving whether to reposition ECs, to/from which 
ports, and in what quantity. Then, when the customer 
demands occur in the period, we can use those containers 
that are currently stored at the port and those ECs that are 
repositioned to the port in the period to satisfy. If it is not 
enough, we need to lease additional ECs immediately from 
vendors. We make the following assumptions: 
 
The owned container fleet is fixed. 
 
Short-term leasing is considered and the quantity of 
the leased ECs is always available in the port at any 
time.  
 
The leased ECs are not distinguished from owned 
container. 
 
Twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) is used to 
represent a container. 
 
The travel time for each O-D pair       (from 
port   to port  ) is less than one period length. 
 
When the repositioned ECs arrive at the destination 
ports, they will become available immediately.

When the laden containers arrive at the destination 
ports, they will become empty and be available at 
the beginning of next period.

It should be pointed out that    is a given state variable, 
i.e., the given initial on-handing inventory; while    is a 
decision variable for    . The ECR decisions are made at 
the beginning of period   firstly. Then, the inventory position 
can be obtained by 
After customer demands are realized and the laden 
containers become available, the beginning on-hand 
inventory for the next period can be updated by 
Next, we present the single-level threshold policy to 
determine the repositioned quantities    in period  . 
B. A Single-Level Threshold Policy  
To make the ECR decisions, a single-level threshold 
policy is developed, which tries to maintain the inventory 
position at a target threshold value  . More specifically, 
port   has a target threshold, namely   ; in each period, such 
as in period  , if the beginning on-handing inventory of 
port  , namely      is greater than its threshold value, i.e.,   , 
then it is a surplus port and the quantity excess of    can be 
repositioned out to other ports that may need it to try to bring 
the inventory position down to   ; if      is less than   , then 
it is a deficit port and ECs should be repositioned into this 
port from surplus ports to try to bring the inventory position 
up to   ; if      is equal to   , then it is a balanced port and 
nothing is done. 
Without loss of generality, we consider the ECR 
decisions in period  . According to the threshold policy, 
three subsets, i.e., surplus port subset, deficit port subset and 
balanced port subset can be obtained as follows: 
   
             ;  
             ;   
             . 
When either the surplus port subset or the deficit port subset 
is empty, we do nothing. That is, no ECs are repositioned 
and we can have     . However, when   
  and   
  are 
nonempty, we can compute the amounts of EC supplies of 
surplus ports and EC demands of deficit ports by: 
Then, the problem is about moving ECs from surplus ports to 
deficit ports in the right quantity at the least movement cost. 
A transportation model is formulated to solve this problem as 
follows: 
Constraints (6) and (7) are resource constraints. Constraint 
(8) implies that the amount of total exported ECs from the 
surplus ports is capacitated by the amount of total demands 
of all deficit ports; thus, we can try to bring the inventory 
position of each port back to its threshold level. Constraints 
(9) are the non-negative repositioned EC quantity 
constraints.  
Solving the transportation model, we can obtain the 
repositioned quantities from the surplus ports to the deficit

ports. To further complete the value of   , which involves 
the repositioned quantities for all ports, we set         
                         for a balanced port     
 , 
                  for a surplus port     
  and        
           for a deficit port     
 , which reflect the 
facts that a balanced port does not reposition in or out ECs, a 
surplus port does not reposition in ECs and a deficit port 
does not reposition out ECs, respectively. 
C. The Optimization Problem 
Let        be the expected total cost per period with the 
fleet size   and policy parameter  . The problem, which is to 
find the optimal parameters of the given policy, 
namely    that minimizes the expected total cost per period 
can be formulated as 
subject to the single-level threshold policy, the given fleet 
size   and the inventory dynamics equations (1) and (2). 
With a slight misuse of the notation, we drop the 
subscript   in the notations of             and     
  for ease of 
description. More specifically,        can be formulated as: 
where          is the total cost in one period;       and 
        are the EC repositioning cost and  the total EC 
holding and leasing cost in one period, respectively. We have 
where        
   represents the EC holding and leasing cost 
of port   in one period;             . 
Next, we consider the problem under balanced scenario, 
followed by that under unbalanced scenario. Here, balanced 
(unbalanced) scenario is the scenario in which the total 
amount of estimated EC supply is equal (not equal) to the 
total amount of estimated EC demand in each period. From 
(3) and (4), it is observed that  
     
 
    
 
  
    
 
    
 
   
 
     
. Hence, a scenario with  
     
   is a balanced 
scenario and a scenario with  
     
   is an unbalanced 
scenario. 
1) Balanced Scenario: Consider the problem in the 
balanced scenario. We can obtain the optimal solution of 
(10) analytically, since it only depends on the holding and 
leasing cost function. The explanations are as follows.  
From the transportation models, we know that the 
repositioning out (in) requirement of each surplus (deficit) 
port can be fully satisfied in each period in a balanced 
scenario. Thus, after making ECR decisions, the inventory 
position level of each port can be always kept at its target 
threshold level. It implies that the estimated EC supply 
(demand) of the surplus (deficit) port in a period, except the 
initial period, will be independent from the parameters of the 
fleet size and the thresholds, and just depend on its customer 
demands in the previous period. Consequently, the EC 
transportation cost and the total EC holding and leasing cost 
in one period will be independent; and the expected EC 
transportation cost per period will be independent from 
parameters of    and   . Further speaking, the optimal 
solution only depends on the expected total EC holding and 
leasing cost function. The problem (10) in the balanced 
scenario can be simplified to an non-linear programming as: 
where the value of fleet size   is given. 
Considering the convexity of the above cost function and 
taking use of the K.K.T. conditions, we can obtain the 
optimal solution of the NLP by solving (14) and (15). 
where     is the Lagrange Multiplier of the balance 
constraint. 
Remark: Let        be the optimal thresholds in the 
balanced scenario with given fleet size. Given customer 
demands, we know that       can achieve the minimum 
holding and leasing cost for the problem (10). However, it 
may not achieve the minimum expected total cost per period 
for the problem, because we can find other thresholds 
achieving less transportation costs than that achieved 
by     . For example, when we set all the thresholds going 
to infinite so that no ECs will be repositioned, the 
transportation cost in this scenario will be zero and less than 
that in the scenario with      . Thus, we next consider the 
unbalanced scenario. 
2) Unbalanced Scenario: Consider the problem in the 
unbalanced scenario. By taking advantage of the structure of 
the problem, we find an interesting property about the 
transportation cost as follows: 
Property I: In an unbalanced scenario, the transportation 
cost in a period, except the initial period, could be less than 
or equal to that in a balanced scenario with same customer 
demands. 
Intuitively, for example, if a exported-dominated port has the 
probability to become a surplus port, i.e., it needs to 
reposition out ECs to other ports, repositioning in less ECs 
than its threshold in this port in advance when it becomes a 
surplus port will reduce its EC repositioning out quantity. 
Hence, less transportation cost in a period in an unbalanced 
scenario could be occurred.   
Since there is no closed-form formulation for the 
computation of expected total cost per period in the 
unbalanced scenario involving the repositioned EC quantities 
from the transportation models, we adopt the simulation to 
estimate        given values of   and   as shown in (16).   
where             is the total cost in period  ;         and 
         are the EC repositioning cost and  the total EC

holding and leasing cost in period   and can be obtained from 
(12) and (13), respectively;   is the amount of the simulation 
periods. It is significant to highlight that solving (10) in the 
unbalanced scenario is difficult. In order to find an optimal 
solution to the problem, we need to use a search-based 
method. In next section, we develop an optimization 
technique namely IPA-based gradient technique. 
Summarizing above discussions, we can get that given 
fleet size and customer demands, the minimum expected 
total cost per period could be achieved in either the balanced 
scenario or unbalanced scenario. The optimal solution under 
balanced scenario can be obtained analytically by solving 
(14) and (15), and under unbalanced scenario by applying 
the proposed IPA-based gradient technique. 
III. 
IPA-BASED GRADIENT TECHNIQUE 
IPA is able to estimate the gradient of the objective 
function from one single simulation run, thus reducing the 
computational time. Moreover, it has been shown that 
variance of IPA estimator is lower, compared with many 
other gradient estimators [15]. Thus, we propose an IPA-
based gradient technique to search the optimal solution in the 
unbalanced scenario. The overall IPA-based gradient 
technique is briefly described in Fig. 1. 
As shown in Fig. 1, given the parameters of the fleet 
size   and the policy   with  
     
  , we first calculate 
the total cost and estimate the gradient of total cost with 
respect to the thresholds in all periods. We estimate the 
gradient in a period using the concept of perturbation 
propagation from IPA [16], the dual information of the LP 
model and the chain rule. Then, we can obtain the expected 
total cost per period  and the gradient of        . This 
gradient can provide a direction for finding new parameters 
of the policy that may have a lower expected total cost per 
period and hence the hill climbing algorithm is used to 
update the parameters of the policy. Finally, when the 
termination criteria are satisfied, the simulation is stopped. 
To estimate the gradient of expected total cost per period, 
we take a partial derivation of (16) with respect to the 
threshold of port  . With the help of (13), we can obtain 
where for the inventory holding and leasing cost function, 
we use the expected holding and leasing cost function to 
estimate the gradient instead of using the sample path since 
we are able to get the explicit function to evaluate the 
average gradient;          
 
 measures the impact of the 
transportation cost in period    when the threshold is 
changed;              
       
 
 measures the impact of the 
holding and leasing cost function of port   in period   when 
the inventory position level is changed;         
 
 measures 
the impact of the inventory position level of port    in 
period   when the threshold is changed. 
 
      
We define the nominal path as the sample path generated 
by the simulation model with parameter   and the perturbed 
path as the sample path generated using the same model and 
same random seeds, but with parameter     , where      
    . Without loss of generality, we only perturb the 
threshold of port   and keep the thresholds of the other ports 
unchanged, i.e.,               and      
     for other 
port  , where the value of     is infinitesimally small. By 
“sufficiently” small, we mean such that the surplus port 
subset and deficit port subset are same in the both nominal 
and perturbed paths in every period. Oftentimes, we will 
present the changes in various quantities by displaying with 
argument   . We perturb     in all periods and the 
representative perturbation flow in period   is shown in the 
Fig. 2. 
In our problem with real variables, the probability of 
having balanced port is close to 0. In other word, 
port   should be either surplus port or deficit port in period  . 
From (3) and (4), we can derive that       
 
       
         
  and      
                 
 . Hence, in 
Fig. 2, the perturbation of     will work together with the 
perturbation 
of      to 
affect 
the 
estimated 
EC 
supply/demand, namely       
       
  for some ports. We 
know that the estimated EC supply/demand of a port is the 
RHS of the corresponding port’s constraint in the 
transportation model. It implies that the perturbations of

repositioning quantities of some ports, which, of course, will 
affect the total optimal repositioned out/in quantities of some 
ports, namely

work together with the perturbation of

ports to affect the perturbation on EC inventory positions, 
namely       for some ports. Furthermore, the perturbation 
of      
       
  will affect the transportation cost and the 
perturbation of       will affect the total holding and leasing 
cost. From (2), we have        , which implies that the 
perturbation on the inventory position will be fully 
propagated to the beginning on-hand inventory of next 
period.

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section we aim to evaluate the performance of the 
proposed 
single-level 
threshold 
policy 
(STP). 
For 
comparison, a match back policy (MBP) is introduced. Such 
policy is widely accepted and applied in practice and its 
basic principle is to match the containers back to the original 
port. Mathematically,    
The NLP in the balanced scenario is solved by Matlab 
(version 7.0.1). The IPA-gradient based algorithm is coded 
in Visual C++ 5.0. All the numerical studies are tested on 
and Intel Duo Processor E6750 2.67GHz CPU with 4.00 GB 
RAM under the Microsoft Vista Operation System. We set 
the simulation period          with warm-up period    
=100. For the STP, the termination criteria are that the 
maximum iteration for finding the optimal thresholds, 
namely      is achieve, or the expected total cost in the 
iteration   is larger than that in the previous iteration. We 
set           . For the MBP, since the transportation cost 
is independent from the parameter of fleet size, we set the 
inventory position in the initial period be equal to the optimal 
inventory position which minimizing the expected holding 
and leasing cost.  
For a three-port system, we compare the performance of 
both policies based on the expected total cost per period. we 
give the fleet size from 483 TEUs to 1128 TEUs to 
investigate the effect of the fleet size on the expected total 
cost. Fig. 3 shows the results. It is observed that STP 
outperforms MBP for all cases. The expected total cost per 
period savings achieved by STP over MBP are of the order 
of 12.75%~37.18%. One possible explanation is that STP 
makes the ECR decisions in terms of minimizing the 
transportation cost.  Hence, it is important for operators to 
use intelligent method in repositioning ECs, instead of 
resorting to simple way such as the MBP.

From Fig. 3, it reveals that the optimal average total cost 
appears to be convex with respect to the fleet size for each 
system. It reflects the intuition that the optimal fleet size is 
the trade-off between the transportation cost and the holding 
and leasing cost.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, the EC repositioning problem in a multi-
port system is considered. A single-level inventory-based 
policy with the repositioning rule in terms of minimizing 
transportation cost is developed to reposition ECs 
periodically by taking into account demand uncertainty and 
dynamic 
operations. 
Two 
approaches, 
non-linear 
programming and IPA-based gradient technique are 
developed to solve the problem optimizing thresholds of 
policy 
under 
balanced 
and 
unbalanced 
scenarios, 
respectively. The numerical results provide insights that by 
repositioning the ECs intelligently, we can significantly 
reduce the total operation cost.  
The main contributions of the study are as follows: (a) a 
single-level threshold policy with a repositioning rule in 
terms of minimizing transportation cost is developed for 
repositioning ECs in a multi-port system. To the best of our 
knowledge, few works consider the repositioning rule which 
is related to the transportation costs; (b) by developing the 
method to solve the difficult ECR problem, i.e., using IPA to 
estimate the gradient, it is innovative and provides a potential 
methodology contribution in this field 
We strongly assumed that the ECs are dispatched 
between each pair of ports in one period. It may not be the 
right one period in some general cases. Further research is 
needed to relax the one-period assumption and consider the 
problem with different time dimension for the repositioning 
time. The main challenge is to track the perturbations along 
the sample path.
