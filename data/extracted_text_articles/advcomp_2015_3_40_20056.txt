Abstract-This 
paper 
proposes 
a 
semantic 
similarity 
clustering algorithm on the cluster analysis of large-scale social 
network. By utilizing the semantic hierarchy of WordNet, the 
proposed method defines the key concept sets and the concept 
feature values for the community. In our method, the semantic 
relations between concepts of the community nodes are also 
constructed, which expands the application of clustering 
algorithms from text documents to social network. The cluster 
structures derived from the proposed algorithm are in 
concordance with peoples' judgments on a specific area, which 
will lead to the solution of the clustering problems in the social 
network of different areas. Compared with VSM and 
k-MEANS, the experiment results show that the proposed 
algorithm obtains more reasonable results, which validates its 
effectiveness.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Semantic similarity [1][2] is a concept with various 
definitions according to different areas. Taking the term 
"virus" as an example, the similarities of virus and its 
categories differ when it is taken to the biological area and 
computer area. This is caused by different definitions in 
these two areas. Therefore, understanding the definition 
other than the term itself becomes more and more important.  
The WordNet ontology [3] is an online word sense 
mapping system, containing concept word sets from different 
areas and relationships among them with a sematic network 
structure. Based on WordNet, this paper extracts words and 
constructs a semantic IS-A relationship hierarchy and mixes 
concept word set into the standard hierarchical structure.  
It is difficult to calculate similarity about different 
weighted features and classification learning from the long 
text and web document processing. The most popular 
methods for solving the problems are applying to vector 
space model (VSM) [4][5]. Most of these algorithms are 
costly in computing power, and some algorithms need some 
background knowledge, as well as manpower. Therefore, it 
is difficult to apply these algorithms in the unstructured 
social networks. Especially, when the nodes with similar 
meanings have few common words in the community 
structure, VSM will heavily affect the effect of cluster 
finding and result in serious deviation from actual structure. 
For example, the "sports community" and "badminton clubs" 
should belong to the topic of sports, but the VSM will return 
0 in sematic similarity due to no common words. 
The social networks are abstractions of complex systems 
and each node in the social network represents the individual 
unit in the complex system. The edges between nodes are 
relationships in the social network formed according to some 
certain rules. There are various types of social networks in 
the real world, such as social network, biological network, 
etc. Finding community structure is not a random selection 
in a large number of nodes with same properties, but a 
discrimination in nodes with different types, among which 
the nodes with same property are linked with more 
connections, while different types of nodes are sparsely 
connected. Finding community structures within a social 
network is an important step towards clustering analysis and 
research of the network.  
Clustering is an important method in finding community 
structure. 
Through 
the 
clustering 
method, 
internal 
regulations and characteristics can be discovered. The 
clustering algorithms is capable of automatically generating 
the category number without adding manual annotation and 
training classifier. As an unsupervised machine learning

method, clustering has a higher flexibility and better 
automatic processing power. As the increasing tendency of 
community information dependence [6][7][8][9], people 
require intelligent information processing other than the 
processing of the word pattern or word sense. Therefore, the 
semantic similarity computing becomes one of the ways to 
solve community clustering problem. It is crucial in 
improving the effectiveness and accuracy of the clustering 
result, judging community structure correlations, classifying 
communities, and mining data. 
This paper proposes a WordNet semantic network 
learning method. By utilizing the semantic hierarchy of 
WordNet, the proposed method defines the key concept sets 
[10] and the concept feature values for the community and 
then use them to define the semantic similarity. According to 
the semantic similarity, a community clustering method in 
social network is presented. The cluster structures derived 
from the proposed algorithm are in concordance with the 
judgments of peoples on a specific area, which will lead to 
the solution of the clustering problems in the social network 
of different areas. Compared with VSM and k-MEANS [11], 
the proposed algorithm discovers more reasonable results 
and shows its effectiveness. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
provides some relevant knowledge. In Section III, we 
propose a high performance cluster algorithm (CASN). The 
experiments and results are presented in Section IV. Finally, 
Section V concludes our work. 
II. RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE 
A. WordNet Ontology 
WordNet is a widely used English words knowledge base 
and widely applied in natural language processing, semantic 
translation, which has attracted much international attention 
[12]. WordNet is organized by sematic relations. It uses 
synonym sets (synsets) to representative concepts. Keywords 
in synsets are bounded and the sematic relationships between 
synsets are also kept in the hierarchy. One word can be 
mapped into several synsets and one synset contains several 
words, which provides a way on representing semantic 
relationships into the relationships between the concept sets 
and synsets. WordNet semantic relationships mainly include: 
the parent and child, synonymous, antonym, is-a-part-of and 
containment, attribute properties, "leading to" relationships 
and so on. Based on the English WordNet, the Chinese 
WordNet is an ontology of the Chinese words and the 
concept word set, by using existing English-Chinese 
dictionary library to translate the word in English into 
Chinese and get the knowledge base. It also has the functions 
of the concept word, same-word and pan-word. The key 
concept word is the basic element of Chinese WordNet, and 
use a number of relation types to connect these concept 
words, which leads to a key concept word set. 
B. Similarity Calculation 
The calculation of similarities between any two words 
starts from mapping the words into the concept word sets 
that they belong to, and then calculates the similarities 
between each pair. Finally, according to these similarities of 
concepts word sets, the word similarities are achieved. 
1) The concept word and similarity 
For the convenience of knowledge sharing and reuse, 
WordNet clearly defines concepts of different areas and their 
relationships. Since there is no formal standard, the 
descriptions of the same problem in different areas will be 
different. Even in the same area, different ontologies may 
also have some heterogeneity. This will significantly affect 
the utilization of WordNet. The ontology mapping is one of 
the ways to resolve this heterogeneous problem, while the 
similarity calculation is a key part of the ontology mapping. 
Definition 1 (concept word): Concept is an abstract 
description of the objects in real world. A concept word is 
defined as a triad Con={N, A, R}, where N is the name, A is 
the attribute set, R is the relationship set. The name and 
attribute describe the internal characteristics of the concept, 
relationship set and express the relation between concept and 
external environment, and also reflect the external 
characteristics of concept. Concept words can be represented 
by instances and therefore be more specific in concept 
meaning. 
Definition 2 (similarity): By the definition 1, it is 
known that the concept word has three important elements, 
including name, attribute and relationship. So the similarity 
58

calculation also contains those three components. WordNet 
is seen as a semantic tree organized according to the 
hierarchical relationships and concept word relationships. In 
this paper, the similarity calculation is based on the word 
content similarity in WordNet, which is the semantics 
distance between them, in other words it is the path length of 
two semantics in the semantic tree. Similarity values range 
from 0 to 1. If two concept words are completely different, 
the similarity is 0. If they are identical, the similarity is 1. 
The similarity is calculated by (1), where len(w1, w2) is the 
path length from the word w1 to the word w2.

a) The concept name similarity SIMcn 
Usually, the concept word in WordNet is a compound 
word and it is to determine its semantic distance directly. 
Therefore, the first several steps will be word segmentation 
and stopping-word removal to form a stopping-word table 
and key words extraction. Equation (1) is used to calculate 
key words similarities and get the summation to represent the 
similarity of concept name as (2).

where, c1i is the key word of concept c1, i‚àà[1,n]. c2j is the 
key word of concept c2, j‚àà[1,m]. 
b)The attribute similarity SIMa 
Attribute consists of attribute names (reflect attribute 
contents) and attribute domain (attributes' value ranges). 
Therefore, the attribute similarity calculation must include 
attribute name similarity and attribute domain similarity, 
which is described as follows: 
ùëÜùêºùëÄùëé(ùëé1, ùëé2) = ùëÜùêºùëÄùëéùëõ(ùëé1, ùëé2) + 1
ùëõ ùëÜùêºùëÄùëéùëë(ùëé1, ùëé2)           (3) 
SIMan(a1,a2) is the attribute name similarity, which can use 
a similar concept name similarity calculation method to 
calculate the result. SIMad(a1, a2) is the attribute domain 
similarity, and it mates calculate. 
c) The relationship similarity SIMr 
Relationship similarity reflects the connection degree 
between concept and external. The similarity calculation 
includes two parts: the relationship name similarity and the 
relationship association concept similarity, which is 
described as follows: 
ùëÜùêºùëÄùëü(ùëü1, ùëü2) = 1
ùëõ ùëÜùêºùëÄùëüùëõ(ùëü1, ùëü2) + 1
ùëõ ùëÜùêºùëÄùëüùëê(ùëüùëê1, ùëüùëê2)        Ôºà4Ôºâ 
SIMrn(r1,r2) is the relationship name similarity, achieved 
by similar calculation method as concept name similarity. 
SIMrc(rc1,rc2) is the association concept similarity, and it is 
calculated from the concept name similarity of association 
concept, where rc1 represents the concept of associate 
relation r1, and rc2 represents the concept of associate 
relation r2. 
2) The semantic similarity 
Semantic similarity calculation principle can be described 
as follows: 
a) According to the relation between parent and child in 
WordNet, the further the distance between any two concept 
word nodes is, the smaller the semantic similarity is. 
b) The higher density the concept word node locates at, 
the finer the local concepts are divided, which leads to a 
lower similarity. 
As for two concept word nodes with the same distance, 
the deeper level it locates at, the more specific it will be, 
which means that the greater similarity is assigned. 
The semantic similarity calculation formula is defined as 
follow: 
ùëÜùêºùëÄ = ùúé + ùõº √ó ùúëÃÖ + ùõΩ √ó ùúîÃÖ                 Ôºà5Ôºâ 
where, Œ± and Œ≤ are the weights of depth factor and density 
factor respectively, œÉ is the distance factor , œÜ is the density 
factor and œâ is the depth factor. 
C. The Key Concept Word Set and Concept Feature Value 
of Community 
In the community clustering process, different community 
structure or different keyword density in community will 
lead to the distorted structure. Especially when the 
community data is in a high dimension, the quality, effect 
and the calculation speed of the clustering are significantly 
decreased. In order to improve the efficiency of the 
clustering, the dimension reduction method is a better choice.

At present, the dimension reduction methods mainly includes 
TF-IDF, information gain (IG), mutual information (MI), etc. 
[12][13], which are based on the lexical frequency statistics 
information. For the convenience of clustering operation, a 
structuring process for nodes in social network is required, 
which includes: establishing the community key concept 
word set and extracting concept feature values, and forming 
structured documents with key concept words. Similar with 
the text document processing, the words in structured 
documents can be divided into two classes: the function 
words and the content words. The function words are particle, 
which have no real meaning, while the content words are 
meaningful. According to the features of content words in 
the network, such as frequencies, positions and so on, 
weights are assigned to these words to obtain the concept 
feature values. This value is propositional to the frequency of 
the associated concept and if a concept appears in the title of 
the network, its concept feature value will be increased. 
When a certain concept feature value is greater than a given 
threshold, this word can be regarded as a key concept word. 
At present, for clustering purpose, a document is always 
transformed into a noun list and the contribution of words' 
frequencies to the content of the document is ignored [14], 
which will lead to an unsatisfying performance. In this paper, 
the key concept word list illustrated in (6) is utilized, where a 
social network is regarded as a two-dimension array includes 
the concept words and their frequencies, to meet the 
requirement of clustering in the social network.

In (7), wi is the i-th concept appearing in community and fi 
is the frequency associated with wi. fi is calculated by the 
frequency function, namely: 
ùê∑ = {(ùë§1, ùëì1), (ùë§2, ùëì2), ‚Ä¶ , (ùë§ùëõ,ùëìùëõ)}          Ôºà7Ôºâ 
In (8), Ti is the feature value associated with the i-th 
concept word appearing in community; TFi is the times 
which the first i concept word appearing in the community; 
mi is the number of communities containing the first i 
concept word; M is the total number of the concept word in 
community. From (8), it is obvious that the feature value of a 
concept word is proportional to the frequency that the 
concept word appearing in sentence, and in inverse 
proportional to the number of communities containing the 
concept word.

III. HIGH PERFORMANCE CLUSTER ALGORITHM CASN 
At present, no clustering algorithm could be generally 
applicable to the social network in revealing the complex 
structures 
that 
are 
represented 
by 
all 
kinds 
of 
multi-dimensional data sets. Generally, clustering algorithms 
can be classified into partitioning clustering, hierarchical 
clustering and density based clustering. The classic 
partitioning algorithms are vector space model clustering and 
k-neighborhood clustering [15], which are efficient for large 
data sets and applicable to Web document clustering 
applications. The hierarchical clustering algorithms use the 
association rules to split or cluster data in a hierarchical form 
to provide solution for hierarchical clustering. They are 
mostly applied in small data set. 
To address the problems of predefined cluster number, 
initial value selection and local optimal issue, this paper 
proposes a clustering algorithm based on semantic similarity, 
called CASN (Clustering Algorithm of Social Network) to 
efficiently solve the community clustering problem in social 
networks. 
A. Basic Ideas 
The basic idea of our proposed social network community 
clustering algorithm is to define the node distance between 
community structures, which represents the similarity 
between community structures by the node semantic 
similarity (as shown in Figure 1). According to the 
similarities, the nodes are clustered one by one, and the 
closely related clusters will gather into a bigger cluster unit, 
which will grow in size gradually until all nodes form a 
cluster.

B. The details of the algorithm CASN 
The first step of CASN includes the network structuration 
and feature extraction. The WordNet concepts and the 
semantic relationships among concepts are used to generate 
key concept sets and the concept feature values representing 
the community structure. Then the clustering algorithm 
based on the key concept set and the concept feature value is 
executed. Finally, the key concept set is used to express each 
clustered unit. 
1) The key concept set extraction algorithm CASN-CSET 
Clustering Algorithm of Social Network for Concept Set 
(CASN-CSET) algorithm scans through the identification of 
each network nodes to extract semantics and maps the 
extracted nouns into concept by WordNet. Each of the 
concept is initialized with an interpretation weight. The 
whole process is described in Figure 2. 
Algorithm input: The network node identification

Algorithm output: The key concept of each network 
node in the document set D, ConSET [i].

file=nextfile (D); //take a network node document in order  
if (isnull(file))  
continue = false; 
else { 
titlewords = gettitle(file); 
word=first(titlewords); //extract the first semantic word 
titlewords.remove(word);  
/* remove the semantic word which have taken out and  
update titlewords */ 
} 
while(isnotnull(word)) { 
conceptnode = lookupindexword(word, noun); 
if (isnotnull(conceptnode))  
ConSET[I].add(conceptnode,1); 
/*if concept nodes exist,then join ConSET[i],  
the weight is 1*/ 
word = first(titlewords);

The similarity matrix is calculated based on the key 
concept set and its concept feature vector and its weight 
coefficient. Then two clusters c1 and c2 are found which 
their similarity degree are the biggest in the clusters. 
IV. THE EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS 
A. Experimental Data 
The algorithm's experimental data are taken from 10 
discussion groups of a Bulletin Board System (BBS). The 
discussion groups contain about more than 20000 discussion 
topics with a total number of 65000 entries. 
B. Evaluation Standard 
This paper adopts the NMI (Number Mutual Information) 
analysis method based on mutual information within clusters 
or categories. As stated by Deng and al. [14], this method 
can eliminate the influence on the final clustering result 
caused by the number of clusters. The closer the NMI values 
are, the better the clustering result is. The NMI value is

where nh is the number of data sample in categories h, nl is 
the number of data sample in categories l, nh,l is the same 
data samples in both of the categories h and l, n is the total 
number of sample data. 
C. The Experimental Result 
The experiment uses the key concept set and concept 
feature value to calculate the similarity of the text. kc and cf 
are the parameters to adjust the key concept set and concept 
feature value. Figure 5 shows the effects of clustering by 
computing NMI under different ratio of kc:cf. We can see 
that when kc:cf =1:9, the clustering algorithm has the best 
performance. 
In Figure 6, CASN is compared with other clustering 
algorithms, set kc:cf =1:9Ôºåthe NMI value of CASN is about 
0.6 when the cluster number is 10; meanwhile, NMI value of 
VSM algorithm is less than 0.5 but greater than 0.4, and 
K-means algorithm only get 0.4 on NMI; Even with the 
cluster number increasing, the NMI values of CASN 
algorithm are all near 0.6, which is  superior to VSM and 
K-means. The testing results meet the requirements perfectly, 
which shows the validity and effectivity of the presented 
algorithms.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper studied the community clustering algorithm 
based on semantic similarity under the social network 
scenario and proposed a feature value using WordNet 
semantic words which can construct community key concept 
set to express the community concept. Compared with 
clustering methods using space vector model SVM, the 
proposed algorithm shows a better performance. By 
introducing semantic relations between concept word set 
(also called synonyms set) and concepts to describe network 
nodes, our proposed algorithm reduces the dimension of 
feature lists representing community nodes, and therefore 
can be applied to the clustering analysis of the community 
structure. The method proposed in this paper deserves more 
research on some problems in the future. For example, the 
hierarchical relationships of the WordNet ontology is still 
not yet fully utilized. Some fuzzy concept word sets are hard 
to be defined and a better solution is also required to improve 
the clustering accuracy.
