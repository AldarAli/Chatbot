I. INTRODUCTION
Williams [6] shows that many utilities in the practice of
managing
information
remains
undisciplined
and
unfocused. This can be seen by several aspects. It shows for
example, at high costs and locked in resources associated
with the development and redundant maintenance. Also, it
is
seen
at
overlapping
point-to-point
interfaces,
an
unmanaged glut of information (such as an accelerating
volume and velocity of information sources) and an
inflexibility of system design. All of these aspects cause a
delay in response to evolving business needs. Utility IT
(Information
Technology)
personals,
engineers
and
operations leaders have recognized the need for asset data
management. They recognize the value of enterprise GIS
(Geographic Information System) as the required vehicle
for asset data management.
Sami [4] presents that the major benefit to be derived
from using GIS is the integration of disparate information
systems, many of which already exist but which cannot
communicate or exchange data effectively.
EPR (Emergency Response Planning) systems have
been deployed with an overarching purpose to reduce the
costs by managing processes and materials. The principal
benefit of a consolidated ERP strategy was to ensure that
data was not duplicated across departments, eliminating
“islands of information”. Once the processes are separated,
then they can now be linked, enabling the enterprise for
wide planning and optimization. The changed competitive
landscape
will
demand
that
ERP
supports
all
goals
regardless of their locations in an organization’s value
network. Only then, enterprises can mobilize quickly and
respond effectively to events as they occur at breakneck
speed.
One of the main strategic objectives in the enterprise
organizations is to develop the media, which can be used to
analyze and show the impact of various and heterogonous
workflows for achieving the scope with minimum time and
cost and most attainable quality. VCDM is the approach
which
we
will
follow.
Creation of VCDM is very
challenging when we want to see the impact of completely
different management plans within the organization. The
following
different
systems
and
plans
(impact
of
engineering
system,
field’s
development
system,
exploration
system,
human
resources
and
training
management plans) have effects on each other. Combining
the data from these systems will enable the user to reach the
strategic organizational objectives. This challenge could be
resolved through the SDM concept.
SDM concept is based on management and analysis of
heterogeneous workflows through the spatial integrity in
GIS environment. SDM relies on spatial modeling and
analyzing
workflow
work
packages
or
activities
for
planning, monitoring and controlling process for various
business
workflows.
Analysis
and
implementation
of
workgroups of common processes for various workflows
are more scalable and accurate than relying on common
elements. It is difficult to identify the common elements
among the heterogonous workflows, whereas analyzing the
activities of processes common among these workflows
could overcome this issue.

The state of the art is to form the SDM model. This
SDM model will overcome the complexity of the existing
approaches. It reduces maintenance and operation costs.
Also, the responses are fast .
The critical point in SDM approach is creation of the
spatial correlation between the analyzed and decomposed
activities. The most efficient approach is forming the spatial
risk data model. The decomposed work groups from various
workflows can be spatially analyzed and managed, and then
correlated using spatial risk data model. This paper presents
a method to show how GIS can be utilized and managed as
a unified geo framework through the development of spatial
data model for ERP (Emergency Response Plan) for Oil and
Electric Networks. The first section in this paper is about
the spatial management of ERP for H2S (Hydrogen
Sulphide) dispersion. The second part is about the spatial
model of electric power networks in risk assessment
management.
II. GIS AS UNIFIED GEO FRAMEWORK FOR
EPZ (EMERGENCY PLANNING ZONES)
This case involves finding the shortest and the least cost
path for Hydrogen Sulphide pipe line by constructing the
proper models needed. Spatial risk score matrix is being
developed. Different and needed zones are determined.
These obtained data are fed to GIS system to find the
targeted spatial model for the study case.
A.
Objective
The goal is to implement spatial risk model derived
from H2S (Hydrogen Sulphide) dispersion model to be the
foundation of ERP management in GIS (Geographic
Information System).
B.
Scope
The scope is to create dispersion risk model for H2S
derived from EUB (Energy and Utility Board) dispersion
calculation model. Then, calculated
EPZ (Emergency
Planning Zones) spatially for sour wells based on phase
operation is implemented. Wind magnitude and direction
impact in case of calculated protective action zone are
considered..
Capability of creating actual EPZ zones is based on
geospatial
analysis
relationships.
These
zones
are
recognized with respect to the available geographic objects.
For example, these objects can be the access routes and
their availability..
Implement the spatial risk assessment score matrix per
sour well to enable the spatial management of ERP type
related to the well based on its status.
C.
Proposed spatial data model for ERP management
based on the spatial risk model
Figure 1 shows the proposed spatial ERP data model
based on the developed spatial risk model derived from the
defined spatial and non-spatial probable parameters as well
as the related consequence analysis for H2S dispersion
through which the emergency level could be specified as
well as related ERP modules. Different factors related to the
spatial situation in question is being taking care off. Figure
2 shows proposed flow chart of spatial ERP management
based on EPZ consequence analytical zones.
D.
Customized spatial risk model using python script in
ESRI environment
The data needed are being gathered. These data are
being put in the proper form for ESRI computer software
environment. Figure 3 shows the customized GIS model
used to extract the main output parameters from the
calculated EUB (Energy and Utility Board) for H2S
calculation model. Such parameters are the calculated EPZ
(Emergency Planning
Zone), PAZ
(Protective
Action
Zone),
IIZ
(Initial
Isolation
Zone)
distances,
H2S
concentration, wind magnitude, phase operation, and other
mandatory parameters to be accounted for in the spatial risk
model.
E.
Create spatial risk model
This model will indicate the amount of risk involved
depending on the probability analysis needed. The spatial
EPZ, PAZ, IIZ per analytical asset or element (sour well) is
being created. Then, the spatial risk model can be obtained
based on EPZ consequence analysis and the defined impact
parameters.
Figure 4 shows the initial output of the spatial risk H2S
dispersion model based on the calculated EPZ zones from
EUB for H2S dispersion model, as well as the creation of
initial spatial risk model.
F.
The final resized EPZ, PAZ, IIZ with the modified
spatial risk model
The final spatial model will detect and adapt to changes.
Figure 5 shows how the spatial model is intelligent enough
to detect any change in the defined risk parameters whether
spatial, environmental (e.g., wind direction and magnitude
from sensors, etc.) or non spatial risk parameters (e.g.,
uncontrolled flow, etc.) and adapt accordingly.
III. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE FOR SPATIAL
DATA MODEL OF ELECTRIC POWER NETWORK
This case presents how to find the shortest and the least
cost path for electrical line by obtaining the proper models
needed. The spatial location ID code consists of the
following needed codes: Utility code - Province code - City
code - District or village code - Distributer code.
A single line diagram shown in Figure 6 is composed of
five medium voltage cells. It shows two incoming cells, two
outgoing cells, and one bus tie cell. Each cell is controlled
and protected by one medium voltage circuit breaker and
two isolating switches.
The spatial location ID shown in TABLE I provides the
operator with the illustrative specific location of each
element of the concerned network starting from the electric

IV. EQUATIONS FOR SPATIAL RISK SCORE
MATRIX DEVELOPMENT AND ERP SPATIAL
MANAGEMENT
In this section, the needed and used mathematical
formulae are being presented. The zones EPZ, PAZ, IIZ are
created for each case study based on the evaluated
consequence analytical values:
1)
Refined EPZ radius = EPZ calculated (1 + Related
consequence value).
[1] [ 2].
The actual EPZ is calculated based on the impact of
spatial and non-spatial parameters on the consequence
matrix.
2)
(Total Of Risk) TOR = (Probability * Consequence)
per asset or analytical element.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the role of spatial model is being applied
to obtain integration between various workflows. The
concept of VCDM (Virtual Common Data Model) concept
is used. The SDM (Spatial Data Model) is created to act as
the common data model based on analyzing the activities
and workgroups. Spatial analysis for the decomposed
workgroups within common processes is proved to be more
manageable and scalable than relying on common elements
in the development of the domain spatial data model. The
obtained spatial model is dynamic and robust.
