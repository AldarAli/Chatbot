Abstract—A phobia is an overwhelming and exaggerated fear 
of an object, animal, place, situation, or feeling. Often, people 
with phobias ignore their symptoms and do not get 
psychotherapy treatment, either because of the social 
perspective about people who visit psychologists or simply 
because they cannot afford the cost of psychotherapy. This 
research paper proposes a mobile application named 
FaceYourFear (FyF) integrating Virtual Reality (VR) to help 
any user to live a cybernetic experience (where the outcomes of 
a session level can help the patient to move to the next level of 
treatment), overcome the illness, know about phobia symptoms 
and get extra information on types of phobias. 
Keywords- Phobia; Technology; Virtual Reality; Android 
app; Face Your Fear (FyF). 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Phobia comes from the Greek word Phobos and it is 
defined as an “exaggerated usually inexplicable and illogical 
huge fear of a particular object” [1] like cats, insects or 
crowded places. It is a type of anxiety disorder that can affect 
people’s daily life and, in some cases, it can lead to 
depression. Phobias are part of anxiety mental disorders and 
cause intense fear of specific objects, situations or some 
types of activities [2]. Having phobia is much more serious 
than a normal logical fear, that is, a specific part of the brain 
has been found to be responsible for some kinds of phobias 
[3]. Phobias are categorized as specific (simple), social or 
agoraphobia (complex). Social phobia regards the fear of 
participating in certain activities in public like eating or 
speaking. People suffering from social phobia tend to avoid 
any social events such as weddings or parties, which affects 
their social lives and increases their chance to develop 
depression due to their isolated lifestyle. 
VR is a computer-generated simulation where people 
experience the present. It has been developed with the aim to 
allow users to handle data with ease by offering an active 
and dynamic way to perceive and experience fake data. VR 
is quite intuitive, interactive and it is quick in replying to the 
user’s requests [4]. It has gained a great interest in its 
application in several fields, including the automotive 
industry, entertainment, healthcare, architecture, education 
and military training. 
The extent of VR immersion identifies how much a user 
is involved with the environment. It can also be regarded as 
how powerful the user attention is focused on the current 
task or situation. The immersion presence in the context of 
VR is the perception of being physically present in a non-
physical world. It is commonly based on several parameters 
such as interaction level, image quality, stereoscopic view 
and the rate update of the display. VR systems can be 
classified as (a) non-immersive systems, with limited 
implementation of VR techniques, (b) semi- immersive 
systems, with high quality graphics in association  
with large displays and (c) fully immersive systems, which 
provide the most effective and real virtual experience to 
users, but require the usage of a head-mounted display [5]. 
Smartphones are becoming an integral part of our lives. 
They possess high computing capabilities, are equipped with 
a variety of sensors, Internet connectivity, high resolution 
and touch screen, which have led to the development of a 
tremendous number of smartphone applications in several 
areas. Recently, VR glasses have been designed for 
smartphones, where the phone’s display is viewed as VR 
content. 
Museums offer technological and digital options to 
enrich the user experience in a visit. However, questions 
arise like which exhibition/museum could I visit? How to 
tour it and get the best experience? A hybrid approach to 
make recommendations for museum visits is proposed by 
[6], including Internet of Things architecture of beacons, data 
mining and machine learning. The result is a customized tour 
with 
augmented 
reality 
that 
contains 
a 
set 
of 
recommendations on how to visit a set of museums and 
obtain a better experience of the visit; the prototype is 
available in Google Play and it is named “Historic Center”. 
The research on VR in education is still in an early stage.  
Khan et al. [7] measured the impact of VR mobile apps on 
the learning motivation of undergraduate health science 
students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. 
According to the authors, the Attention, Relevance, 
Confidence and Satisfaction (ARCS) model guided the 
understanding of the impact of VR on student motivation 
where differences in student learning motivation before and 
after using VR apps were conducted (78 participants). Their

results showed that using VR apps increased the learning 
motivation of students in all ARCS dimensions. 
Taking full advantage of this current technology, the 
present research proposes a system that integrates the 
smartphone and the VR technologies for phobia treatment. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
discusses related work while Section III presents the 
proposed FaceYourFear (FyF) App in terms of architecture 
and features. Finally, Section IV concludes this paper with 
future perspectives.

STATE OF THE ART 
Previsl [8] is a Spanish company that develops and sells 
VR software. It offers VR Environments for airplanes, 
elevators 
(closed 
spaces 
and 
height 
phobia) 
and 
thunderstorms in 13 countries. It provides preparatory flight 
travel VR scenes such as packing of traveling bags, sitting in 
terminal and announcements of flights to make the person 
more comfortable with the environment and anticipate and 
prepare him/her for the upcoming event. It offers a 
computer-based VR therapy which is expensive. 
CleVR [9] was established in 2010 in the Netherlands 
with the aim to offer VR environments for various domains. 
They provide software for VR Exposure Therapy (VRET) in 
association with Delft University of Technology. The 
software is being used to treat flying and social phobia. The 
patients can experience the virtual environment with the help 
of Head-Mounted Displays (HDMs) and observe the entire 
environment all around them.  Meanwhile, psychotherapists 
have full control on changing the environment by increasing 
or decreasing the complexity level. 
Spider-World [10] is a computer-based VR therapy with 
an additional ability feature to feel the object. As the name 
suggests, it is used to treat patients with spider phobia. Under 
this treatment, the patient can touch a virtual spider with the 
help of a cyber hand, generating the illusion of a spider 
touch. Certainly, this type of tactile augmentation doubled 
the effectiveness of VR treatment by improving the patient 
confidence level towards the phobic stimulus. 
Phobos is VR software developed by PsyTech LLC [11]. 
It was specially designed to treat phobic patients using a 
gradual approach. The software is based on VR Exposure 
Therapy (VRET). It provides private environments for the 
patients to manage their anxiety symptoms, including 
interactive VR environments of some phobias such as flying, 
height, spiders and crowded spaces. 
The VR medical center [12] was established in the USA 
with the purpose of treating phobic patients in the most 
suitable, affordable, and convenient way. The medical center 
has the VR equipment and the required software to make the 
treatment possible. The center currently treats a number of 
phobias, including fear of flying, driving, public speaking 
and thunderstorms. The medical center uses the Cave 
Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and HDM setups to 
treat patients.  
In addition, numerous mobile applications have been 
developed under this context. Beat Social Phobia [13] was 
developed by Andrew Johnson, a clinical hypnotherapist, 
and released by HiveBrain Software in 2013. It is an app that 
provides audio instructions from the psychotherapist to think 
in a more positive way. It helps to identify the specific 
phobia, its symptoms and how to deal with it. It helps to 
become more confident, relaxed and calm in social places. 
The Beat Social Phobia app sessions are twenty-six minutes 
long and divided into four parts: introduction, relaxation, 
social phobia and awakening. However, it does not provide 
any video tutorials or immersive environments for the phobic 
patient. Thus, the patient cannot experience the actual 
situation causing the phobia (virtually). 
Byten Phobia Treatment [14] was developed by Paul 
Mckenna in 2013 and released by Once Byten Limited. It 
runs on iOS and provides an audio session. The patient can 
select one of the phobias from the list, listen to the sessions 
at their own pace and try to think in a different manner 
towards the phobic agent. This app has some weaknesses 
such as it does not offer videos or exposure therapy 
environment for agents which does not help the real 
experience of the phobia itself. The option to reverse the 
audio session to a specific point is not offered, so the user 
has to listen to the whole session again. Quite often, the app 
freezes and does not response at all. 
Cure Phobias and Overcome Fear [15] is an Android app 
developed in 2009. It is offered by MasterMind Apps and 
also provides an audio session of therapy that is meant to 
promote positive thinking in users to overcome their 
personal problems. It gives a textual description of the 
phobias and provides tips to overcome them. It contains 
some flaws such as unfriendly user interface and the audio 
session is quite long, causing loss of attention. Sometimes, 
the audio does not play at all and, occasionally, becomes 
unresponsive. 
Arachnophobia Free app [16] has been developed in 
association with two leading psychiatrists to treat people 
with spider phobia. It is offered by Thrive Technologies 
Limited. The app is supported by iOS and it is based on 
VRET where patients are exposed to spiders in a gradual 
manner. In early stages, the spider is represented as a little 
cute pink character named “Itsy” and, as the game 
progresses, it turns to a real looking spider. The user can 
retake the session to get over their fear. The app provides 
guided therapy with the help of a virtual doctor called 
Dr.  Freeman. The app presented in [17] is of high quality 
and has been winner of Cambridge University Technology 
and Enterprise Club (CUTEC) at Cambridge University. 
However, its drawback is that it treats a single type of 
phobia. 
Created by Malmum Developers, VR Height Phobia 
addresses height phobia [18]. It has three levels, and the 
users may easily navigate through them and may repeat any 
level until they become comfortable. However, it has poor 
graphics, and the user has to launch the app again after 
completing each level. 
Developed by Virtual Speech, the goal of the Public 
Speaking VR [19] app is public speaking phobia treatment. 
The scenes are provided with many people seated and some 
distractions are created with noise and voice of people 
talking. This helps the app user to boost his/her self-
assurance to face the real settings confidently. Some of the 
2

setbacks include blurred transitions while, sometimes, the 
splitting screen does not work. 
Our contribution in this field is a mobile application that 
assists patients with exposure therapy sessions at any time 
with ease and lets them face their own fear. It is designed to 
provide an affordable therapy instead of costly treatments 
and to avoid long waiting hours for appointments. Since the 
environment is controlled and gradual, the users can repeat 
the sessions at their own will. There are several levels of 
treatment that the patient might be gradually exposed to. As 
the patient becomes more comfortable, s/he can move to a 
more intense level. Furthermore, patients can learn about the 
different types of phobias and their respective symptoms 
through the application. In addition, the application assists 
the user to search for a psychotherapist in the selected 
location (UAE in our case) and to make an appointment. 
Finally, it is worth mentioning that our application can run 
on iOS and Android platforms. 
III. 
FYF APP 
A. Pre-Survey 
To develop a fully functional and good quality VR 
mobile app that helps with the treatment of phobias, a survey 
was conducted among people of different ages, genders, and 
professions. The data collected provided a quantitative 
insight into phobia related questions. In addition, the 
obtained feedback from Survey Monkey helped in the 
elicitation of requirements and features to be considered 
when developing the app. 
The gender participation ratio was 64% females and 36% 
males. The age distribution was as follows: 70% in the range 
of 18-24 years, 13.5% in the range of 25-34 years, 10% in 
the range of 35-44 years and 6.5% in the range 45-54 years. 
Of the 77 respondents, 72.73% live in the UAE while the 
remaining ones live outside of the UAE (Palestine, Syria, 
Turkey, KSA, Germany, Egypt). The main purpose of 
knowing the respondent’s location is closely related to some 
countries phobias patterns. This happens because phobias are 
frequently based on each local environment factor. 
Participants were given a phobia list and were asked to 
select the one(s) they suffer from. The results were as 
follows: 4.22% - arachnophobia; 8.42% - claustrophobia; 
6.85% - glossophobia; 13.51% - aquaphobia; 11.81% - 
acrophobia; 12.43% - achluophobia; 6.85% - avidophobia; 
8.56% - entomophobia; 4.43% - hemophobia; 9.59% - 
ailurophobia; 13.33% - other responses included war, 
fighting, sexual assault, my wife, snakes, cockroaches or not 
having phobia at all. 
Another inquiry was closely related to whether the 
participants’ phobia was related to a specific event. 84.42% 
of them simply stated no. Furthermore, to help understand 
the symptoms that occur when a person encounters the 
phobic agent, the most common symptom (50%) was rapid 
heartbeat. Some respondents specified other side-effects such 
as trouble breathing, panic attacks, shaking, nausea, running 
away and sweating. 
For those who have phobia, 54.67% of the respondents 
stated that they searched already for a specialist. Concerning 
the preference of way of treatment, 17.14% favor treatment 
with pills while 82.86% prefer treatment by exposure to the 
feared object/situation. The last question was related to the 
adoption of a mobile application for phobia treatment. 
63.51% were positive towards this idea. 
B. Development 
The FyF App consists of a three-layer framework 
composed of the presentation, business and data layers. The 
presentation layer contains the user interfaces which 
represent the scenes and was developed in Unity. The 
business is a service layer that contains Java (JS) and C# 
scripts to interact with the data layer for processing purpose 
and to display the scenes and give the appropriate feedback 
to the end-users. 
This VR-based phobia app runs on Android OS for smart 
phones. It also requires the use of VR glasses, such as 
Google Cardboard [20], which come in an affordable cost 
and in order to experience the phobia environment. The users 
of the app are phobic patients and the psychotherapist. The 
patient is the one who experiences phobia environments. 
S/he has the option to search for a nearby psychotherapist 
and to send the experience feedback from the app to the 
psychotherapist. For the psychotherapist, s/he may use the 
app to receive the patient experience outcome and to 
discuss/follow up with the patient. 
In its development, several software packages have been 
used to create realistic and high-quality scenes, including 
animations and audios to provide a realistic and natural 
experience for the end-user. The game engine choice was 
Unity3D [21] with its nice feature of multiple OS platforms. 
In a reference note, Unity is a game engine that supports 
simulations, desktop, websites and apps, including a 
Software Development Kit (SDK) for virtual and augmented 
reality. Google SketchUp [22], a powerful and user-friendly 
Computer Aided Design (CAD) created realistic effects. 
Max 3D [23], used to develop 3D animations, models and 
characters, provided realistic and professional graphics and it 
has been used to develop some extra VR environment 
features. Audacity audio editor provided multiple features of 
music editing and merging recording sounds. It was used to 
develop sound effects of water waves and darkness sound at 
night for the aquaphobia and achluophobia environments. 
Blender Software has been used to create 3D models and 
developing characters, videos and audios. It offers 
animations and high-quality graphics. Besides, it also 
supports natural environment and object creation such as 
raindrops, flames, smoke, rainbows and sky movements. 
Cardboard SDK, a VR based support compatible with Unity 
to develop VR applications, has been also exploited to 
develop immersive environments. 
In the phase of system analysis and requirement 
elicitation, meetings and interviews have been conducted 
with a psychotherapist in Abu Dhabi. In addition, a thorough 
literature search has been done to get an insight into the 
existing methods of phobia treatment.

C. GUIs 
A set of interfaces has been designed by considering the 
usability and user experience, where the displaying menus 
and functions are clear, the navigation is easy, the colors are 
well-chosen, the images are clear, and the text font size is 
suitable. Figure 1 (left) presents the screen when the user 
first launches this app (it stays for 5 seconds) while Figure 1 
(right) presents the main screen with three options: 
“Experience VR”, “Get to Know Phobia”, and “Nearby 
psychotherapist”. It was designed as a wheel with graphical 
icons for each selection. 
 
Figure 1.  Welcome (left) and main (right) screen. 
The “Experience VR” screen (Figure 2) gives the user 
two options to select: (A) Water phobia (aquaphobia); (B) 
Darkness phobia (achluophobia). Afterwards, s/he will be 
directed to the “Session” screen. For any new VR user, it is 
advisable that s/he chooses a short session first although real 
treatment requires long ones (30 minutes, according to 
doctors). Additionally, the session level time is setup 
automatically. The scenes for the three levels of aquaphobia 
and achluophobia are revealed in Figures 3 and 4, 
respectively. 
 
Figure 2.  “Experience VR” (left) and “Session” (right) screen. 
 
Figure 3.  Aquaphobia level 1 (top), level 2 (middle) and level 3 (bottom). 
 
Figure 4.  Achluophobia (a) level 1, (b) level 2 and (c) level 3. 
The “Nearby psychiatrist” helps the user to find the 
nearest psychotherapist, as shown in Figure 5. For that, the 
user selects the city from the list box menu. Once the city is 
selected, another sub-menu listing all hospitals that have a 
psychiatry department is shown to the user. For usability 
purposes, we opted for list boxes to make it easier rather than 
typing the name of the city and hospitals and, naturally, to 
reduce user typos. When a hospital is selected, the address 
and telephone numbers are disclosed. 
Our proposed app, FyF, has been tested from the 
functionalities and usability perspectives. A group of 
students from the university in Abu Dhabi have been 
selected to test our app. The selected participants suffer from 
the above-mentioned types of phobias. The overall results 
have shown to be promising. However, this testing phase 
requires long time and, more importantly, requires the 
opinions of psychotherapists in the field, which is our next 
step in the plan.

IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a VR-based mobile app is proposed to 
assist phobic patients. It has an easy-to-use interface to be 
used for the initial treatment. It provides patients with 
appealing features, such as virtual exposure to the phobic 
situations or objects, textual descriptions on types of phobias, 
their symptoms and treatments, search function for nearby 
psychotherapists, audio that helps them to relax and report 
submissions capabilities to his/her doctor. This app also 
provides the virtual environment for patients to gradually get 
exposed to each stimulus to overcome their fear. Patients 
may experience a 360-degree view of the phobia agent 
environment along with sounds to provide a realistic scene. 
At last, users can turn on music when they feel 
uncomfortable or move to higher exposure levels. 
As future improvement, we plan to gather feedback from 
experts in the field such as psychotherapists in case our app 
needs improvements. Also, we plan to add the use of a 
smartwatch to be connected where, during any VR session, 
the user heart rate is being monitored.  In the case the heart 
rate becomes high, the user will be given an option to exit or 
play a calm audio. If the heart rate exceeds a certain rate 
(100 bpm for adults), the session will be closed 
automatically. Additionally, we plan to extend the app to add 
other types of phobias.
