Abstract—The rapidly increasing popularity of WiFi has
created unprecedented levels of congestion in the unlicensed
frequency bands, especially in densely populated urban areas.
This results mainly because of the uncoordinated operation and
the unmanaged interference between WiFi access points. In this
context, the main objective of this experiment is to assess the
beneﬁt of a coordinated management of radio resources in dense
WiFi networks for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, using
Radio Environment Maps (REM). This experiment has used the
w-iLab.t test environment and the portable test-bed provided by
iMINDS for indoor scenarios. It was shown that REMs can detect
the presence of interfering links on the network (co-channel
or adjacent channel interference), and a suitable coordination
strategy can use this information to reconﬁgure Access Points
(AP) channel assignment and re-establish the client connection.
The coordination strategy almost double the capacity of a WiFi
link under strong co–channel interference, from 6.8 Mbps to
11.8 Mbps, increasing the aggregate throughput of the network
from 58.7 Mbps to 71.5 Mbps. However, this gain comes with
the cost of a relatively high-density network of spectrum sensors,
increasing the cost of deployment. The technique of AP hand-
off was tested to balance the load form one AP to another,
although the aggregate throughput is lower after load balancing.
REMs are also capable of detecting coverage holes on the
network, and a suitable Radio Resource Management strategy
use this information to reconﬁgure the APs transmit power to re-
establish the client connection and increase the throughput of the
overloaded AP, at a cost of diminishing the aggregate throughput
of the network. The insights coming out from this experiment
helped to understand the opportunities and limitations of WiFi
coordination strategies in realistic scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION
During the last ﬁfteen years, the WiFi technology, as a
last mile access to Internet, has experienced global explo-
sion. Nowadays, the WiFi networks carry more trafﬁc to
and from end-user’s terminals (PCs, tablets, and smartphones)
than Ethernet and cellular networks combined. The success
of this technology is owed to its introduction in unlicensed
spectrum (ISM bands), which has furthermore allowed un-
precedented innovation in the wireless technology. However,
as the penetration of WiFi continues, the unlicensed bands are
becoming overcrowded. Unpredictable user-deployed hot spots
(smartphone) are a new source of interference and instability
that can undermine the network performance. Moreover, many
Internet of Things (IoT) devices also share the unlicensed
spectrum with WiFi, which further increases the problem scale.
In fact, interference is a limit factor of WiFi densiﬁcation;
this is a result mainly because of the uncoordinated operation
and the unmanaged interference between the WiFi Access
Points (AP). In WiFi, each Access Point can only access lo-
cally available sensing information within single cell coverage.
It cannot access global knowledge on a multi-AP network and
the deployment environment, leading to a sub-optimal network
conﬁguration.
In this context, the design of the WiFi networks is complex
because of the high-density of users and signiﬁcant variability
of capacity requirements that can be strongly dependent on
location and time. The variability of the capacity demand can
be faced by deploying a dynamic network infrastructure, in
which WiFi access points can be switched on and off, can
work on different bands, and can tune their coverage range
from the network status and QoS requirements.
This paper is organized in ﬁve sections. After the intro-
duction, the second section describes the background and the
motivation of the work. In Section III, we describe the test-
beds and deﬁne the setup environment of the experiments. The
fourth section presents the experimental results with different
measurements and scenarios. Conclusions and future work are
drawn in Section V.
II. BACKGROUND
Recently, we conducted a set of experiments in a pseudo-
shielded WiFi test-bed, to assess and verify the beneﬁt of
a coordinated approach for interference management in
dense WiFi networks on the 2.4 GHz ISM band, which
make use of realistic Radio Environment Maps (REM) [1].
Other research work also supports that the REM of the
target coverage area is an important input for interference

management and coordination strategies [2]; Other studies
have recently demonstrated the potential economic value
of WiFi coordination in dense indoor experiments [3] or
proposed a secured framework to achieve optimal RRM in
residential networks, using distributed channel assignment
algorithm [4]. Thus, the use of efﬁcient of Radio Resource
Management (RRM) strategies, supported by REMs, have
emerged as a valid combination to optimize spectrum usage
[5].

Radio

(RRM)
algorithms can use REMs to optimize the overall network
performance.
In [1], we experimentally veriﬁed that a coordinated
approach of the RRM of channel frequency and power,
combined with the use of REMs, can increase the performance
of WiFi networks in dense deployment scenarios. To extend
this study further, the main objective of this experiment is to
assess the beneﬁt of a coordinated approach in dense WiFi
networks also in the 5 GHz ISM band, using realistic Radio
Environment Maps and an implementation-oriented approach
in two wireless environments: the pseudo-shielded test-bed
w-iLab.t, and a common ofﬁce building. Besides interference
management, we will also verify the potential of REMs
for load balancing and hole detection in WiFi networks.
An important performance metric is the gain in terms of
average throughput, comparing the coordinated approaches
with the legacy uncoordinated approach. We are interested
in measuring the average capacity gain, when using market
available and low-cost spectrum sensors in very dense indoor
scenarios. The results of this experiment are very useful from
a business perspective and industrial research, to realize if
the actual coordination gain is sufﬁcient enough to justify
the investment in the sensing and the signaling infrastructure
needed to implement a WiFi coordination scheme in realistic
scenarios [6].
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND ARCHITECTURE
This section deﬁnes and describes in detail the setup envi-
ronment. The experiments were divided in two distinct phases:
• Phase 1: Assessment of WiFi coordination in dense
indoor scenario using the w-iLab.t test-bed, at 2.4 GHz.
• Phase 2: Assessment of WiFi coordination in dense
indoor scenario (two ﬂoor building) using a portable test-
bed, at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
For each of the two phases, we ran several experiments:
• Intra-network co-channel interference;
• Intra-network adjacent-channel interference;
• Non-overlapping (optimal) channels assignment;
• Channel reallocation triggered by external interferences;
• Load balancing;
• Hole detection.
Fig. 1. Generic Setup diagram for the experiment.
A. Setup architecture
The setup diagram of the demonstrator, depicted in Figure 1,
encompasses four major components, as brieﬂy explained in
the following:
• A network of spectrum sensors (energy detectors) that
report spectrum measurements to a database.
• A REM builder module that computes the radio envi-
ronmental maps based on measurements stored in the
spectrum database, the positions/conﬁgurations of radio
transmitters (AP), indoor propagation models and spatial
interpolation algorithms.
• The RRM that optimizes the overall WiFi network in
terms of channel and power allocation based on the REM.
• WiFi APs that receive the conﬁguration settings and
reports performance metrics to the RRM module.
B. Test-bed and resources allocation
Besides the available WiFi hardware, both portable and
w-iLab.t test-bed offers several software tools to setup, control
and gather radio measurements. We used the java-based frame-
work jFed [7] to conﬁgure the test-bed nodes. jFed is also used
to activate nodes, install the Operating System, and SSH into
the nodes. OMF6 [8] controls all the experiments, using scripts
written with OMF Experiment Description Language (OEDL)
[9], which is based on the Ruby programming language. The
experiment description with OMF6 is structured in two main
steps:
1) First, we declare the resources to be used in the experi-
ment, such as applications, nodes, and related conﬁgu-
rations, such as Wi-Fi channels and transmitted power;
2) In the second step, we deﬁne the events that triggers the
experiment’s execution, and the tasks to be executed.
The Iperf trafﬁc generator tool [10] generates data for each
link using a client – server conﬁguration. All links parameters
are recorded during 100 s for all experiments. This ensures
that the radio signals for the links under test are on the air
and stable. The measurements data are extracted during the

experiment using OML [11]. OML is a stand-alone tool that
parses and reports all the measurements to a database (SQLite3
or PostgreSQL) installed on the experiment controller server
of the test-bed.
1) Phase 1 – w-iLab.t test-bed: All experiments took place
in a shielded environment in the w-iLab.t test-bed (Ghent
– Belgium), a cognitive-radio test-bed for remote experi-
mentation [12]. The nodes are installed in an open room
(66 m by 21 m) in a grid conﬁguration. Figure 2 shows
the testing area and the locations of the nodes, represented
by black numbered circles. Each node has one embedded
PC (ZOTAC) with two wireless IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n cards
(Spartklan WPEA–110N/E/11n), a spectrum sensor (Wi-Spy
USB spectrum analyzer), one Gigabit LAN, and a Bluetooth
USB 2.0 Interface and a ZigBee sensor node [13].
We have selected 5 equidistant links in a client – server
conﬁguration, represented by a black arrow in Figure 2. The
distance between adjacent links is 12 m, and for each link, the
distance between the client node and the AP node is 3.6 m.
The red arrow represents the interfering link, with a separation
of 12.5 m between nodes.
2) Phase 2 – Portable test-bed: The second phase of the
experiment took place on a building at the School of Techno-
logy – Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco. The building is
60 m by 25 m wide. The building is divided in two ﬂoors, as
depicted in Figure 3(a) (Floor 0) and Figure 3(b) (Floor 1). The
walls are 20 cm thick and built with clay bricks and concrete,
and the separation ﬂoor is made of 50 cm thick reinforced
concrete. A staircase give access to both ﬂoors as depicted on
the bottom left corner of both ﬁgures. Each WiFi node has
one Intel NUC Embedded PC (NUC), with a wireless IEEE
802.11 a/b/g/n Qualcomm Atheros AR928X (PCI-Express), a
spectrum sensor (Wi-Spy USB spectrum analyzer) and one
Gigabit LAN interface.
Two radio links were installed on Floor 0:
• Link 2 connects NUC8 (client) and NUC7 (AP). The
nodes are located next to the ceiling of a corridor,
with Line of Sight (LOS) condition between nodes (Fi-
gure 3(a)). The distance between nodes is 8.5 m.
• Link 3 connects NUC6 (client) and NUC3 (AP). As
already explained before, NUC6 is located on Floor 0,
below NUC3. The dashed line from NUC3 and NUC6 re-
present the best propagation path between nodes, through
the staircase between Floor 0 and Floor 1. The distance
between NUC7 and NUC6 is 13.4 m.
Three radio links were installed on Floor 1:
• Link 4 connects NUC1 (client) and NUC2 (AP). The
nodes are located on separated rooms with no Line of
Sight (NLOS) between nodes (Figure 3(b)). The distance
between nodes is 9.6 m.
• Link 1 connects NUC5 (client) and NUC4 (AP). The
nodes are located on a corridor with LOS between nodes
(Figure 3(b)). The distance between nodes is 9.5 m.
• Link 3 connects NUC6 (client) and NUC3 (AP). NUC6
is located on Floor 0, below NUC3. The dashed line from
NUC3 and NUC6 represent the best propagation path
between nodes, through the staircase between Floor 0 and
Floor 1.
The distance between NUC2 and NUC3 is 12 m.
C. Radio Environment Map builder
The REM is a dataset of spectrum occupancy computed
based on raw spectrum measurements, propagation modeling
and spatial interpolation algorithms.
There are several methods to compute REMs available
on the literature, with different interpolation approaches and
based on space and time spectrum measurements. One of
the most commonly used methods is the Inverse Distance
Weighted Interpolation (IDW) [6]. Despite the ”bull’s eyes”
effect, this method is relatively fast and efﬁcient, and presents
good properties for smoothing REM. To decrease the sensitive-
ness to outlier measurements, we have implemented a modiﬁed
version of IDW method, which calculates the interpolated
values using only the nearest neighbor’s points.
To compute the REM, the exact position of each radio node
on the w-iLab.t test-bed area is deﬁned as shown in Figure 2.
REMs are computed using Matlab to facilitate the integration
with the RRM algorithms, also implemented in Matlab.
D. RRM coordinating strategies
The RRM optimizes the overall WiFi network conﬁguration
in terms of channel, and power allocation based on the infor-
mation provided by the REM. The adopted RRM strategies
during the experiments are the following [2]:
• Strategy 1: Allocate the WiFi links to disjoint, non-
overlapping bands and use minimum possible transmit
power for each WiFi link;
• Strategy 2: Optimize the transmit power of multiple WiFi
links, when interference is detected.
IV. MEASUREMENTS
After describing the setup architecture and the test-bed
resources, we will explain the experimental measurement
campaigns. Each set of measurement aims at studying the
inﬂuence of measurable interference characteristics on the
throughput of the WiFi network under study. The process was
structured in four steps:
1) Spectrum measurements from the spectrum sensors in
all WiFi frequency channels;
2) Compute the REMs based on spectrum measurements
and IDW algorithm;
3) Measure and record the throughput of the radio links;
4) Apply the coordination strategy, e.g., reconﬁgure the
channel allocation or the transmitted power of each APs.

A. Phase 1 – w-iLab.t test-bed
1) Estimation of the path-loss propagation model: Having
a suitable propagation model is a key element to build good
REMs, therefore before running the experiments, we have
measured the path loss between the clients and the APs in the
w-iLab.t test environment to estimate the propagation model
parameters. Since most of the nodes are in Line–of–Sight
(LoS) and relatively closed to each other, as shown in Figure 2,
we have considered a Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) model:
L = n (10log10 (d) + 10log10 (f)) + 32.45 (dB)
(1)
Where L is the path loss in dB, d is the distance in meters,
f is the frequency in GHz and n is the path loss exponent,
which is 2 in the FSPL model. The path-loss measurement
process was implemented as follows:
1) Setup one node as an AP with 5 dBm transmit power
(PT x) on WiFi Channel 1 (f = 2.412 GHz), and all the
other nodes as clients.
2) For each client:
• Measure the Received Signal Strength Indication
(RSSI) of the AP, denoted as PRx.
• Measure the distance d between the client and the
AP.
3) Setup a different node as AP and the remaining nodes
as clients.
4) Repeat steps 1), 2) and 3).
The blue dots on Figure 4 represent the results of the
measurement campaign.
Considering Friis transmission equation, L = PT x (dBm)−
PRx (dBm), combined with (1), we compute an estimate of
the path loss exponent n [14],

curve (red line).

(2)
Using (2) with the Fitting Toolbox provided by Matlab
and the measured RSSI (PRx), the value of n was found to
be 2.097, with a 95% conﬁdence bounds [2.084, 2.109]. This
experimentally determined value corresponds to what we are
expecting for a LoS scenario. The red curve in Figure 4 shows
the result of the ﬁtting process.
Appropriate AP power levels are essential to maintaining
a coverage area, not only to ensure correct (not maximum)
amount of power covering an area, but also to ensure that
excessive power is not used, which would add unnecessary
interference to the radiating area. Transmitted power can be
minimized to reduce interference among the APs.
Considering a typical baseline signal strength of -65 dBm
for the WiFi received signals coming from adjacent cells, using
(1) and n = 2.097, we have computed the optimal transmit
power as a function of the distance, as depicted in Figure 5.
This study is important to setup the initial APs transmit power
to ensure a suitable cell coverage. Considering that 12 m is
the separation between adjacent WiFi cells in the experiment
set-up (Figure 2), the APs transmit power are set at 0 dBm,
unless otherwise noted in the following experiments.
2) Experiment 1 – Assessment of the channel distribution
inﬂuence on the throughput: The aim of this experiment is to
assess the inﬂuence of channel distribution on the throughput,
and verify the worst-case reference scenario in terms of intra–
network co-channel interference, e.g., when all APs assigned
to the same channel ( Channel 1 – 2.412 GHz).
Fig. 5. Transmit power as a function of the distance, for -65 dBm received
power baseline.
The average values of the measured throughput for each link
and the aggregated throughput of the WiFi network are shown
in Table I. As expected, the low values of link’s throughput
are due to the strong co-channel interference that limits the
overall performance of the network. Note that this is a worst-
case reference scenario in terms of co-channel interference.

3) Experiment 2 – Considering non-overlapping channels
assignment: With this experiment, all APs are conﬁgured with
non-overlapping channels: Channel 1 (2.412 GHz), Channel 6
(2.437 GHz) and Channel 11 (2.462 GHz). The measured
throughput presented in Table II clearly shows the advantage
of using non-overlapping channels in the WiFi planning. With
a transmitted power set to 0 dBm on each APs, the measured
aggregated throughput is 71.50 Mbps, i.e., more than three
times higher than the value in Experiment 1 (22.34 Mbps).
However, if the transmitted power PT x is increased to 5 dBm,
the aggregate throughput decreases to 66.05 Mbps, because
of the higher co-channel interference between Link 1 and
Link 4, and between Link 2 and Link 5. Note that according
to [1], with 5 dBm, the APs have 22 m coverage radius. This
channel conﬁguration is the baseline scenario for the following
measurements of Phase 1.

channel interference: The setup for Experiment 3 has the same

non-overlapping channels allocation as in Experiment 2, with
an additional interference Link active at Channel 11, placed
next to Link 2, as depicted in Figure 2. Three different inter-
ference power levels (PI) were applied during the experiment
{0, 7, 15} (dBm). The computed REMs at Channel 11 for
different interference link’s power are shown in Figure 6(a).
The color gradient represents the computed power in dBm
for a channel at location (x, y). The location of the nodes is
added as an additional layer (black circles). The yellow dots
are due the ”bull’s eye” effect typical of the IDW interpolation
algorithm and should be discarded. By observing the REMs,
we can detect not only Link 2 and Link 5, but also the extra
radio activity coming from the interfering link. Note that the
detection of this interfering link will trigger the coordination
strategy in the WiFi network.
The results from Table III show an overall network through-
put decrease, compared with the results from Experiment 2,
mainly due to the interference from the interfering link on
Link 2 and Link 5. However, the results indicate that the
variation on the power level of the interferer does not have
a strong impact on the aggregate throughput.
From the REM information, the coordination strategy re-
allocates the WiFi channels among the APs, to avoid strong
co-channel interference. The REM for Channel 11, depicted
in Figure 6(b), shows a clear spatial separation between the
interference source and Link 4.

Table III shows a signiﬁcant throughput increase from
58 Mbps to 71 Mbps thanks to the coordination strategy. The
aggregate throughput is now close to the values obtained with
Experiment 2, i.e., without any interference Link. Once again,
the results indicate that the variation on the power level of
the interferer does not have a strong impact on the aggregated
throughput.
5) Experiment 4 – Channel reallocation triggered by adja-
cent channel interference: With this experiment, we want to
understand how the WiFi network is affected by strong adja-
cent channel interference and how effective is the coordination
strategy under such circumstances. The interfering link is set
to operate on Channel 10, while Link 2 uses Channel 11. In the
case of adjacent channel interference, the REM generated for
channel X must take into account the power received from
adjacent channels X ± n ∈ N, weighted according to the
spectral mask of the ﬁlter present at the WiFi receiver [15]. The
weighting factors of the transmit mask are listed in Table IV
and represented in Figure 7. Note that each WiFi channel is
22 MHz wide, but the channel separation is only 5 MHz. As
an example, the power of the 4th adjacent-channel should be
reduced by 28 dB to be correctly used in the computation of
the REM.
The results from Table V show an overall network through-
put decrease, compared with the results obtained from Ex-
periments 3 and 4. This result shows that the ﬁrst adjacent-
channel interference leads to a higher throughput degradation
than a co-channel interference (no–interference: 71.5 Mbps,
co–channel interference: 58.6 Mbps and adjacent–channel
interference: 56.7 Mbps). Once again, the results also indicate
that the variation on the power level of the interferer does not
have a strong impact on the aggregate throughput.
6) Experiment 5 – Automatic power control to overcome
co-channel interference: The aim of this experiment is to
understand if automatic power control is a good strategy to
overcome co-channel interference. The setup of the network
under test has ﬁve links using non-overlapping channels, with
an additional co–channel interference link in Channel 11. The
RRM strategy in this experiment keeps the same channel
assignment of each link and increases the power of the victim
link (Link 2). The transmitted power increases in steps of 5 dB,
from 0 to 15 dBm. The remaining APs of the network under
test remains at 0 dBm, and the interfering link is set to transmit
5 dBm in Channel 11. The measured throughput is listed in
Table VI.

The results suggest that, despite the increase of transmitted
power on Link 2, the overall throughput remains low and
approximately constant (roughly 58 Mbps), therefore, power
increase alone does not overcome the degradation caused by

strong co-channel interference. The WiFi coordination strategy
investigated in Experiment 3 is much more effective, leading
to an aggregated throughput of 71 Mbps.
B. Phase 2 – Portable test-bed
For the indoor propagation model used to create all REMs,
beside the relative position and distance between NUCs, we
also consider the following parameters on the algorithm:
• Wall penetration Losses: 5 dBm
• Floor penetration Losses 18 dBm
• Height of each ﬂoor: 5 m
All experiences were conducted for both 2.4 GHz and
5 GHz frequency bands.
1) Experiment 1 – Full co-channel interference: In this
ﬁrst experiment, all APs (NUC2, NUC3, NUC4 and NUC7)
are conﬁgured to transmit at Channel 6 (2.437 GHz). The
objective is to have a worst-case reference scenario in terms
of co-channel interference, and to verify the inﬂuence of walls
and ﬂoor on the overall performance of the network.
REMs are produced based on the measured RSSI on each
client and for each AP. Figure 8 represents the REM computed
for Experiment 1, taken at Channel 6 and 17 dBm transmit
power. The color gradient represents the computed power in

dBm for a channel at location (x, y). The location of the nodes
is added as an additional layer (black circles) along with the
corresponding link (black lines).
On the ﬁrst ﬂoor (Figure 8(b)), the uniform red color on
the REM is the evidence of a high-power level transmitted
at Channel 6. The walls between Link 4 and Link 3 or
Link 1 have little inﬂuence on the propagation of the signal,
and cannot avoid co-channel interference. On the other ﬂoor
(Figure 8(a)), the REM shows the position of the single AP
present on that ﬂoor (NUC7 - Link 2). The high color contrast
suggests that the inﬂuence of other APs located on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor is low, mainly caused by the presence of a thick ﬂoor.
The throughput for each link is computed at different
transmitted powers and frequency bands, and the aggregated
throughput results are presented in Figure 9 (solid lines). As
expected and from the analysis of the REMs, all links from
the ﬁrst ﬂoor (Link 1, 3 and 4) are strongly interfering with
each other. This effect is more visible when the transmitted
power is 17 dBm.
For lower transmit powers, in particular between 0 and
5 dBm, the clients are outside or on the edge of the coverage
area of the AP, which cause a low throughput. This is
particularly evident for Link 3, as shown in Table VII, with
a client on one ﬂoor and the AP on the other. This effect is
even more evident for the 5 GHz band measurements.
The only link that present good results in the single link lo-
cated on Floor 0 (Link 2). At 2.4 GHz, this link present higher
throughput values, but as the transmit power is increased the
throughput decreases due to co-channel interference with the
other links. At 5 GHz, where the coverage area is lower for
the same transmit power, better throughput results are attained
at any transmit power, exception made at 14 dBm, probably
due to bad measurement procedures.
2) Experiment 2 – Considering no-overlapping channels
assignment: On the second experiment, all APs (NUC2,
NUC3, NUC4 and NUC7) are conﬁgured with no-overlapping

channels and variable transmit power between 0 dBm and
17 dBm. Both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands are tested.
The results shown in Table VIII are consistent with the
strategy applied on this experiment, even for Link 3, with a
client on one ﬂoor and the AP on the other. The increase
of the aggregate throughput presented in Figure 9 (dashed
lines) reﬂects the advantage of a coordinated approach. As
an example, for the 2.4 GHz frequency band, and compared
with the previous Experiment 1, the aggregated throughput
has increased from 6.31 Mbps to 49.64 Mbps when transmit
power is 17 dBm. For the 5 GHz frequency band and the same
transmit power, the aggregated throughput has increased from
28.29 Mbps to 99.77 Mbps.
3) Experiment 3 – Channel reallocation triggered by co-
channel interference: Experiment 3 setup is a WiFi network
composed by three Links (Links 1, 2 and 3), with a channel
distribution following a no-overlapping strategy. Link 4 is used
as an external interferer with a constant transmit power of
17 dBm and set to the same frequency channel as Link 3. The
objective is to trigger the RRM algorithm to reconﬁgure the
channel distribution, based on REMs.
According the frequency band in use during each experi-
ment, the initial channel distribution is:
• Link 1: Channel 11 or Channel 44
• Link 2: Channel 1 or Channel 36
• Link 3: Channel 6 or Channel 40
• Link 4: Channel 6 or Channel 40 (Interferer)
As an example, from the RSSI measurement on each client,
the computed REM at Channel 6 is shown in Figure 10. By
observing the REMs on both ﬂoors, it is possible to detect not
only Link 3 activity on Channel 6, but also the extra radio
signal activity coming from the interfering Link 4.
Figure 11 (solid lines) shows the measured throughput for
each link at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz band, when the transmit
power of Links 1, 2 and 3 is swept form 0 dBm to 17 dBm.
The bold line presents the computed aggregate throughput of

the network.
As the transmit power increases, so does the aggregated
throughput of the network, to a maximum of 19.36 Mbps for
14 dBm (2.4 GHz band) and 67.04 Mbps for 8 dBm transmit
power (5 GHz band). As the transmit power increases further,
so does the overall co-channel interference of the network
mainly at Channel 6 (or 40), causing the throughput to drop.
As shown in Figure 10, the REM allows the detection of
the interfering link. With this information, and by setting an
appropriate threshold for the minimum throughput on each
link, the RRM strategy reallocates the WiFi channels among
the APs to avoid the strong co-channel interference. Thus, after
the RRM strategy is applied, the network channel reassignment
is as follow:
• Link 1: Channel 1 or Channel 36
• Link 2: Channel 6 or Channel 40
• Link 3: Channel 11 or Channel 44
• Link 4: Channel 6 or Channel 40 (Interferer)
After the RRM channel reassignment, throughput measure-
ments shown in Figure 11 have signiﬁcant increase from
19.36 Mbps to 46.9 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band, and from
67.94 Mbps to 79.97 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, thanks to
the RRM strategy based on REM. The aggregate throughput
is now close to the values obtained with Experiment 2, i.e.,
without any interference Link.
4) Experiment 4 – Hole detection: This experiment is
aimed at detecting coverage holes on the network, based
on REMs, and implement a RRM algorithm to increase the
transmit power of adjacent APs next to the clients with poor or
non-existent connection with their former AP. The initial setup
consists of 4 NUCs located on Floor 1, with the following
conﬁguration:
• NUC2: Access Point 3; Channel 6; 0 dBm transmit power
• NUC5: Access Point 2; Channel 1; 16 dBm transmit
power
• NUC4: Access Point 1; Channel 11; 13 dBm transmit
power
• NUC3: Client connected to Access Point 2; Channel 1;
17 dBm transmit power
After 100 s, Access Point 2 (Link 1) is disconnected and
the client loses connection and the corresponding throughput
drops to zero. The RRM algorithm implements a series of
actions to ensure that the client reconnects:
• Compute REM of the APs;
• Detect the absence of AP2 transmit signal on Channel 1;
• Increase the transmit power of adjacent Access Points
(AP1 and AP3) up to 16 dBm, so the client may discover
one or both APs, and connect to one of them.

Compared with the previous state, the RRM decision is to
increase the transmit power of adjacent AP1 (NUC4) and AP3
(NUC2) next to the client node with poor or non-existent
connection. This action gives to the former Link 1 client
the option to select and connect to the best AP available,
based on RSSI (AP3 – NUC2 in this experiment). Figure 12
shows the throughput evolution of the client node during the
experiment. Initially connected to Link 1, the mean throughput
was 1.7 Mbps. After losing connection with AP2, the new
connection with AP3 (Link 2) was set with a mean throughput
of 19.4 Mbps.
5) Experiment 5 – Characterization of the building ﬂoor as
a WiFi barrier: In this experiment, the objective is to verify
the potential of a building ﬂoor as an effective barrier between

WiFi Links in a co-channel scenario.
As depicted on Figure 13, the setup consists of two NUCs
conﬁgured as APs, using the same frequency channel (11 on
the 2.4 GHz band or 48 on the 5 GHz band), located on
different ﬂoor, but on the same vertical alignment. Each AP
has two clients connected to it. The ﬂoor is made of concrete,
50 cm thick.
From the measurement campaign at 2.4 GHz, the building
ﬂoor is not efﬁcient in blocking the radio signal from crossing
the concrete structure and interfering with the other WiFi link.
For Link 1, the power level of the AP located on Floor 0
suffers an attenuation of 10 dB when crossing to Floor 1. For
Link 2 AP, located on Floor 1, the signal has no attenuation,
when crossing from Floor 1 to Floor 0. However, at 5 GHz,
the building ﬂoor introduce 20 dB attenuation on both links,
when the radio signal crosses the building ﬂoor. However, the

signal level from Link 2 is more pronounced than the signal
from Link 1 on the other ﬂoor.
The aggregated throughput computed and represented on
Figure 14 shows that the building ﬂoor is not efﬁcient in
blocking the radio signal from crossing the concrete structure
and interfering with the other WiFi Link at 2.4 GHz. The
aggregate throughput decreases from 19.4 Mbps to 3.5 Mbps
as the transmit power increases, since co-channel interference
between Links becomes stronger. However, Link 2 presents
higher throughput, as the co-channel interference from Link 1
is lower.
At 5 GHz, the aggregate throughput increases from
16.7 Mbps to 24.6 Mbps as the transmit power increases,
which indicates that co-channel interference between links
has diminutive inﬂuence on the aggregated throughput. Thus,
the presence of concrete walls and ﬂoor can be used by the
coordination strategy to improve the channel distribution on
the 5 GHz band and increase the network capacity.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented the testing of WiFi coordination strate-
gies that exploits information from Radio Environment Maps,
based upon several exploratory measurement campaigns in a
pseudo-shielded test-bed environment and in a real environ-
ment using a portable test-bed. Several scenarios were tested:
Uncoordinated channels assignment, optimal coordination, in-
terference mitigation, automatic power control, hole detection
and load balancing.
The overall performance of the WiFi network depends on
a smart channel allocation. As an example, for the network
under test in the pseudo-shielded test-bed environment, we’ve
got an aggregated throughput of 22.3 Mbps in a full co-
channel interference scenario and 71.5 Mbps using a con-
ﬁguration of non-overlapping channels. It was shown that
based on the observation of REMs, it is possible to detect

a function of the AP transmit power.
the presence of interfering links (co-channel and ﬁrst adjacent
channel). First adjacent-channel interference leads to a higher
throughput degradation than a co-channel interference with
the same power level (no-interference: 71.5 Mbps, co-channel
interference: 58.6 Mbps and adjacent-channel interference:
56.7 Mbps). The coordination strategy that automatically
reallocates WiFi channels to avoid channel overlapping is
very beneﬁcial (e.g., the aggregated throughput goes from
58.7 Mbps to 71.5 Mbps, the link under interference goes
from 6.8 Mbps to 11.8 Mbps). However, in case of strong co-
channel interference, the strategy of automatically increase the
power level of the victim link, when keeping the same channel
allocation, does not bring any gain in terms of measured
throughput. With the portable test-bed in a real environment,
The RRM that automatically reallocates WiFi channels to
avoid channel overlapping from an external interferer is also

very beneﬁcial. At 5 GHz, the aggregated throughput goes
from 62 Mbps to 79.97 Mbps, the link under interference goes
from 3.15 Mbps to 20.7 Mbps.
Moreover, it was shown that a building’s concrete ﬂoor that
separates two WiFi networks using the same channel, act as an
effective barrier at 5 GHz, but not on the 2.4 GHz band. Thus,
the presence of concrete walls and ﬂoor can be used by the
coordination strategy to improve the channel distribution and
increase the network capacity. Increasing the transmit power
on the ﬁrst case (e.g., 5 GHz band) leads to a higher throughput
(from 16.71 Mbps to 24.62 Mbps), while for the second case
(e.g., 2.4 GHz band) decreases the aggregate throughput (from
19.36 Mbps to 3.54 Mbps).
For the RRM to be effective, several sensor nodes (energy
detectors) are needed to create a REM with enough spatial
resolution. The additional hardware required for spectrum
sensing, inter–cell signaling and REM building may increase
the investment by 50 %, when compared to an uncoordinated
WiFi network. However, by implementing a coordinated man-
agement of radio resources, the overall throughput in WiFi
network was increased more than 200 %, even in the presence
of interfering links.
The results coming out from this experiment may have
a clear impact in telecommunication companies and WiFi
service providers, helping to understand the opportunities
and limitations of WiFi coordination strategies in realistic
scenarios. We will use the insights form this experiment
in dense WiFi outdoor scenarios, to assess the beneﬁt of
a coordinate management of radio resources. In particular,
WiFi coordination in shopping malls, football stadiums or
swimming pool complexes are amongst the most challenging
locations to deploy a WiFi network because of the huge crowds
in close proximity to each other and the near universal use of
smartphones by today’s customers and sport fans.
