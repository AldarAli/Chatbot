Abstract—The 
importance 
of 
wireless 
communications, 
involving electronic devices, has been growing. Performance is 
a crucial issue, leading to more reliable and efficient 
communications. Security is equally important. Laboratory 
measurements were performed on several performance aspects 
of Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 a, g) WEP and WPA point-to-point 
links. Our study contributes to the performance evaluation of 
this technology, using available equipments (DAP-1522 access 
points from D-Link and WPC600N adapters from Linksys). 
New detailed results are presented and discussed, namely at 
OSI levels 4 and 7, from TCP, UDP and FTP experiments: 
TCP throughput, jitter, percentage datagram loss and FTP 
transfer rate. Comparisons are made to corresponding results 
obtained for, mainly, open links. Conclusions are drawn about 
the comparative performance of the links.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Contactless communication techniques have been 
developed using mainly electromagnetic waves in several 
frequency ranges, propagating in the air. Wireless fidelity 
(Wi-Fi) and free space optics (FSO), whose importance and 
utilization have been recognized and growing, are 
representative 
examples 
of 
wireless 
communications 
technologies. Wi-Fi is a microwave based technology 
providing for versatility, mobility and favourable prices. Wi-
Fi has been considerably expanding to complement the 
traditional wired networks. It has been used both in ad hoc 
mode and in infrastructure mode. In this case, a wireless 
local area network (WLAN), based on an access point (AP), 
permits Wi-Fi electronic devices to communicate with a 
wired based local area network (LAN) through a 
switch/router. At the personal home level, a wireless 
personal area network (WPAN) permits personal devices to 
communicate. Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 2.4 and 
5 GHz microwave links are used, with IEEE 802.11a, 
802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n standards [1]. Nominal 
transfer rates up to 11 (802.11b), 54 Mbps (802.11 a, g) and 
600 Mbps (802.11n) are specified. Carrier sense multiple 
access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is the medium 
access 
control. 
There 
are 
studies 
on 
wireless 
communications, 
wave 
propagation 
[2,3], 
practical 
implementations of WLANs [4], performance analysis of the 
effective transfer rate for 802.11b point-to-point links [5], 
802.11b performance in crowded indoor environments [6]. 
Performance has been a very important issue, resulting in 
more reliable and efficient communications. In comparison 
to traditional applications, new telematic applications are 
especially sensitive to performances. Requirements have 
been pointed out [7]. 
Wi-Fi security is very important. Microwave radio 
signals can be very easily captured as they travel through the 
air. Therefore, several security methods have been developed 
to provide authentication such as, by increasing order of 
security, wired equivalent privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi protected 
access (WPA) and Wi-Fi protected access II (WPA2). WEP 
was initially intended to provide confidentiality comparable 
to that of a traditional wired network. A shared key for data 
encryption is involved. The communicating devices use the 
same key to encrypt and decrypt radio signals. The cyclic 
redundancy check 32 (CRC32) checksum used in WEP does 
not provide a great protection. However, in spite of its 
weaknesses, 
WEP 
is 
still 
widely 
used 
in 
Wi-Fi 
communications for security reasons, mainly in point-to-
point links. WPA implements the majority of the IEEE 
802.11i standard [1]. It includes a message integrity code 
(MIC), replacing the CRC used in WEP. Either personal or 
enterprise modes can be used. In this latter case an 802.1x 
server is required. Both temporal key integrity protocol 
(TKIP) and advanced encryption standard (AES) cipher 
types are usable and a group key update time interval is 
specified. 
Several performance measurements have been made for 
2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi open [8-9], WEP [10], WPA links [11], 
as well as very high speed FSO [12]. It is important to 
investigate the effects of increasing levels of security 
encryption on link performance. Therefore, in the present 
work new Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 a, g) results arise, using 
personal mode WPA, through OSI levels 4 and 7. 
Performance is evaluated in laboratory measurements of 
WPA point-to-point links using new available equipments. 
Comparisons are made to corresponding results obtained for 
WEP and open links. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II 
describes the state of the art, the problem and the solution.

II. 
STATE OF THE ART, PROBLEM AND SOLUTION 
In prior and actual state of the art, several Wi-Fi 
connections 
have 
been 
studied 
and 
implemented. 
Performance 
evaluation 
has 
been 
considered 
as 
a 
fundamentally important criterion to assess communications 
quality. The motivation of this work is to evaluate 
performance in laboratory measurements of WPA point-to-
point links using new available equipments. Comparisons are 
made to corresponding results obtained for WEP and open 
links. This contribution permits to increase the knowledge 
about performance of Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 a,g) point-to-point 
links [4-6]. The problem statement is that performance needs 
to be evaluated under security encryption. The solution 
proposed uses an experimental setup and method, permitting 
to monitor signal to noise ratios (SNR) and noise levels (N) 
and measure TCP throughput (from TCP connections) and 
UDP jitter and percentage datagram loss (from UDP 
communications).  
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
The 
measurements 
used 
a 
D-Link 
DAP-1522 
bridge/access point [13], with internal PIFA *2 antenna, 
IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, firmware version 1.31 and a 100-Base-
TX/10-Base-T Allied Telesis AT-8000S/16 level 2 switch 
[14]. The wireless mode was set to access point mode. The 
firmware from the manufacturer did not make possible a 
point-to-point link with a similar equipment. Therefore, a 
personal computer (PC) was used having a PCMCIA 
IEEE.802.11 a/b/g/n Linksys WPC600N wireless adapter 
with three internal antennas [15], to enable a PTP link to the 
access point. In every type of experiment, interference free 
communication channels were used (ch 36 for 802.11a; ch 8 
for 802.11g). This was checked through a portable computer, 
equipped with a Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n adapter, running 
NetStumbler software [16]. WPA personal encryption was 
activated in the AP and the PC wireless adapter using AES 
and a shared key with 26 ASCII characters. WEP encryption 
was activated in both equipments, using 128 bit encryption 
and a key composed of 26 ASCII characters. The 
experiments were made under far-field conditions. No power 
levels above 30 mW (15 dBm) were required, as the access 
points were close. 
A laboratory setup has been planned and implemented 
for the measurements, as shown in Fig. 1. At OSI level 4, 
measurements were made for TCP connections and UDP 
communications using Iperf software [17]. For a TCP 
connection, TCP throughput was obtained. For a UDP 
communication with a given bandwidth parameter, UDP 
throughput, jitter and percentage loss of datagrams were 
determined. Parameterizations of TCP packets, UDP 
datagrams and window size were as in [10]. One PC, with IP 
192.168.0.2 was the Iperf server and the other, with IP 
192.168.0.6, was the Iperf client. Jitter, representing the 
smooth mean of differences between consecutive transit 
times, was continuously computed by the server, as specified 
by the real time protocol (RTP), in RFC 1889 [18]. The 
scheme of Fig. 1 was also used for FTP measurements, 
where the FTP server and the client applications were 
installed in the PCs with IPs 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.6, 
respectively. The server PC also permitted manual control of 
the settings in the access point. 
The server and client PCs were HP nx9030 and nx9010 
portable computers, respectively, running Windows XP. 
They were configured to optimize the resources allocated to 
the present work. Batch command files have been written to 
enable the TCP, UDP and FTP tests. The results were 
obtained in batch mode and written as data files to the client 
PC disk. Each PC had a second network adapter, to permit 
remote control from the official IP University network, via 
switch. 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The access point and the PC wireless network adapter 
were manually configured, for both standards IEEE 802.11 a, 
g, with typical fixed transfer rates (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54 
Mbps). For every fixed transfer rate, data were obtained for 
comparison of the laboratory performance of the links at OSI 
layers 1 (physical layer), 4 (transport layer) and 7 
(application layer) using the setup of Fig. 1. For each 
standard and every nominal fixed transfer rate, an average 
TCP throughput was determined from several experiments. 
This value was used as the bandwidth parameter for every 
corresponding UDP test, giving average jitter and average 
percentage datagram loss. 
At OSI level 1, noise levels (N, in dBm) and signal to 
noise ratios (SNR, in dB) were monitored and typical values 
are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 for WPA and WEP links, 
respectively. They are similar to those obtained for open 
links. 
The main average TCP and UDP results are summarized 
in Table I, both for WPA and open links. The statistical 
analysis, including calculations of confidence intervals, was 
carried out as in [19]. In Figs. 4-5, polynomial fits were 
made (shown as y versus x), using the Excel worksheet,  to 
the 802.11 a, g TCP throughput data for WPA and open 
links, respectively, where R2 is the coefficient of 
determination. It provides information about the goodness of 
fit. If it is 1.0, it indicates a perfect fit to data. It was found 
that the best TCP throughputs are for 802.11 a, for every link 
type, where the best SNR values were measured. The 802.11 
a, g average data are reasonably close for all link types. The 
best average 802.11g TCP throughput is for open links. In 
Figs. 6-10, the data points representing jitter and percentage 
datagram loss were joined by smoothed lines. The jitter data 
show some fluctuations in some cases, mainly for 802.11a, 
as seen in Figs. 6 and 8. It was found that, on average, the 
best jitter performances are for 802.11 g for all link types. 
On average, for both 802.11 a and 802.11 g, the jitter 
performances were not found significantly sensitive, within 
the experimental errors, to link type. In Figs. 9-10, where 
percentage datagram loss data are shown, the error bars are 
well visible.

The best performances were for 802.11 a for both link types. 
Increasing security encryption was found to degrade 
performance for both standards 802.11 a,g. This is expected 
due to increased data length. 
At OSI level 7, we measured the FTP transfer rates 
versus nominal transfer rates configured in the access points 
for IEEE 802.11 a, g as in [11]. The average results thus 
obtained are summarized in Table I, both for WPA and open 
links. In Fig. 11 polynomial fits are shown to 802.11 a, g 
data for WEP links. The results show the same trends found 
for TCP throughput. 
Generally, except for 802.11g TCP throughput and 
802.11 a,g percentage datagram loss, where increasing 
security encryption was found to degrade performances, the 
results measured for WPA links were found to agree, within 
the experimental errors, with corresponding data obtained for 
all link types. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
A new laboratory setup arrangement has been planned 
and implemented, that permitted systematic performance 
measurements of new available wireless equipments (DAP-
1522 access points from D-Link and WPC600N adapters 
from Linksys) for Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 b,g) in WPA point-to-
point links.  
Through OSI layer 4, TCP throughput, jitter and 
percentage datagram loss were measured and compared for 
WPA, WEP and open links. It was found that the best TCP 
throughputs were found for 802.11a, for every link type. 
Generally, except for 802.11g TCP throughput and 802.11 
a,g percentage datagram loss, where increasing security 
encryption was found to degrade performances, the results 
measured for WPA links were found to agree, within the 
experimental errors, with corresponding data obtained for all 
link types. Jitter performances were not found significantly 
sensitive, within the experimental errors, to link type. 
At OSI layer 7, FTP performance results have shown the 
same trends found for TCP throughput. 
Future performance studies are planned using several 
equipments, security settings and experimental conditions, 
not only in laboratory but also in outdoor environments 
involving, mainly, medium range links.
