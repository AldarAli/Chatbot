Abstract - The proliferation of the Internet has attracted 
much attention with regard to the leakage of online 
private/personal information, as exposed information is 
being used for criminal purposes. In this regard, a 
criterion for information privacy must be clarified for 
governments and other public institutions as well as 
private enterprises in order to curtail information privacy 
violations and criminal activity. In order to apply such an 
information privacy criterion, we propose a global-scale 
information privacy infringement index, known as the 
Global Information Privacy Infringement Index (GPI). 
The GPI examines the level of information privacy 
infringement by measuring the factors, such as types, 
records, sources, characteristics, and actions based on 
infringed records for each country. Our approach can be 
a useful guide for governments, the public and private 
enterprises in their efforts to enhance information privacy.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The number of Internet users stands at nearly 3.4 
billion as of July, 2016, meaning that 40 percent of the 
world population is currently connected to the Internet 
[1]. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has 
also contributed to the rapid proliferation of mobile 
Internet users such that the Internet has now become 
absolutely inseparable tool from the lives of people.  
Despite the great benevolent intention of the Internet, 
the leakage of online private/personal information has 
been a significant issue around the world. The security 
burden of protecting personal information applies to all 
countries. Currently, companies in the US are 
experiencing losses of more than 525 million US dollars 
annually due to cybercrime based on malicious codes 
[2]. The increase in cybercrime has had profound effects 
on consumers. The largest infringes of information 
amount to more than 130 million user accounts. The 
potential targets of phishing attacks are mostly online 
brands such as PayPal and EBay, an online payment 
provider and online auction site, respectively [2].  
The 
importance 
of 
maintaining 
reasonable 
expectations of privacy does not literally mean only 
preserving personal information, but also, the respecting 
human rights. For instance, the Identity Card Act [3] 
was proposed in the UK in 2006. The Identity Card Act 
was proposed to facilitate a reliable and secure record of 
individual registrations in the UK. It also promises a 
useful means for individuals to prove their identities. 
Initially, it was created to protect Britain against 
terrorism, organized crime, and to prevent identity theft, 
illegal immigration and illegal employment. However, 
the Identity Card Act was repealed due to criticism 
related to privacy and human rights issues. Privacy 
campaigner, who stood against the Act, argued that the 
identity database is a likely target for abuse. For instance, 
members of the witness protection program, celebrities 
and victims of domestic violence can be targeted as 
vulnerable groups in that their personal information can 
be stolen and sold. Moreover, on 2 February 2005, the 
UK Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights 
challenged the compatibility of the Bill in consideration 
of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human 
Rights and Article 14, both from the Human Rights Act 
1998 [4]. Thus, many in Britain believed that Identity 
Cards Act was in violation of the right to privacy and 
the right to non-discrimination, as encompassed in the 
Human Rights Act.  
In South Korea, three major credit card companies 
were targeted by malicious outsiders, leading to the 
leakage of 104 million instances of information, 
specifically 
cardholders’ 
personal 
and 
financial 
information, in 2013 [5]. After this major leak from the 
card companies, billions stolen from NongHyup Bank, 
one of the major banks in South Korea, it was assumed 
that hackers used pharming attack with the victims’ 
personal information [6]. According to Statistics Korea 
(KOSTAT), 152,151 records 
were reported as 
undergoing an information privacy infringement in 
2015. These instances are classified into unauthorized 
collections of personal information, unauthorized 
abuses of personal information, illegal uses of personal 
identification numbers, cases not subject to the law, and 
others. In the records, the illegal use of personal 
identification numbers accounts for the largest 
proportion of information privacy infringements, at 
77,598 records, i.e., 51 percent of the entire number of 
records [7].

Therefore, it is essential to make the conditions of 
the online environment safer and more secure by 
encouraging the involvement of the public and of the 
government. In this regard, a criterion pertaining to 
information privacy must be clarified by the government, 
public and private enterprises in order to curtail online 
privacy violations and criminal activity. In order to 
apply a criterion of privacy, we propose an information 
privacy index, which works on a global scale, known as 
the GPI. The GPI examines the level of information 
privacy by measuring the factors such as types, records, 
sources, characteristics, and actions based on infringed 
records which have occurred in the country. This 
approach can be a useful guide to the public and to 
government and private organizations as they attempt to 
enhance information privacy.  
The contributions of this paper are as follows:  
First, we propose the GPI as a means of measuring 
the level of information privacy for each country. With 
regard to the GPI, we successfully quantified the level 
of information privacy, making it much easier for people 
to increase their self-awareness of information privacy 
in their country of residence.  
Second, we attempt to provide an empirical analysis 
on the basis of publicly available data. In this way, we 
do not provide any ambiguous or estimated data about 
the privacy level in near future but rather give 
information about the present based on the publicly 
disclosed records.  
Last, we demonstrate the GPI for five countries as 
case studies by applying our method using infringed 
records from around the globe. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II 
consists of the basic concepts of the GPI. In this section, 
we clarify the definition and provide background 
information. Related work with regard to the GPI is 
presented in Section III. In Section IV, a description of 
GPI is given in detail. The GPI is measured and 
evaluated in Section V. We finalize the paper in Section 
VI.  
II. 
BASIC CONCEPTS 
This section presents the definition of privacy and 
information privacy and background information 
related to GPI.  
A. Privacy, Information Privacy and Personal 
Information 
Privacy is ambiguous in that includes a broad range 
of concepts, such as freedom of thought, control over 
personal information, and others. According to the 
United Nation (UN), “Privacy can be defined as the 
presumption that individuals should have an area of 
autonomous development, interaction and liberty, a 
‘private sphere’ with or without interaction with others, 
free from State intervention and from excessive 
unsolicited intervention by other uninvited individuals. 
The right to privacy is also the ability of individuals to 
determine who holds information about them and how 
that information is used” [8]. 
Privacy has become a controversial issue which has 
a profound impact around the globe. Protecting privacy 
is now a subjective goal for nearly every nation, with 
numerous statutes, constitutional rights, and judicial 
decisions affecting these efforts. Most nations around 
the globe note privacy in their constitutions for the 
protection of citizens. Even if privacy is not mentioned 
in constitutions, many countries are aware of the 
importance of constitutional rights to privacy, including 
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and India [9]. 
Information privacy is an emerging topic with the 
advent of the Internet, as personal information is 
digitalized on the Internet for many purposes. The 
definition of information privacy must encompass an 
important feature to refer also to the privacy of 
digitalized personal data which is stored on a computer 
system. Information privacy concerns the collection and 
dissemination of data, technology, legal and political 
issues surrounding them. 
There is great ambiguity in the way ‘personal 
information’ is used. In the context of privacy or 
academic research, personal information refers to 
information that is sensitive and any information that 
can designate or identify a person [10]. Personal 
information, under the law of South Korea, is defined as 
a personal information related to a natural person whom 
he or she must be alive. Personal information means an 
information that can designate or identify an alive 
person. If collected information does not identify a 
person, it still counts as a personal information when 
collected information can be easily combined with other 
information [11]. In the European Union Directive, 
“personal data shall mean any information relating to an 
identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly 
or indirectly, in particular by reference to an 
identification number or to one or more factors specific 
to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity [12].” Personal information 
can appear in online and offline environments. This 
paper focuses on digitalized personal information that is 
acquired, stored on, abused, and/or removed from a 
computer system. 
B. Personal Identification Number 
The definition of a ‘personal identification number’ 
[13] differs for each country. Such numbers are termed 
national identification number, national identity number, 
national insurance number, personal identification 
number, 
or 
resident 
registration 
number. 
The 
governments 
of 
many 
countries

identification number as means of tracking citizens and 
permanent/temporary residents. Personal identification 
numbers can be given to foreigners for guidance and to 
differentiate them from citizens. Moreover, personal 
identification numbers can be used for tracking for the 
purposes of employment, taxation, governmental 
benefits, health care, and other government related 
functions. They are not widely used in relation to 
violations of human rights, but some countries still 
maintain the system for convenience in managing 
citizens.  
Various personal identification number systems are 
implemented among countries; however, most nations 
issue an identification number when citizens are born or 
when they reach a certain age (or legal age). For 
noncitizens, identification numbers can be issued when 
they enter the country and/or when they are granted a 
temporary/permanent resident permit, but the numbers 
will be issued with a different logic from that used with 
citizens. Many countries have attempted to issue 
identification numbers for singular purposes, but many 
of these efforts have been halted due to strong resistance 
from human rights movements. In fact, personal 
identification number system is still used in some 
countries.  
C. A Comparison of Personal Identification Number 
Systems  
As noted above, personal identification number 
systems vary across among countries. In this subsection, 
we provide more detailed information about the 
personal identification number among five countries; 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, 
and South Korea. In addition, we analyze the domain of 
personal identification number in five sector; Passport 
Issuance, Driver License, Taxation, Social Insurance, 
and Finance summarized in Table 1. These five sectors 
are critical in that each nation uses a different approach 
to authenticate users and collect personal information.  
The United States developed its Social Security 
Number (SSN) [14] system for the organization of 
social security related benefits. However, the number is 
now used for other purposes, working as a personal 
identification number system. For passport issuance, a 
person needs to prove his or her citizenship (such as 
proof of birth, certification of citizenship, or 
certification of naturalization), and the SSN must be 
given [15]. For a driver’s license, proof of birth and 
identification documents must be given along with the 
SSN [16]. For taxation, four types of taxation numbers 
exist; Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), Employer 
Identification Number (EIN), Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Number (ITIN), and Preparer Taxpayer 
Identification Number (PTIN) [17]. For finance, the 
SSN is not necessarily a required condition.   
In the United Kingdom, there is no official personal 
identification number system and legal requirement to 
possess any types of identification document to prove 
one’s identity. However, there is the National Insurance 
Number (NIN) [18], which is issued to all citizens in the 
United Kingdom for the purpose of insurance. The NIN 
is issued when legal age is turned 16. The NIN is not 
mandatory to possess, and driver’s license is generally 
used as proof of identity. In order to issue a driver’s 
license, proof of identification must be submitted such 
as proof of birth or a passport. When applying online, 
the driver’s license issuing institution may collect the 
NIN [19]. For taxation, the NIN is needed in order to 
issue a Unique Tax Reference (UTR). Employers collect 
the NINs of employees for taxation related purposes 
[20]. For finance, the NIN is rarely used, whereas 
driver’s licenses and passports are mostly used as proof 
of address and identity [21].  
In Germany, there is the Neuer Personalausweis 
(nPA), but it does not function as a personal 
identification number. The nPA, which is known as an 
ID card system, is heavily regulated in terms of its usage. 
Almost every sector issues a unique number that each 
sector such as passport, driver license, taxation, social 
insurance, and finance has its own unique number. The 
nPA is used as an authentication method but storing or 
wiring nPA information with the unique number is 
regulated. This ID card system nPA is implemented in 
2010 that is an electronic high-tech ID card using, for 
instance, Radio-Frequency ID (RFID), cryptographic 
technique, secure storage, and others. Validation using 
the nPA lasts 10 years, and a new number is issued when 
the card is lost or reissued. The collection of the nPA by 
private institution is illegal. For the protection of 
personal information, there is no unified number that 
grants access to social security services in Germany. 
There are unique numbers for each social security 
services wiring these numbers with the nPA is illegal 
[22][23].  
My Number [24] of Japan is a newly emerging 
personal identification number system which started in 
2016. My Number is a 12 digits number issued to all 
residents of Japan, including temporary and permanent 
residents with valid permits. The previous personal 
identification number system was only used for taxation, 
social insurance, and medical insurance purposes. 
However, the Japanese government has stepped forward 
to centralize the system with a number for nearly every 
sector, to eventually become a unique number for the 
entire system. Thus, My Number will be used for 
taxation, social security, driver’s license, and a passport 
[25].  
In South Korea, the Resident Registration Number 
(RRN) [26] is a 13-digit number issued to all residents 
of the country. The system started on November of 1968 
15

CYBER 2017 : The Second International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

for the purpose of identifying spies. The RRN is used in 
nearly every sector not only as an authentication method 
but also as a key number with which to make inquiries 
into the system. Even up to August of 2012, the RRN 
was ruthlessly collected by public and private 
institutions for convenience [27]. There are critical 
problems which have long occurred in South Korea 
associated with the extensive use of the RRN. First, the 
South Korean government has implemented an e-
government system and there are at least 1,100 
information systems under 47 administrative agencies 
which are linked in a single integrated government 
network [28]. These distributed information systems are 
integrated instantly when the RRN is entered into the 
system. Thus, personal information in every sector can 
be easily acquired by the government which can lead to 
the serious problem of state surveillance. Secondly, the 
meaningless collection of the RRN by private 
companies has led to many accidents, such as leakages 
of RRN. Moreover, the most critical problem related to 
the RRN is that leaked RRNs cannot be changed during 
the course of one’s lifetime once they are issued.

RELATED WORKS 
In this section, we briefly survey the works that are 
relevant to the GPI.   
A. The Breach Level Index 
The Breach Level Index [29] aims to provide the 
overall breach severity level by tracking publicly known 
breaches to allow organizations to measure their own 
risk assessment. The Breach Level Index does not set an 
upper limit, but the largest breach scores are 10 thus far. 
The Index is in logarithmic (base 10) scales used similar 
to the scales for volcanoes and earthquakes [30][31]. 
However, the Breach Level Index is designed to provide 
a risk assessment tool specifically targeting enterprises. 
The GPI tends to complement the weaknesses of the 
Breach Level Index to provide a national level scale to 
acknowledge 
the 
level 
of 
information 
privacy 
infringement. 
B. The Global Cybersecurity Index 
The Global Cybersecurity Index [32] is a project that 
aims to measure each nation’s level of commitment to 
cybersecurity. The final goal of the GCI is to advocate 
for a global culture of cybersecurity and its integration 
in 
terms 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technologies. The Global Cybersecurity Index covers 
the five areas of legal measures, technical measures, 
organizational 
measures, 
capacity 
building, 
and 
cooperation. These five areas have a profound impact on 
cybersecurity with regard to assessing national 
capabilities as they form the building blocks of national 
capabilities. The GCI covers various fields but their 
global ranking of cybersecurity index is relatively 
impractical. The GCI only focuses on the existence of 
national structures in place rather than actual 
cybersecurity level for a particular country. Ironically, 
the GCI has reported that the United States of America 
is placed at first in their cybersecurity index; however, 
the U.S. is happened to be the country with highest 
number of cybersecurity related accidents according to 
the Breach Level Index. GPI scale aims to provide 
information based on infringed records that focuses 
more on evidence rather than the infrastructure. Thus, 
GPI is based on the fact itself as well as the details 
occurred in the specific country.  
C. The Global Conflict Risk Index 
The Global Conflict Risk Index (GCRI) [33] was 
developed by the Joint Research Center. The GCRI is 
designed to assist with decision making about long-term 
conflict risk by providing accessible and objective open 
sources. The contributions of the GCRI are described as 
follow: It clarifies the definitions of ‘risk’ and ‘risk 
conflict’ which derived from existing methodologies of 
conflict research. In addition, five risk areas for each 
state are presented for a quick overview of the structural 
conditions of the state. Moreover, it provides an 
evaluation and an assessment of a particular country’s 
risk. The GCRI is focused on the risk that can occur in 
a certain country. However, the GPI is more focused on 
infringement level as opposed to the level of risk in a 
country. 
D. The Crime Rate 
The crime rate represents the number of offenses per 
certain number of people. The Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) [34] releases crime statistics, 
dividing the number of crimes by 100,000 inhabitants. 
The GPI has benchmarked the concept of the crime rate 
as the number of infringed records per the number of 
data production. Moreover, we attempt to provide a 
16

level of information privacy infringement at present 
based on the publicly disclosed records.  
IV. 
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GPI 
This section presents a description of the GPI with 
regard to categories and methodology. 
A. Categories 
The GPI model deals with five factors, as seen in 
Table 2. ‘N’ represents the total number of infringement 
records, 
specifically 
representing 
when 
private 
information has been leaked. For instance, the number 
of records infringed was 24 million in the case of 
Zappos, when they were hacked by a malicious hacker 
[35]. We measure the total IP traffic of the country as 
‘I’, as indicated. Since the amount of data production is 
not publicly available, the total IP traffic brought by 
Cisco VNI [36] is used to consider the amount of data 
produced in a certain country. The type of data in the 
records ‘t’ ranging from 1 (least) to 5 (most) covering 
all types of data, ranging from less important 
information to the most important information. Identity 
theft, which is ranked 4 in Table 2, has been developed 
from the conventional type specifically noting what 
types of identification were infringed. It is important to 
consider what caused the information to be leaked. In 
this regard, ‘s’ represents the source of the infringement 
ranging from 1 to 5 and covering a lost/stolen device, 
malicious insider/outsider, and state sponsored attacker. 
Leaked information can be replaced or reissued but 
particular information is an exception. For example, if a 
user’s email address is leaked, it can be easily replaced 
with another email address. The user may experience 
inconvenience when replacing his lifelong email 
address but it may not harm his personal life. However, 
an information like RRN, a type of personal 
identification number in South Korea, is permanent and 
unique number and being used for multiple purposes as 
a method of online/offline authentication. As a 
consequence, leaked RRN has been adversely abused 
for pharming attack, phishing, and various types of 
fraud. In this sense, it is vital to measure the value of 
personal identification number system as noted ‘c’ as 
characteristics of personal identification number system 
in the GPI. The ‘c’ is ranging from 1 to 5 with regard to 
the personal identification number system. Leaked 
information can be used for the secondary purposes as 
well. Stolen identity can be used to target the victim, or 
it can be used to access their financial account. The type 
of actions denoted by ‘A’ in the GPI refers to instances 
of the secondary use of data.

B. Methodology 
The methodology of our approach for the GPI relies 
on publicly disclosed infringed records. The equation of 
the GPI is presented below. 
 
GPI =  ∑
[log⁡(
𝑁
𝐼 ∗ 𝑡 ∗ 𝑠 ∗ 𝑐 ∗ 𝐴)]𝑥
𝑛
𝑥=1
 
 
The GPI aims to cover all infringed or leaked 
information occurring at a national level. We divide the 
total number of infringement records ‘N’ by ‘I’ denoting 
the IP traffic of a country. After multiplying each 
category of the data, we use the logarithm (base 10) 
scale to make it as simple as the system used in the 
Breach Level Index. In the equation, ‘x’ represents an 
event of each infringed record which occurs in a 
particular country. The sum of ‘n’ number of records 
will represent the entire set of infringed information 
occurring in a certain country. Finally, the score of the 
GPI does not set the upper limit as benchmarked from 
the crime rate.  
V. 
EVALUATION 
We evaluate the GPI based on the methodology 
introduced in the previous section. We used the sets of 
infringed records derived from Breach Level Index [29] 
for five countries such as the United States, the United

Among many other countries, the United States 
accounts for the largest amount of infringed information 
around the world. There are 1,257 infringed records for 
the period from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 
2014. However, due to the exceeding number of records, 
we discard the records scoring below 6 in the Breach 
level Index. The data of the United States implies that 
more information infringements are likely to occur in 
the United States, as much more information is 
produced there than in any other country. The total 
amount of IP traffic produced within the United States 
was 18.1 exabytes in 2014, clearly higher than those 
figures for other countries. As a result, the United States 
scored 934 on the GPI. Various causes can explain why 
the United States is the country with the greatest amount 
of infringed information, but this does not mean that the 
level of privacy is low there. It is arguable that the 
United States may report the infringement records more 
transparently than other countries.  
Similar to the United States, the total number of 
infringed records was 135 in 2014 in the UK. We 
discarded information which scored under 6 points from 
the dataset for the same reason given in the previous 
case. We accumulated all of the infringed record of the 
United Kingdom in 2014 as well as the total IP traffic in 
2014, which was 2.4 exabytes. The United Kingdom 
does not have a personal identification number, with 
individual identification numbers issued from different 
institutions. In this sense, most of the identification 
numbers in the UK can be replaced or reissued easily, 
but information there can still be used to identify a 
person. As a result, the United Kingdom scored 159 on 
the GPI. 
In South Korea, there are 12 infringed records in 
2014. Although South Korea has fewer infringed 
records, they scored 73. In 2014, the three largest credit 
companies had 104 million records of personal 
information stolen and leaked, including RRN. Unlike 
other countries, South Korea is the only country using a 
RRN, a personal identification number system for which 
the number cannot be replaced or reissued once it is 
issued. The RRN can be used as an online and offline as 
a means of authentication, and it is used extensively in 
many sectors in South Korea. Most phishing and 
pharming attacks are initiated by identifying a person 
through their RRN. Thus, the RRN is a critical factor 
which violates the privacy level in South Korea, and this 
resulted in a higher GPI score. 
In Germany, there are ten infringed records in 2014. 
Compared to the United States and the United Kingdom, 
there are relatively few records. Germany’s GPI is 38. 
Germany has a strong regulation on the usage of 
personal identification number system that the domain 
of ID card is far lower than any other countries. The nPA, 
an ID card system of Germany, can easily be replaced 
and reissued that it has absolutely no harm on citizens in 
Germany. 
In Japan, since there are 12 infringed records in 2014, 
the GPI is 31. The GPI score is low, but several factors 
should be considered. Japan has adopted an electronic 
national identification number system known as ‘My 
Number’ that can be used to identify a person. The 
system can lead to serious phishing or pharming attacks, 
as shown in the case of South Korea. However, the 
infringed information in 2014 does not include any 
information from the ‘My Number’ system, resulting in 
a score for Japan that was relatively low compared to 
those of other countries. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
The GPI aims to provide a useful criterion when 
dealing with information privacy infringement issues on 
a global scale. The GPI can be enhanced in various 
forms, such as through a regression analysis, a multi-
year data analysis, and others. The model can be 
advanced if we consider the cost aspects of information 
privacy infringement. Moreover, multi-year data of the 
cost is publicly disclosed, our model can be much 
developed.   
Our initiative of providing information about the 
level of information privacy infringement on a global 
scale is certainly a valuable means of alerting to the 
world. We continue to complement our GPI 
methodology to cover every country around the world 
for a brighter and more secure future.
