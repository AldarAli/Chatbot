Abstract— Informal learning at the workplace is a crucial 
ingredient in updating and upskilling today’s workforce, but in 
many jobs, informal learning opportunities are scarce. Bite-
sized learning via mobile devices (Mobile Micro-Learning, 
MML) can be a powerful means to enhance informal work-
related learning also in such learning-deprived fields. Based on 
good practices of recent MML implementations, a lightweight 
approach is developed. It involves an instructional blueprint 
and an open-source, low-threshold technology for MML, and 
meets the specific needs of workers in learning-deprived fields. 
The main idea is a scan-to-learn system where Quick Response 
(QR) codes are attached to physical objects in the work 
environment. Workers can scan the QR codes to learn and are 
directed to short, interactive learning nuggets. For evaluation, 
a proof-of-concept is provided.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Work-based learning is seen as a powerful means for  
continuously updating workers’ qualifications on the job [1], 
with the lion’s share of learning being informal [2]. Informal 
learning takes place outside a prescribed learning framework 
(no organized event or package) and without a professional 
trainer [3]–[5]. It may be conceived as learning in work [6]: 
Embedded (“situated”) in daily work routines [1][5], 
informal learning is initiated in a self-directed manner by 
workers and triggered by “an internal or external jolt” [4], 
i.e., on demand when a specific work task is requiring it. 
Typical examples are observing, seeking help or feedback 
from others, discussing, experimenting (learning by just 
doing the job), trial and error, reflecting or searching the 
intra- or Internet for information [1][4]. Informal learning 
can hence rely on the interaction with others (“social 
learning”), or on 
self-initiated 
study, 
practice 
and 
experimentation (“learning by doing”) [4]. 
However, in many occupational fields, the conditions for 
informal learning at work limited: In decentralized work 
settings (e.g., train, trucks or delivery drivers, mobile care 
workers), there is little direct interaction between workers. 
The same is true in highly mechanized settings with large 
physical 
distances 
between 
workers, 
and 
in 
work 
environments with a lot of noise or high language diversity 
among workers – all of which is rather typical for blue-collar 
work [7][8]. This hampers learning by observing, asking 
questions and receiving feedback [9].  
Due to tight schedules or high degrees of automation, 
many jobs offer little autonomy, which is seen as a crucial 
condition for experimentation on-the-job or other self-
directed learning activities  [8][10]. Finally, access to 
codified organizational or external knowledge from the 
Internet [11] is difficult for those who have no permanent 
access to a stationary desktop computer. “Learning-
deprived” jobs [9] typically suffer from reduced speed and 
intensity of informal learning at the workplace and 
jeopardize workforce upskilling. 
Such limited opportunities for informal learning at work 
weight all the heavier as often, the knowledge or skills 
needed to continue one’s work or to start with learning-by-
doing would not require extensive educational content, but 
rather a little tweak. Learning based on bite-sized learning 
nuggets has been termed micro-learning or Mobile Micro-
Learning (MML) as it is typically delivered by mobile 
devices [12] . 
This paper shows to what extent MML can help to 
improve 
work-related 
learning 
in 
learning-deprived 
environments. We propose a lightweight approach to situate 
MML units in daily work routines with QR codes affixed to 
physical objects in the work environment (mobile tagging). 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II 
illustrates existing concepts and good practices of micro-
learning at the workplace and explores its potential for 
informal learning. We then sketch our lightweight approach 
for informal MML at the workplace and illustrate it with a 
proof-of-concept based on a combination of freely available 
open-source tools (Section III). In Section IV, we discuss our 
findings, critically reflect on our approach and conclude with 
an outlook.            
II. 
RELATED WORK AND GOOD PRACTICES 
A. Mobile Micro-Learning 
Micro-learning typically consists of short learning 
nuggets (1-5 minutes) that are focused on one narrow topic 
and that are provided in rich, interactive media formats [12]–
[14], e.g., (animated) videos, podcasts, job aids, cheat sheets, 
flashcards, quizzes or even gamified elements [15] and 
virtual reality nuggets [16]. Micro-learning is undertaken

just-in-time when needed (“on demand”) [12]. In this 
context, mobile technologies are found to naturally match the 
concept of micro-learning and play an important role in its 
delivery [17][18]. The use of mobile devices (e.g., 
smartphones, tablets) for learning anytime without being tied 
to a tightly-delimited physical location [19] is termed mobile 
learning [20][21]. In what follows, we subsume the above-
mentioned learning practices under Mobile Micro-Learning 
(MML) [13][14]. Note that in the context of informal 
learning at the workplace, the concepts of micro-learning and 
micro-training are often used interchangeably, as both refer 
to short, often digital training or learning activities that can 
be easily integrated in daily work routines  [22][23]. In this 
paper, we stick to the term (mobile) micro-learning because 
it favors somewhat more the notions of self-directed learning 
that go beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge and skills.    
MML has been found to increase learners’ motivation, 
improved knowledge retention thanks to reduced cognitive 
load and repetition [14][18][24]. A the same time, it is an 
efficient strategy to integrate learning into busy schedules, 
also for employees working in distributed settings [24][25].  
MML seems appropriate for and widely used in informal 
learning settings [15], also if implemented at the workplace 
[14]. It stimulates self-directed learning, allowing learners to 
consume learning nuggets on-demand when they get aware 
of a problem or question in a specific situation [26], [27]. 
MML can be easily embedded in daily work routines and 
allows for informal work-related learning, also in deprived 
work settings as described in Section I (decentralized work, 
limited opportunities for interaction, lack of access to 
desktop computers). If properly designed, MML is not 
limited to the acquisition of narrow knowledge or skills, but 
may also enable higher-order learning [26] which is 
particularly relevant for the experimental and reflective 
dimensions of informal work-related learning [28]. 
B. Examples of Mobile Micro-Learning at the Workplace 
Researchers and practitioners highlight the potential of 
MML for onboarding, ongoing professional qualification, 
and just-in-time learning [29]–[32]. Typical applications of 
MML at the workplace are compliance training in 
occupational safety [33] or information system security 
[34][35], building knowledge on new and existing products 
[36]–[38], or improving customer service [32]. Other, albeit 
less frequent are providing procedural work instructions e.g., 
for installing or technical equipment [37] or in medical care 
[39], and machine use [40]–[42], as well as improving soft 
skills such as team management or goal setting [44][45]. 
Prominent examples from the industry are micro-learning 
initiatives 
for 
occupational 
safety 
at 
Walmart 
or 
Bloomingdale’s that came with high participation rates and 
considerable savings [24] or the case of InterContinental 
Hotels Group to improve the management of complex 
customer service requests based on micro-learning which 
helped to reduce onboarding time for new employees from 
five to two weeks [45].  
Recent scientific cases and evaluation studies on MML in 
real-life work settings cover a great variety of topics, e.g., 
how to keep costs in large building projects [46], dementia-
friendly approaches for staff in neighborhood convenience 
stores 
[48][49], 
methods 
and 
approaches 
in 
pharmacovigilance [49] as well as a great number of 
examples from health and medical care [40][51]. Further 
attempts have been made in the hospitality sector [32], in 
logistics [51], in ICT [53][54], for public administration and 
NATO staff [30][55], for librarians [55], for school and 
university teachers [57][58] as well as for childcare workers 
[58], and even for employees of dairy farms [59]. However, 
these examples are either not validated in a real-world 
setting, contain little information about the actual approach, 
rely on relatively lengthy learning units, or were published 
before 2020. Recent topical reviews provide even more 
examples 
for 
MML 
[17][21][24][29][57][61]–[63]. 
However, many of these studies were tested in an 
educational setting, only. 
Six studies were analyzed in-depth (S1 – S6, see Table 1) 
to investigate how companies and public organizations 
implement MML. All were conducted in real-work settings, 
underwent scientific evaluation, and contained sufficient 
details about implementation. The examples chosen rely on 
short learning nuggets (< 5 min) and primarily draw on rich, 
interactive media. Looking at studies published not later than 
2020 allows us to get an overview of the state-of-the-art.   
As the focus of this paper is to study the potential of 
MML for informal learning in learning-deprived work 
settings, four aspects are central: 
 
To what extent can learners self-direct their learning 
activities? 
 
Are forms of higher-order learning such as practice, 
experimentation, 
feedback, 
and 
reflection 
sufficiently triggered?  
 
How are learning activities “situated” in actual work 
routines? 
 
Do media formats and instructional strategies enable 
learning among workers who are not used to 
consuming longer verbal explanations or engaging in 
self-directed learning?

Three of the six examples analyzed come with a 
prescribed 
learning 
curriculum 
to 
improve 
specific 
competencies. S1 to S3 fall in this category. S1 consists of 
four modules, each comprising 6 to 8 short (2-3 min) videos 
and a final quiz at the end of every module [49]. Here, 
learning nuggets are not self-containing as content, practice, 
and quizzes are separated from each other [48][50]. In such a 
setting, learners are less expected to engage in self-directed 
learning but directed toward the predefined learning 
objectives in small steps. 
The three other studies, both from the medical and health 
care field, allow for more self-directed learning: In S4 [39], a 
group of Australian hospitals provides the micro-learning 
format “Take 5 – learning for busy people” to their care, 
medical and non-clinical staff. Learners go through slide 
decks with condensed information about clinical and non-
clinical topics. A learning nugget could explain the 
procedure in case of a “code blue” (a patient having a 
medical emergency such as cardiac arrest). Learning bites 
last about five minutes. Delivery happens browser-based by 
the internal website so that staff can search for learning 
nuggets whenever a problem or question arises during the 
work process. S5 applies an almost identical approach 
("Take 5" on teaching skills and learning science for faculty 
members in academic health centers [56]): A website 
contains 41 Take-5 videos, jointly with other resources for 
learning and development. The videos were professionally 
recorded, prepared in conversational language, and not 
longer than 800 words. A blueprint suited for just-in-time 
learning was suggested and used: A teaser with statistics, an 
expert testimonial, a question, or a call for action pointing 
out why the topic is relevant. Then evidence from the 
literature, expert advice, or tips and tricks were provided. 
Integrating animations helped to improve the retention of 
central issues. 
In S6 [50], nurses can access point-of-care training for 
high-risk, low volume-therapies based on Quick Response 
(QR) codes affixed to work equipment. Scanned with a 
smartphone, they link to short training videos (2-3 minutes).  
The preferred format used in the five examples of MML 
is slide desks, short video clips (sometimes animated), and 
quizzes. Only one study additionally uses animated videos 
and mini-simulation games [47]. Text-based information still 
plays an important role, as in some work situations, learners 
cannot play the audio, and videos have to come with 
transcripts, then [49].  
The focus of the analyzed MML seems to be more on 
information 
and 
learning 
and 
less 
on 
practice, 
experimentation and reflection. In study 1 [49], learners 
explicitly point out that they see included quizzes as a 
valuable instrument for self-assessment, feedback and 
reflection, but  would like to get more opportunities to 
practice. In S4 to S6, MML primarily relies on static 
microsites and video clips and does not offer quizzes or other 
activities related to reflection or practical exploration. A 
higher degree of self-directedness in learning seems to imply 
fewer opportunities for higher-order learning and vice versa.   
To conclude, the potential of MML for informal, work-
related learning depicted in Subsection II is realized only 
very selectively.  The first three studies use MML as the little 
brother or sister of e-learning: “e-learning courses […] based 
on micro-learning” [49, p. 1171] seem to be the method of 
choice to meet the requirements of a remote, distributed 
workforce that has little leeway for learning when at work. 
There is only low potential for informal learning while at 
work, as micro-learning is neither self-directed nor anchored 
in the work tasks employees perform when learning. In 
contrast, in S4 and S5 (website with an index of self-
contained learning nuggets), learners use learning nuggets as 
needed when administering a specific work task. Moreover, 
applying the same instructional blueprint and format for the 
learning nuggets to meet the needs of the learners appears to 
be a viable strategy.  
However, searching indexes of available learning nuggets 
using a mobile phone is unlikely to be effective in settings 
where workers tend to be less savvy in the self-directed use 
of large amounts of digital information. A promising 
approach seems to be letting learners access learning nuggets 
just in time at the workplace by linking them to QR codes in 
the physical work environment. So far, this approach is not 
widespread in the workplace. More MML implementations 
of that kind can be found in work-related laboratory settings 
[40] and education [62] or again in health and medical care 
to quickly access guidelines [63]. 
The instructional strategy adopted in the examples 
mainly underlines the use of (very) short learning nuggets, 
often based on videos or text-based information. Workers in 
noisy settings or with limited skills in verbal comprehension 
will, however, be less apt to understand spoken or written 
text. Furthermore, apart from using quizzes to self-assess 
learning progress, the examples analyzed do not provide 
novel insight into how we could enhance practice, 
experimentation, and reflection beyond the mere acquisition 
of knowledge and skills. This being a general problem in the 
design of MML [26], it constitutes a particular challenge 
when MML shall enhance informal work-related learning in 
very hands-on (and less academic) fields. 
Informal work-related learning based on MML requires a 
concise implementation strategy that allows for self-directed 
learning, anchors learning nuggets in work, allows for 
practice, experimentation, reflection, and feedback, and 
lowers learning barriers for less savvy users. Given that this 
is quite a challenge, it is not surprising that apart from a few 
applications in occupational safety training in large 
corporations and some examples from the hospitality sector, 
farming, and convenience stores, the majority of empirical 
studies on MML still refer to (higher) education and often 
related to science in general or medical and health services in 
particular, or foreign language acquisition.

APPROACH 
Based on our findings in Section II and general design

for 
MML

work-related learning in learning-deprived occupational 
contexts.

A. Suggestions for Design and Implementation 
A good point of departure for designing and 
implementing MML are the four principles for MML design 
summarized from earlier research by [26] and validated in a 
pilot test by [27].  
 
Principle 1: MML content should fit on the small 
screens of mobile devices. 
 
Principle 2: MML should address learners in the 
moment they feel the need to learn something. 
Connected to this, MML content should be short (no 
longer than 5 minutes). 
 
Principle 3a: MML learning nuggets should be 
designed following an instructional flow that starts 
with an information snippet to provide an aha 
moment about the relevance (step 1), followed by 
instructional snippets with short exercises (quizzes, 
micro games, ideas for practice and experimentation 
at the workplace) and instant feedback (step 2). This 
instructional flow is based on an earlier model of 
Gagne [64], as cited in [27].  
 
Principle 4a: MML content should be designed in a 
way that triggers interaction between the learner and 
the content (e.g. using practical and/or gamified 
activities). 
These four principles are an excellent starting point to 
design MML for informal work-related learning. To make 
them even more suited to support and trigger informal 
workplace-related MML in learning-deprived occupational 
contexts, the following clarifications and additions are put 
forth:  
 
Principle 2a (revised): We favor short learning 
nuggets covering a single topic (1-2 minutes) to fit 
tight schedules, meet a single, specific question 
arising from the work context and to reduce 
cognitive load for learners. This is particular 
important in the workplaces we focus that often are 
characterized by high time pressure (e.g. in health 
and care services) or a noisy work environment [42].  
 
Principle 2b (Mobile tagging system). To trigger 
learning from within work processes, several 
approaches [40], [62], [63] have found QR codes 
affixed to work equipment and locations to be a 
good practice to link to learning nuggets that might 
be useful in the respective work context. 
 
Principle 3a (revised): The instructional flow 
suggested helps to design learning nuggets that go 
beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge and that 
are still self-contained. However and as pointed out 
already 
by 
[26], 
besides 
opportunities 
for 
experimentation and practice, learning nuggets for 
effective workplace-learning should also contain 
practices for reflection, which further enhances 
higher order learning.   
 
Principle 4b: Animated videos or visual, interactive 
work aids should be preferred over text-based and 
verbal information to enable learners who are less 
used to consume large amounts of texts or speak 
another language.   
Revising and complementing the four original principles 
for designing MML content by [26] makes MML more 
lightweight: First of all, short videos preferably with 
visualizations and animations lower the barrier for learning 
for those with less favorable prerequisites for effective 
informal 
workplace-learning. 
Second, 
self-containing 
learning nuggets that also comprise reflective activities help 
to enhance higher order learning processes that are vital for 
successful workplace learning. Third and last, mobile 
tagging based on QR codes are a strong trigger to engage in 
informal learning activities when encountering questions and 
challenges in the work process.  
Similarly, implementing MML for informal workplace 
learning should be also lightweight from a company 
perspective. 
This 
is 
captured 
in 
two 
additional 
recommendations:  
Recommendation 1 refers to an easy-to-use authoring 
tool: Learning managers should be able to generate learning 
nuggets without too much effort, as studies show that time 
constraints, a lack of technical skills and inadequate 
infrastructure are major barriers for the implementation of 
digitally-supported learning activities [65]. Content types 
should support the instructional scheme suggested above and 
support mobile display. H5P allows the user to create 
HTML5 interactive content and publish it in learning or 
content management systems such as Moodle, Canvas, 
WordPress, or Drupal [66]. It is free and open source, 
appears easier to use than most commercial e-learning 
authoring tools, and offers many predefined interactive 
formats that support active learning [67]. Moreover, H5P 
content can be shared and reused, and open licensing is 
encouraged [66]. An example of MML that uses H5P to 
implement interactive content is [52], whereas others use 
authoring tools such as Articulate Storyline 360 [51] or 
iSpring Suite [49], or simple video recording and editing 
software [40][51][57]. 
Recommendation 2 refers to a secured platform to 
manage, store and distribute learning nuggets: In most 
cases, developing a custom micro-learning platform will not 
be viable. Instead, many companies use a Learning 
Management Tool (LMS) with support for eLearning [68]. 
Most LMS support authoring and distribution of H5P 
content. However, introducing and operating a fully-fledged 
LMS exclusively for MML might be perceived as too high 
an investment. This will often be the case for Smaller and 
Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME). As an alternative, a more 
lightweight Content Management System (CMS) such as 
WordPress seems to be sufficient: It supports H5P content 
generation and storage, comes with user authentication and 
offers an appropriate structure to manage modular learning 
nuggets [68][69]. 
To 
conclude, 
the 
proposed 
principles 
and 
recommendations are considered effective in supporting our 
learners: They need short learning nuggets anchored in the 
work process that foster engagement in knowledge 
acquisition, practice, experimentation, and reflection. The 
low-threshold approach benefits learners in learning-
deprived work contexts who may be less adept at self-
directed learning. Similarly, creating and distributing 
56

eLmL 2023 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

learning nuggets is kept simple so that barriers to adoption 
are low, even for SMEs or companies with little experience 
with digital learning.  
B. Proof-of-Concept 
As a proof-of-concept, we use a simple website based on 
WordPress with an H5P plugin as a micro-learning platform. 
It comes with role-based authentication to protect learning 
nuggets against non-authorized viewing or editing.  
Figure 1 shows how learning managers would generate a 
learning nugget and attach the automatically generated QR 
code to a physical object in the work environment, where 
learners “Scan to learn” with their smartphone camera.  
An exemplary learning nugget has been developed and 
automatically equipped with a QR code. Hereby, an H5P 
content type “interactive video” is wrapped into a H5P 
element “KewAR Code” which auto-generates a QR code 
linking to the readily designed learning nugget when saved. 
Note that to reference H5P content instead of an URL or 
other text content, the content type “KewAR Code” has to be 
extended as suggested by [71]. The H5P plugin in Wordpress 
offers this combination of content types by default and 
provides comfortable authoring for such learning nuggets.  
The learning nugget has been structured as suggested 
above, following a blueprint that allows triggering higher-
order learning (see Figure 2). The example refers to using a 
car polishing machine in a garage. Starting point is a short 
video where learners see an employee operating the machine 
and explaining the most important do’s and don’ts, which 
comes close to “learning by observing”.  
Visual overlays to the video present key aspects, so that 
verbal or written text is not a main mode of presentation. The 
video integrates quiz questions with immediate feedback to 
allow learners to assess their progress. The example you see 
in Figure 2 is a visual true and false activity the angle at 
which the machine must be placed on the coating surface. 
Learners provide their answers by dragging the correct and 
the wrong option in the respective places.

Figure 2.  Example for micro-learning nugget 
A sidebar with four activity buttons was added to the 
video. The first refers back to the relevance of the topic. In 
our example, an infographic provides an aha moment, 
showing how expensive it can be if workers apply the 
polishing machine to the car at the wrong angle and cause 
scratches to the paint. The second button contains ideas for 
practice and experimentation at the workplace. The third 
button offers starting points to reflect about the topic of the 
learning content. Workers can hit the last button to provide 
feedback on the learning nugget (optional). The activity 
buttons remain displayed throughout the video, and learners 
can freely decide whether and when to use it. freely decide 
whether and when they make use of it or not.  
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
In the future, we need even more informal learning to 
support the tremendous level workforce upskilling as we 
face major transformation processes related to climate 
change, population aging as well as ongoing digitization and 
automation. However, many jobs offer limited opportunities 
for informal learning, in particular if human-human 
interaction is scarce, access to stationary desktop computers 
is difficult, and workers are less experienced in self-directed 
learning. In Section II, we have shown that the concept of 
MML closely overlaps with the characteristics of informal 
learning. 
The 
anytime-anywhere 
options 
of 
mobile 
technology might help to foster informal learning in 
learning-deprived work settings. However, there are barely 
some examples for MML programs launched for workers in 
blue-collar, non-academic fields. Drawing upon good 
practices in MML, this paper offers suggestions for the 
design and implementation of MML in such “atypical” 
settings.  
The proof-of-concept in Section III shows that based on a 
lightweight approach using a website with a simple CMS 
system, H5P interactive technology and QR codes, the 
design and distribution of short but engaging MML nuggets 
is achievable even for novices in the field of micro-learning 
and SME with limited resources for workforce training. 
Using short videos as a basis, placing visuals and animations

over “verbals”, designing stand-alone learning nuggets with 
integrated 
quizzes 
and 
other 
activities 
that 
foster 
experimentation and reflection should help to reduce barriers 
for learning, and to allow reaping the full benefits of MML 
for informal work-related learning – also in learning-
deprived settings.  
The approach suggested comes, however, with some 
drawbacks. Learning managers who design, curate and 
manage the learning nuggets may dislike the specific nature 
and structure of H5P content and the way authoring is 
organized in our lightweight approach. Furthermore, our 
approach is a self-hosted solution. Considering this, one 
might argue that a commercial micro-learning platform 
would be a more viable option. Indeed, platforms like EdApp 
[70] offer all needed functionality for our lightweight 
approach for MML even in its cost-free version (authoring 
tool for interactive micro-content, automated generation of 
QR codes). However, the size of video uploads is limited, 
and learners who wish to quickly access a micro-learning 
content might, however, dislike the fact that more clicks are 
needed for learning as compared to our scan-to-learn 
approach. Platforms like EdApp also require learners to 
register. 
Moreover, due to its anytime-anyplace nature, MML 
offers by nature only limited potential for learning through 
experimentation and practice at the workplace (“learning-by-
doing”) and even fewer opportunities for “social learning” 
through direct interaction in terms of observation, feedback, 
or help-seeking. When implementing MML for informal 
work-related learning, adequate instructional strategies 
should be adopted to – at least partly – make up for these 
drawbacks. Some authors point out that it is still an open 
question of how this can be best achieved [26]. Here we 
could argue that in the specific work context featured in this 
paper, social interaction is limited, anyway.  
The biggest challenge, however, in helping MML to 
spread in order to reap its full potential for informal learning 
at the workplace is the generation of content. Content 
creation can be cumbersome and is time-consuming. The 
production of one 5-minute learning nugget can cost € 5000 
or more if professionally produced [56]. The lightweight 
approach suggested in this paper tries to keep it as simple as 
possible for those designing MML instructional content. In 
this context, we also suggest to abstain from Virtual Reality 
or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) applications, even if 
advancements in mobile technology nowadays allow to 
implement AR-based MML at the workplace as shown by 
[71]. However, creating such learning nuggets is particularly 
challenging with little or no technical expertise in this field 
[72]. Indeed, the exemplary learning nugget has been 
produced in less than one hour (excluding video recording) 
thanks to the existing blueprint and the user-friendly 
authoring tool in the H5P plugin. The hope of the author of 
this paper is that the lightweight approach suggested and 
evaluated in a first proof-of-concept lowers the threshold for 
both – companies and learners from fields where learning 
while working with the help of digital and mobile 
technologies are not yet “daily business”. The “scan to learn” 
system also offers potential to implement lean onboarding 
processes.  
As a next step, the suggested approach should be 
implemented and evaluated in a real-life work setting, to 
identify potential improvements. Looking further, the 
integration of gamified elements and the use of augmented 
reality in the sense of “marker-based AR” [71] in MML will 
be promising paths to consider [71][72] – as soon as these 
rather complex technologies do not induce new barriers for 
companies and learners, in particular if companies are small 
and work is of rather non-academic nature.
