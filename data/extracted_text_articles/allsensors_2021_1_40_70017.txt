Abstract—A wireless sensor node with Wi-Fi interface has been
developed and applied to measure air quality parameters. The
node can be used for different indoor sensing applications, but
the currently addressed application context is to reduce the risk
of virus infection that is related to the aerosol concentration
in a room. As a helpful measure, the carbon dioxide (CO2)
concentration can be considered because there is a relation
between CO2 concentration and aerosol concentration. Two
different approaches of CO2 measurements, direct and indirect,
are tested. Captured data is wirelessly transmitted via Wi-Fi to
a database for detailed analysis. By using multiple sensor nodes,
a spatial distribution of CO2 can be calculated by using the
inverse distance weighting interpolation technique. The resulting
CO2 distribution data can be used to optimize the number of
required sensor nodes for a specific room and their placements.
Another aspect is the dynamics of the CO2 concentration when
ventilating the room, e.g., by opening windows to reduce the
aerosol concentration in a room. A single sensor node or multiple
nodes can be used to set up an alarm system that indicates
pending room ventilation in case of high CO2 concentration. A
set of five sensor nodes have been installed into a small room to
record CO2 concentration over time with a closed window and
when airing the room.

I. INTRODUCTION
Virus diseases like the pandemic Covid-19 require multiple
approaches to reduce the number of infections. One approach
is to filter infectious particles by optimized filter systems
in indoor scenarios but these systems can be difficult and
expensive to install. Another approach is to apply regular
room ventilation to reduce virus concentration. To optimize
this process, a measure can be helpful to identify the virus
concentration. For Covid-19 there is an expected relation
between virus concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and the
aerosol concentration because viruses are usually connected
to aerosols emitted during human’s breathing and speech.
But to directly measure the aerosol concentration is difficult.
It is much simpler to measure the carbon dioxide (CO2)
concentrations instead because current research has shown
a correlation between aerosol and CO2 concentrations [1].
Retrofitting existing buildings with modern Heating, Venti-
lation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems incorporating
automatic ventilation is a challenging task [2]. The exten-
sive use of CO2 sensors in classrooms and offices without
automatic HVAC systems could improve the ventilation habits
and therefore reduce the CO2 concentration and consequently
the concentration of potentially virus-contaminated aerosols.
CO2 sensors and related measurement systems can be easily
deployed in indoor scenarios. But it is usually necessary to
install more than a single sensor at different positions in a
room to get a realistic view of the CO2 concentration and
distribution in order to optimize ventilation frequency and
duration.
We propose a modular Sensor Node (SN) that enables the
deployment for different scenarios. The SN is built around the
self-designed IoTyze Wi-Fi module. A Nondispersive Infrared
(NDIR) CO2 and a Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) sensor
can be connected to the SN. The gathered data from the
connected sensors is buffered and transmitted via the Message
Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using a Wi-Fi
modem every 30 seconds. One use case is the local display
of the measured air quality parameters to support the regular
airing of the room. A display is connected to show the air
quality parameters. An optical and acoustical alert is triggered
if the air quality parameters reach a critical limit to indicate the
need for ventilation. The measured data is stored in a database
as evidence.
For a second application, a network of multiple SN is
deployed to measure the indoor spatial CO2 concentration.
The spatial CO2 concentration in classrooms is not uniformly
distributed, it depends on room geometry as well as on
the type of ventilation [3]. Experiments have shown that
the CO2 concentration in occupied space can be estimated
using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation if the
boundary conditions are known [5]. The concept was only
applied to simple room geometries. A network of multiple
SN could be used to experimentally determine the optimal
location for a single CO2 sensor inside complex structured
rooms (e.g., classrooms with many tables and chairs) without
the need for complex CFD simulations. This paper proposes a
method for interpolating the CO2 concentration measurements
that is tested with preliminary data recorded in home office.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the ar-
chitecture of the developed sensor node is described. This
includes hardware components, integrated sensors for CO2
measurement, and the data flow for storing the sensor data
in a database. The interfaces to access the sensor data locally
or remote via online display are introduced in Section 3. Also
comparisons are made for direct and indirect measurement of
CO2 concentration. Data analysis and spatial interpolation is
explained in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.

II. SENSOR NODE ARCHITECTURE
We propose the use of the IoTyze Wi-Fi board as the main
controller for the SN. This board combines a powerful STM32
Microcontroller (MCU), an ESP32 Wi-Fi System on Chip
(SoC) and additional periphery, as shown in Figure 1. One
of the sensors or both, i.e., SCD30 and BME680, can be
connected to the board. The display unit is an optional feature
if a local display is required. The IoTyze ecosystem provides a
software framework with a variety of different sensor drivers
and an easy-to-use file-based device configuration via USB
flash-drive emulation [4]. The use of a Wi-Fi modem supports
high transmission rates but requires an external power supply.
The LoRaWAN and LTE NB-IoT variants are not used because
of the limited bandwidth. A battery-supplied operation is not
considered because of the high current consumption of the
used sensors due to continuous measurements. The use of
a USB power supply for the sensor nodes is not a problem
anyway since the SNs are placed indoor at a fixed position.

A. Hardware
The IoTyze Wi-Fi board integrates an STM32L462 host
processor and an ESP32 SoC that executes the TCP/IP stack.
The communication between the host processor and the Wi-
Fi module is established using UART with a baud rate of
115200 bit/s. External oscillators are connected to the host
processor to provide precise timing. An I²C EEPROM is used
for storing the device configuration and status data. A micro
USB port is used to access the device configuration and for
the power supply. The board can also be supplied by using
a DC connector. The power rails, GPIOs, UART-, I²C- and
SPI-interfaces from the host processor are available through a
20 pin header. The sensors, including the optional display, are
connected to the controller board using this connector.
B. Air Quality Sensors
The main sensor device to estimate the aerosol concentration
is the Sensirion SCD30 sensor to measure the CO2 concentra-
tion because of the correlation between CO2 concentration and
aerosols. Furthermore, this sensor also measures temperature
and humidity. The device is connected to the host processor
using the I²C bus. The measurement of the CO2 concentration
is based on NDIR principles. The sample gas is irradiated by
a wideband light source and two photosensors with specific
passbands that measure the difference of a wavelength of
4.3 um, that is attenuated by CO2 molecules, compared to
a wavelength of 4 um, that is minimally absorbed by air
gases [6]. CO2 concentrations between 0 parts per million
(ppm) and 40000 ppm can be measured and the accuracy is
specified by 30 ppm or 3% [7]. The direct measurement of
CO2 concentration with an NDIR sensor is fairly expensive.
Furthermore, the SN can be equipped with a Bosch
BME680 VOC sensor. This sensor integrates four different
sensing principles for gas, humidity, pressure and temperature.
It has been optimized for IoT, home automation and control
and other applications. The VOC sensing is based on proven
sensing principles, i.e., depending on the type of gas that is
flowing along a heated metal-oxide surface different resulting
conductivities could be electrically measured [8]. A survey
of students has shown that the indoor comfort satisfaction
of students does not exclusively depend on CO2 concentra-
tion and that other micro-climate factors (e.g., temperature,
humidity, smell) must also be taken into account [9]. The
hotplate sensors measure a wider range of VOC pollutants,
e.g., outgassing from garbage, paint and furniture that is
processed by the integrated Bosch BSEC sensor fusion which
outputs the CO2 equivalent based on the correlation of VOC
and CO2 concentrations in humans exhaled breath [10]. The
data from the sensor fusion of the BME680 measurements can
be used as additional air quality parameters.
C. Data Flow
The proposed SN reads data from the connected sensors and
performs the required data preprocessing for transmission of
the buffered measurements as shown in Figure 2.

The CO2 concentration, temperature and humidity readings
from the SCD30 sensor with a sampling period of 2 seconds
are directly transferred into a circular FIFO buffer. The data
from the BME680 is processed by the proprietary Bosch
Sensortec Environmental Cluster (BSEC) sensor fusion library
[11]. The BSEC sensor fusion outputs virtual sensor values for
temperature, humidity, ambient pressure, Indoor Air Quality
(IAQ) and CO2 equivalent with a sampling period of 3 seconds
that is stored in the circular FIFO buffer. The circular FIFO
buffer is implemented around a nested C structure that is

generated by the Nanopb compiler from a payload description
[12]. The FIFO buffer is converted into the binary protocol
buffers data format using the Nanopb encoder. The binary
payload is transferred by a publish message using the MQTT
protocol. For the proposed sample application, the payload is
decoded and stored into an InfluxDB database by a Node-RED
instance. The data can be exported to a CSV formatted text
file for further processing and analysis.
III. AIR QUALITY DISPLAY
For the first application, the SN was equipped with a display
and a buzzer, as shown in Figure 3. The hardware is placed
inside a 3D printed case. The sensors are located at the back
of the case. An air-permeable cap is used as mechanical
protection. The device is supplied by an external 5V power
supply with a standard micro USB connector. The software
was developed for use with both, the SCD30 CO2 and the
BME680 VOC sensor, but also works with one of the sensors,
lacking the values of the disconnected device.
Fig. 3. Fully equipped sensor node
A. Local Display
The measured environmental parameters from the SCD30
sensor and the BSEC sensor fusion are additionally fed into an
air quality state management software module. This module
classifies the air quality based on the last CO2 reading, the
IAQ estimation and the assessments of the standard DIN EN
13779 [13]. The standard refers to CO2 concentrations above
the ambient level for classification. The globally averaged
CO2 concentration for the year 2019 was 410.5 ppm [14].
For simplicity, an ambient CO2 concentration of 400 ppm
was assumed. High air quality is assumed if both CO2
readings were below 950 ppm. For concentrations between 950
ppm and 1200 ppm air quality is considered sufficient. High
pollution with an immediate need for ventilation is assumed
if the CO2 concentration exceeds 1200 ppm. The higher CO2
reading is used for classification if both sensors are connected.
The current temperature, humidity, IAQ, CO2 (SCD30),
CO2 equivalent (BSEC) and the overall air quality assessment
are shown on a 4.3” TFT display, as shown in Figure 3.
An acoustic alert is triggered if the air quality exceeds a
critical limit. The local display should motivate the people
to periodically air the room. That way, the CO2 concentration
and thus also the expose of potentially infectious aerosols can
be kept below a critical level.
B. Online Display
The buffered sensor data is transmitted to an MQTT broker
using the ESP32 Wi-Fi modem every 30 seconds. For the air
quality display application, the data is stored in an InfluxDB
time-series database [16]. The stored data sets can be displayed
on a web dashboard using Grafana [17]. The actual CO2
measurements and the CO2 equivalent estimations from the
VOC measurements over a period of 4 days are shown in
Figure 4.

In the event of a revealed Covid infection, the recorded
data is possibly useful for a more accurate risk assessment to
prevent a further spread of the virus.
C. CO2 equivalent estimation
The NDIR CO2 sensors are significantly more expensive
compared to the VOC sensors. The estimated CO2 equivalent
from the BSEC sensor fusion is based on the assumption
of the presence of human breath only. For other sources of
CO2, the estimation will usually be too small, as shown in
Figure 4 for the time between Saturday midnight and noon.
The gas resistance measurement is sensitive to a wide range
of VOCs. Outgassing from furniture [18], detergents [19] or
personal care products [22] results in a higher total VOC
concentration, causing too high CO2 estimates. The spikes for
the CO2 estimations in Figure 4 likely result from such effects.
The cheap VOC sensor is therefore not capable of replacing
the actual NDIR sensor if accurate CO2 concentration values
are required. For the use in an air quality display, the sensor
could be suitable nevertheless because the readings determined
are usually too high if other VOC pollutants are present. In
this case, the airing of the room would be recommended
anyway. Especially, if a larger number of sensors nodes
should be deployed in large buildings to support air purity
and ventilation, a significant price advantage of the BME680
becomes obvious.

IV. SPATIAL CO2 CONCENTRATION
Objective of the proposed SN is the reduction of aerosol
concentration indoors by indicating high CO2 concentrations.
In case of detection of high CO2 concentration, room ventila-
tion should be performed for a specific time. But the structure
of a room and the localisation of windows and doors affect
the aerosol distribution [21] and therefore the efficiency of
ventilation in terms of local reduction of aerosol concentra-
tions. As solution, multiple sensor nodes can be deployed to
measure the CO2 concentration at different locations inside
a room. The use of multiple SNs helps to measure aerosol
concentration in badly ventilated room corners and regions
away from a window to optimize the ventilation frequency and
duration and therefore to lower the aerosol concentration in all
parts of a room. Theoretically, it is also possible to estimate
the indoor aerosol distribution by mathematically modeling
[20], but this is too complex for the proposed application,
especially when equipping several rooms with sensor nodes.
As experimental approach, multiple sensor nodes have been
placed at different locations inside a room to get the spatial
CO2 concentration. The measured data was used to visualize
and evaluate the air exchange during ventilation in order to
optimize the ventilation process. This set-up could further be
used to determine the optimal location for a single air quality
display in typical room structures.
A. Experimental Setup
Due to the current Covid situation, it was not possible to
perform measurements under realistic conditions with many
humans being in a room like a university lecture hall. There-
fore, preliminary data was recorded in the home office with
a limited area of 19 m². The layout of the room is shown in
Figure 5. SN 1 is placed on a TV rack in front of the room.
SN 2 is placed on the upper side of the desk near a window.
SN 3 is located in the opposite direction of the desk. SN 4 is
mounted in a nested corner of the room. SN 5 is located near
the door. All sensors are placed at a height of 1.5 m to limit
the interpolation to 2 dimensions. The experiment begins with
the door and all windows closed in order to demonstrate the
effect of ventilation.
The time between the shown measurements was determined
experimental in a way to best demonstrate the effect of airing
and the rise of CO2 concentration after closing the window.
First measurements of CO2 concentrations are performed just
before the door and window a are opened. After 30 seconds
the next measurements are taken. The door and the window
are closed after 5 minutes of open time and a last set of
measurements are acquired after additional 5 minutes.
B. Interpolation
The measured CO2 concentrations are interpolated on a
plane, representing a cross-section of the room. One challenge
of the spatial interpolation for this application is the limited
number of supporting points. The few measurement locations
are further not placed on a regular grid. Basic multivariant
interpolation techniques, e.g., bilinear interpolation, rely on a

regular grid, which is why these methods are not suitable for
this application [23]. Methods from geostatistics, e.g., kriging
or inverse distance weighting (IDW) can be used with irregular
distributed data. Kriging is a commonly used geostatistical
approach assuming a spatial correlation between the sample
points [24]. The data from the five SNs is not sufficient to
create a meaningful variogram. Therefore, the deterministic
IDW approach was used for interpolation. The estimated value
is calculated by the values and distances to all sampled points,
as shown in Equation 1 [25]. The weighting of each sample
point only depends on the distance raised to the power of µ,
neglecting the unknown spatial correlation. The interpolation
points can only take values between the minima and maxima
of the support points.

C. Results
Figure 6 shows the spatial CO2 concentration at a height of
1.5 m before the experiment is started. The CO2 concentration
is almost identical at all measuring points (1416-1466 ppm)
except for position 1 that is located near the door with 1239
ppm. Fresh air flowing through the gap underneath the door
could explain the drop in CO2 concentration at this sampling
point.
The measurements recorded 30 seconds after opening the
door and window a are shown in Figure 7. Fresh air is
flowing through window a in direction of the door. The CO2
concentration near the window is 468 ppm whereas in the
corner of the room at position 4 still 1302 ppm is measured.
Shortly after the start of airing, a concentration drop is visible

Fig. 6. Spatial CO2 concentration just before airing (t = 0)
in the direction of the window. The sensor readings measured
at position 2 near the window are also fluctuating while the
window is open. The airing results in a noticeable pulsating
airflow near the window, causing a temporal variation of CO2
concentration near the window. Total airing time is 5 minutes.
Fig. 7. Spatial CO2 concentration after (t = 30 s) seconds airing
The last measurements taken 5 minutes after the window
a and the door were closed are shown in Figure 8. The CO2
concentration now settles between 664 ppm at position 1 near
the door and 983 ppm at position 3 at the corner of the desk.
The measurement at position 2 in the opposite direction of
the desk near the window is 839 ppm. The CO2 concentration
in the immediate environment of the workplace is already
increasing after a short time when working at this place.
To have an efficient result of the ventilation, i.e., low CO2
concentration in all regions of a room, multiple sensor nodes
should be used to get a detailed view of the CO2 distribution.
Fig. 8. Spatial CO2 concentration 5 minutes after the end of airing, i.e., at
time t = (5 + 5) min
Here, a simple guideline should be developed where to
place the sensors in the room for typical room structures. In
the proposed scenarios the sensors are wirelessly connected
to a database. Future postprocessing of the recorded sensor
data including visualization can be used to optimize number
and position of sensors in a room. Result can be a guideline
for e.g., facility managers to optimize SN deployment in
different rooms and to reduce infection risk by keeping aerosol
concentrations at reasonable low levels.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The deployment of the proposed air quality sensor with local
display and alert functionality supports the ventilation habits
to keep the room CO2 concentration below a critical limit. The
online data logging could serve as an indicator for the infection
risk in case of a detected Covid infection. The estimated CO2
equivalent from the BSEC sensor fusion is not as accurate
as the directly measured value from the NDIR sensor but it
is still sufficient as a rough indicator of the air quality. The
BME680 sensor could be used for a low-cost variant of the
sensor node, as the values are estimated rather too high. Due
to the cost-efficiency of the SN, multiple of these nodes can
be used in a single room to get a good view of spatial CO2
concentration.
The spatial distribution of the CO2 concentration as well
as its dynamic change has been recorded in small room
during an airing period. Right at the beginning of the airing
a concentration gradient originating from the window was
observed. In the direct vicinity of the workplace, an increased
CO2 concentration is already detected shortly after the airing
was stopped. From the preliminary data it can be concluded
that the well-elaborated location of a single CO2 sensor inside
the room is highly relevant. The positioning near doors and
windows is not recommended because of possible draught
resulting in too low measurement values not representing high
CO2 concentrations as they may remain in isolated or nested
regions of a room. If it is not possible to use multiple sensors,
a single sensor should be placed further inside the room close

to the workplaces or in room corner with some distance to a
window.
In future work, measurements have to be performed under
real conditions in crowded lecture rooms and halls. Due to the
current Covid restrictions, experiments under those conditions
were not possible so far. It has to be analyzed how many
sensor nodes should be used for typical room structures in
order to have a cost-efficient but still safe solution to measure
CO2 concentration as basis to start the ventilation process. A
planning tool could be developed that automatically calculates
the number and positioning of sensor nodes inside a room.
Database for this approach is the recorded sensor data captured
in the planning phase when for a set-up time more nodes
than required are used in a room to get sufficient sensor data
from different regions of a room. As part of this planning
tool, the interpolation quality has to be analyzed. The adjusted
inverse distance weighting (AIDW) interpolation could be used
to account for shielding effects resulting from space-dividing
elements [26]. Furthermore, the used IDW approach could be
compared to other interpolation techniques (e.g., radial basis
functions [27]) to determine the best fitting method for spatial
distribution of CO2 in occupied space. The final planning tool
can be an interactive graphical tool representing room structure
and placement of sensors and optionally extended by dynamic
sensor data visualization for analysis options.
