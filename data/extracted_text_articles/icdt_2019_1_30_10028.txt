networks in Romania is also discussed. Finally, we propose, in 
the framework of an ongoing research project, a preliminary 
architecture for a spectrum occupancy evaluation system.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
As the requirements in terms of data rate are ever 
increasing along with the expansion of the multimedia and 
wireless communications markets, the forthcoming fifth 
generation of mobile communication networks (5G) will 
have to provide significantly higher values for capacity, data 
rate and number of connected devices as compared to the 
current generation (4G). Moreover, several major user 
scenarios are defined for 5G, including enhanced Mobile 
Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency 
Communications (URLLC) and massive Machine Type 
Communications (mMTC) [1]. 
However, several challenges will have to be faced in 
order to obtain the above-mentioned performance goals. A 
key problem that must be solved is related to the limited 
frequency resources that are currently available, because of 
the fixed allocation policy and the large number of wireless 
communication standards that require spectrum resources.  
The current state of 5G New Radio (NR) standardization 
includes a first version of the standard developed by 3GPP 
(Rel. 15), both in terms of non-standalone network operation 
(specifications were concluded in December 2017) [2], and 
in the case of standalone network operation (the 
specifications in this case were concluded in June 2018) [3]. 
The development of a new release (Rel. 16) already started 
and is expected to be concluded before the end of 2019. 
The current paper focuses on the physical layer of the 
forthcoming generation of mobile communication networks. 
The main contributions of the article are a review of the 
unlicensed spectrum access elements in case of mobile 
communication networks and a proposal of a spectrum 
occupancy evaluation system. The proposed system is based 
on the use of Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms and 
brings novelties over state-of-the-art by combining SDR 
platforms with different characteristics and by using 
optimized spectrum sensing algorithms.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
contains a review of the various radio technologies that were 
considered for the implementation of the radio interface in 
5G networks. Section III discusses the frequency bands that 
are foreseen to be used for 5G networks. In Section IV, 
several aspects regarding the use of unlicensed spectrum 
resources in the context of 5G networks are presented. A 
preliminary architecture of a spectrum occupancy evaluation 
system is proposed in Section V. Section VI concludes the 
paper and contains future research directions.

RADIO TECHNOLOGIES CONSIDERED FOR THE RADIO 
INTERFACE IN 5G NETWORKS 
As with all the other generations of mobile networks, the 
requirements imposed for 5G networks are ever increasing. 
In Table I, a comparison between the performances that can 
be obtained using the current 4G networks and the ones that 
are expected for the upcoming 5G networks. 
As it can be noticed, the requirements in case of the 
upcoming 5G networks are significantly higher compared to 
the ones for the existing 4G networks.

Several radio technologies are considered for the 
implementation of the air interface within the future 5G 
networks. These technologies, which are seen as appropriate 
in order to achieve the performances specified in the 3GPP 
standard (see Table I), can be grouped into several categories 
as follows:  
• Multi-carrier technologies such as CP-OFDM [4], 
Windowed OFDM (WOFDM) [5], Unique-Word OFDM 
(UW-OFDM) [6], Discrete Fourier Transform-Spread 
OFDM [7];  
• Single carrier technologies such as Continuous Phase 
Modulation - Single Carrier - FDMA (CPM-SC-FDMA) [8] 
[9], Differential Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (DQAM) 
[10]; 
• other technologies such as Bi-Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (B-OFDM) [11], Filter Bank Multi-
carrier (FBMC) [12], Generalized Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (GFDM) [13], Universal Filtered Multicarrier 
(UFMC) [14]. 
III. 
FREQUENCY BANDS FORSEEN TO BE USED IN 5G 
NETWORKS 
The current allocation of frequency resources for the 
existing mobile communication networks (2G, 3G, 4G) 
comprises of various frequency bands, all of them being 
located below 4 GHz. In Figure 1, the allocation of spectrum 
resources for the case of Romania is presented, as given in 
[15] by the National Authority for Management and 
Regulation in Communications of Romania (ANCOM).  
In terms of frequency bands expected to be used in future 
5G networks, two main categories are defined as follows: 
• 
Frequency bands below 6 GHz (FR1); 
• 
Frequency bands between 24.25 GHz and 52.6 GHz 
(FR2). 
For the particular case of Romania, the same national 
strategy for 5G [15] also mentions the frequency bands to be 
used in future 5G networks for which a call for tender will be 
held in the second half of 2019: 
• The 3.4-3.8 GHz frequency band, which is considered 
by the RSPG (public consultation group on radio spectrum 
allocation policy at European Commission level) to be the 
most suitable for immediate use by 5G networks [16] [17]; 
• The frequencies in the 700 MHz band, which are 
suitable for the development of 5G network coverage over 
extended areas, due to lower radio frequency attenuation. For 
this band the existing infrastructure is expected to be used; 
• The 24.25-27.5 GHz frequency band, which can offer 
bandwidths of the hundreds of MHz required to achieve the 
performance specified in [2] and [3] (speeds up to 20 Gbps 
under stable conditions for mobile users). 
IV. 
ASPECTS REGARDING ACCESS IN UNLICENSED 
FREQUENCY BANDS IN 5G NETWORKS 
Considering the fact that several wireless communication 
systems appeared in the last decades and they all required 
frequency resources, spectrum allocation became a critical 
aspect in recent years. However, several measurement 
campaigns that were conducted worldwide [18] clearly 
shown that most of the spectrum is currently used in a very 
inefficient way. We also conducted measurement campaigns 
in Romania [19] and obtained spectrum occupancy values 
going all the way down to less than 15% in rural areas. One 
possible approach for improving the efficiency of spectrum 
usage would be to allow the access of different wireless 
communication systems in unlicensed bands or in bands 
licensed to other systems, as long as the licensed (Primary) 
system/User (PU) is not active.

Such an approach, known as Dynamic Spectrum Access 
(DSA) or Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) requires that 
each equipment that accesses such a frequency band 
continuously scans the spectrum, process known as 
Spectrum Sensing (SS), in order to detect a possible activity 
of the PU. As soon as such an activity is detected, the 
unlicensed (Secondary) User (SU) should immediately cease 
its activity in that frequency band, in order to avoid any 
interference with the PU. 
Starting 
with 
the 
fourth 
generation 
of 
mobile 
communication networks (4G), standardization efforts 
focused on the possibility of allowing users to access both 
licensed and unlicensed spectrum under a unified network 
infrastructure. The LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) technology 
was initiated as part of LTE Release 13 in order to obtain the 
above-mentioned goal [20]. 
Another 
LTE-based 
technology 
which 
operates 
standalone in unlicensed and shared spectrum is MulteFire 
[21]. The MulteFire specification was developed by the 
MulteFire Alliance, an independent, diverse and international 
member-driven consortium. Based on 3GPP Release 13 and 
14, MulteFire technology supports Listen-Before-Talk for 
fair co-existence with Wi-Fi and other technologies 
operating in the same spectrum. It supports private LTE and 
neutral host deployment models and targets industrial IoT, 
enterprise, cable, and various other vertical markets. 
A study regarding NR-based access to unlicensed 
spectrum was started by 3GPPP in 2018 [22] and has as goal 
the development of a single global solution for NR-based 
access to unlicensed spectrum, which should be compatible 
with the NR concepts.  
Several regulatory requirements for the 5GHz frequency 
band are being mentioned for all the different ITU Regions, 
including Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS). DFS is a 
spectrum-sharing mechanism that allows the coexistence of 
wireless LANs with radar systems by automatically selecting 
a frequency that does not interfere with certain radar systems 
while operating in the 5 GHz band. The DFS concept was 
first introduced in 2001 and is a feature that is present in the 
ETSI BRAN HIPERLAN/2 and IEEE Standard 802.11h. 
For the case of the upcoming NR-Unlicensed (NR-U) 
standard, it appears that a DFS conformance testing would 
only have to be performed for the Base Station (BS), as full 
DFS functionality doesn’t have to be implemented in all 
devices, but only in those controlling the transmission. 
Different unlicensed bands or shared bands have been 
discussed for the NR-U, such as 2.4 GHz band, 3.5 GHz 
band, 5 GHz band, and 6 GHz band. Some of these 
frequency bands are available globally, whereas some of the 
bands are only available in some specific regions.  
Although in [22] only the case of the 5GHz band is 
discussed in detail, the same principles will be applicable to 
a set of frequency ranges to be further defined, without any 
prioritization for any particular unlicensed band. However, 
unlicensed bands below 1GHz are not targeted, due to the 
lack of spectrum in that range, which would make an 
efficient NR-U operation impossible. 
V. 
PRELIMINARY ARCHITECTURE OF A SPECTRUM 
OCCUPANCY EVALUATION SYSTEM 
In the following year, in the framework of the Spectrum-
5G research project, our research team intends to conduct 
several measurement campaigns in order to evaluate the 
spectrum occupancy in urban and rural areas of Romania. 
We intend to collect RF data for a frequency range up to 6 
GHz and for long time periods, in order to obtain a relevant 
picture of the current spectrum occupancy status. A 
preliminary architecture of the system that we intend to 
design and use for performing the measurements is 
presented in Figure 2. 
As it can be noticed, the system is based on the use of 
several SDR platforms as capture devices. The radio 
frequency signal is captured by means of a broadband 
antenna (frequency range of at least up to 6 GHz), which is 
then distributed to multiple SDR platforms via a broadband 
radiofrequency power splitter. The SDR platforms will 
monitor different frequency bands, selected through filtering 
circuits. 
For higher frequency bands, Low Noise Amplifiers 
(LNA) will be added to increase the level of detected signals 
in order to obtain improved performance in the spectrum 
sensing process. As it can be seen in Figure 2, the SDR 
platforms targeted for the system implementation will be: 
• USRP X310 (with UBX-160 RF daughterboard) – 
Frequency 
range 
10-6000 
MHz; 
Maximum 
instantaneous bandwidth 160 MHz; Host interface – 10 
Gbit ethernet; 
• USRP N210 (with WBX RF daughterboard) – 
Frequency 
range 
50-2200 
MHz; 
Maximum 
instantaneous bandwidth 40 MHz; Host interface – 1 
Gbit ethernet; 
• USRP B200mini – Frequency range 70-6000 MHz; 
Maximum instantaneous bandwidth 56 MHz; Host 
interface – USB 3.0; 
• HackRF One – Frequency range 1-6000 MHz; 
Maximum instantaneous bandwidth 20 MHz; Host 
interface – USB 2.0.

The information from the SDR platforms will then be 
centralized using a high-performance server, this approach 
enabling the simultaneous acquirement of data from 
different frequency bands. From a software point of view, 
we intend to use the GNU Radio environment to control and 
capture the data from SDR platforms, and the MATLAB 
environment for estimating the degree of occupancy of the 
spectrum based on collected data using different spectrum 
sensing 
algorithms. 
We 
already 
developed 
several 
algorithms based on energy detection [23], which will be 
used alongside classical algorithms like [24]. Although in 
the current paper the case of Romania is discussed in detail, 
the flexibility of the proposed system will allow its use for 
analyzing the spectrum occupancy for any other country.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The paper presented several aspects regarding the 
physical layer of the upcoming fifth generation of mobile 
communication networks. The candidate radio technologies 
that are considered for the implementation of the air interface 
were mentioned, together with the frequency bands that are 
foreseen to be used for covering all the different use 
scenarios covered by 5G networks. A review of the different 
aspects related to the access in unlicensed frequency band is 
also performed. A preliminary architecture of a spectrum 
occupancy evaluation system, based on several software 
defined radio platform, is finally proposed. As future work, 
we intend to implement, in the framework of the Spectrum-
5G research project, the previously described architecture 
and we intend to use it for performing measurement 
campaigns in several urban and rural areas in Romania.
