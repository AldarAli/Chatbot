Abstract—Our software application eALIS2.1 (just like 
eALIS1.1) is primarily intended to supply linguists with a 
highly intelligent device to build fragments of languages. On 
the basis of the fragments, (non-linguist) experts can elaborate 
a peculiarly “multiplied” database that offers, besides the 
model of the external world, hundreds of its (appropriately 
labeled) alternatives. According to the eALIS theoretical 
framework that we use (eALIS: Reciprocal and Lifelong 
Interpretation System), these alternative models can all be 
linked to simulated human agents (addressers and addressees 
of possible discourses), who are represented in the world model 
as conglomerates of their pieces of knowledge, beliefs, desires, 
and intentions. Finally, (further) users can select lexical items 
to build sentences, the truth-conditional interpretation of 
which the program can calculate on the basis of the actual 
version of the above-sketched “multiplied world model”. It 
performs this after checking whether the given sentences can 
serve as felicitous expositive speech acts in realistic on-going 
discourses. Our software application serves not only the 
theoretical purpose of testing eALIS as a Discourse-
Representation-Theory-based “pragmalinguistics” approach 
(by implementing it), but it also serves the practical purpose of 
collecting and systematizing data in the peculiar structure that 
eALIS offers. It is a crucial feature of eALIS that it is 
intended to truly capture human intelligence (more precisely, 
such sapiens-specific components of long-term memory as 
episodic memory, with its space-time coordinates, and 
semantic memory, containing context-free knowledge). 
Keywords—dynamic discourse semantics; possible worlds; 
truth-conditional interpretation; speech acts; presupposition. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
We are working on the implementation of a pragma-
linguistics theory, eALIS, intended to truly capture human 
intelligence by means of a peculiarly multiplied world 
model [1] [2] [3]. We consider the implementation of this 
“intelligent” structure [4] [5] [6] our primary innovation. 
The point of departure to our research work is a 
linguistics theory whose representatives, in the course of 
describing human language(s) and explaining their structure 
and functioning, have been led to a conclusion that may 
seem to be quite strange at first glance: revealing the 
“internal” secrets of language (including non-pragmatic and 
non-cognitive phenomena as well) depends on the 
substantial capturing of an external factor. This factor is 
information states of human minds in communication, 
changing from second to second [7] [8]. It is this factor that 
must be modeled in a way that we can account for the facts 
that we are interlocutors reciprocally “reflecting” each 
other’s minds [9] [10] [11] and that our momentary 
information states contain even pieces of information 
obtained decades earlier. In essence, it is the human mind 
itself that is to be modeled according to special aspects and 
requirements [12] [13]. 
Is this a huge cost for the treatment of internal questions 
of language? 
Our answer is ‘no’ to this question, because it is possible 
to elaborate a sufficiently simple plausible mathematical 
model [3] (see Section III). The promising benefit, however, 
opens up new prospects in two fields, in which we intend to 
continue to conduct research, besides linguistic phenomena 
in a narrow sense of the term. One field is basing the 
innumerable kinds of computational processing of human 
language upon data arranged according to human 
intelligence or the “model of minds in communication” [11] 
[14] [15]. The other field has to do with the scientific 
description of mental disorders: it is via inspecting the 
impaired mind, on the one hand, that we can approach to 
understanding the driving forces for language, and, on the 
other hand, it is via studying language that the decisive 
features of autism or schizophrenia, for instance, can be 
captured [16]. In the neuropsychiatric field of our research, 
we explain what causes information loss and deficiency in 
these conditions [17].  
After sketching this broad picture, we restrict ourselves, 
in what follows, to dealing with the pragmalinguistics [5], 
mathematical [3] and “technical” [18] [19] [20] apparatus of 
eALIS, which makes its implementation immediately 
possible. 
Let us now overview the structure of the paper. Section 
II sketches the current version of eALIS, primarily its 
radical ontological innovation relative to Discourse 
Representation Theory (DRT [21] [22]), which underlies it. 
Then the decisive elements of the mathematical definition of 
eALIS are presented, in Section III. Section IV is devoted 
to the demonstration of the new results in pragmatics in the 
eALIS framework, which have strengthened our earlier 
guideline. The point is that in the case of an utterance, it is 
to be checked whether the speaker, the hearer and the given 
situation are suitable for serving as the addresser, the 
addressee and the context of the linguistically defined 
speech act [23] [24], which simply requires a truth-
conditional investigation [25] primarily into the addresser’s 
mind’s certain “worldlets”. The task boils down to get to the 
worldlets in which certain polarity values must then be 
checked. Then our software application eALIS1.1 is

demonstrated in Section V through discussing its different 
kinds of potential users and its main use cases for the users 
we call internal users and for those we call external users. 
Section VI demonstrates the analysis of some linguistic 
examples with the purpose of elucidating our ambition to 
capture the highest possible level of human intelligence 
coded in language. It is presented how our generalized truth 
evaluation can be applied to such complicated linguistic 
phenomena as tense, aspect, subjectivity, deixis, among 
others. Finally, Section VII presents the additional services 
of eALIS2.1 as compared to eALIS1.1 and an SDRT-
based (Segmented DRT [22])) experimental software 
application called RUDI [26].  We point out that eALIS2.1 
can be regarded as a model of the two parts of long-term 
memory―episodic and semantic memory―and this enables 
us to derive a potentially infinite number of senses for 
words from finite lexical resources.  
II. 
THE CURRENT VERSION OF EALIS AND THE “STATE 
OF THE ART” 
eALIS is based on Discourse Representation Theory, 
often referred to as DRT [27] [28]; it can thus be introduced 
as belonging to the family of representational dynamic dis-
course 
semantics. 
Its 
complete 
(forty-page-long 
mathematical) definition is available at [2]; the relevant 
details will be given in Section III. It is intended in eALIS 
to reconcile the formal exactness of generative syntaxes [29] 
[30] [31] (and their adaptations to Hungarian [32] [33] [34]) 
and the dynamic approach of optimality theories [35] and 
the aforementioned (S)DRT with basically Austinian [36] 
speech-act theories [37] [38], bearing in mind the holistic 
stance of cognitive linguists [39] [40]. 
In the post-Montagovian world [25] of formal semantics, 
DRT―which has offered a revolutionary logics-based 
solution to the resolution problem of (“donkey”) anaphora 
and 
attractive 
visual 
representations 
for 
discourse 
meaning―is often criticized from “inside” as well as from 
“outside”, considerably weakening its legitimacy. The 
internal criticism comes from the world of the dynamic 
model-theoretic semantics, from the Amsterdam School 
[41], and pertains to the (mathematically unquestionable) 
eliminability of exactly this attractive visual representation, 
insisting on “Montague’s heritage” [25]. The external 
criticism comes from experts of philosophy /pragmatics [42] 
and representatives of the Proof-Theoretic School [43], 
among others [44]; they all point at the dubious status and 
construction of possible worlds (among others). 
Pollard [44], for instance, is led to the following 
conclusion pertaining to the mainstream Kripke/Montague-
inspired possible-worlds semantics: “the idea of taking 
worlds as a primitive of semantic theory is a serious 
misstep.” He calls it [44] “a framework known to have 
dubious foundations.” 
Even the seminal book of teaching Montague Grammar 
[25] admits these “dubious foundations” in the course of 
discussing the problem of necessity and possibility: “Would 
this be an enlightening way of analyzing the semantics of 
necessity [e.g., Alfred must be a bachelor] and possibility 
[e.g., Alfred may be a bachelor]? Many philosophers of 
language have unequivocally answered “no” to this 
question; they have contended that since “possible worlds” 
are surely vague and ill-understood entities..., it cannot help 
to explain one mysterious semantic concept (necessity) in 
terms of an even more mysterious one (possible worlds).” 
The same is still “reported” in 2014. 
Judge [45], for instance, who works in the standard, 
Kratzerian [46] [47] framework of modality (based on the 
Kripke/Montague-inspired 
possible-worlds 
semantics), 
“admits” that “describing the semantics of uncertainty is 
problematic – particularly for semantic theories that are 
reliant on truth-conditional definitions of meaning;” and she 
designates the pertinent relationship between formal 
semantics and pragmatics as follows: “...ideally a linguistic 
theory will account for how natural language works in real 
conversational contexts, and not be restricted to only 
accounting for logical output, (not least because extricating 
the core/logical meaning of a linguistic expression from the 
contributions of context is highly problematic). Indeed, 
modality is an area of semantics where understanding the 
systematic interactions of context and underlying form is 
particularly pertinent.”  Note that Judge’s evaluation even 
on her own solution proposed in [45] is definitely low-key: 
“The proposal of the certainty set is intended as an 
experiment, rather than a full-blown, conclusive solution to 
the puzzles of modal expressions. By refashioning the 
knowledge set as a certainty set some interesting patterns 
and solutions are suggested. However, problems remain 
particularly with characterising degrees of modality, the 
epistemic 
modality/ 
evidential” 
distinction, 
[among 
others]...” 
Marsali 
[42], 
whose 
approach 
is 
philosophical 
/pragmatic, “...refuses to adopt the semantic account of 
EMM [epistemic modality markers, such as maybe, 
probably, certainly, definitely] on the ground of ... [the 
reason that] it is not clear how EMM should be interpreted, 
and countless incompatible semantic accounts of EMM have 
been presented in the philosophical literature ... But it is 
implausible to contend that EMM fix the truth conditions of 
[say, a] statement like Certainly it is raining in England, if 
there is no agreement on what are the truth conditions of [a 
statement like this].” 
It is also worth mentioning on the basis of [7] that “221 
may be a good choice” is as reasonable a reaction to the 
proposal “We need a prime number greater than 200” as the 
reaction “211 may be a good choice,” in contrast to the 
unreasonable reaction “300 may be a good choice.” The 
problem (for possible-worlds semantics) is that 211 is a 
prime number, indeed, while 221=1317. There is no 
possible world, thus, in which 221 is a prime number (or, in 
an absurd system of possible worlds, even 300 can qualify 
as a prime number).  
We claim that eALIS―while considerably relying on 
the representationalism of DRT in the course of solving a 
wide range of linguistic problems in order to maximally 
exploit and develop the excellent facilities provided by this 
representationalism―offers exactly the radical ontological 
innovation that has to do with the elimination of the above-

mentioned two dubious levels of representation, discourse 
representations and possible worlds, referred to as I and III 
in Fig. 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Components / levels of representation in DRT: I-IV; 
and their re-arranged ontology in eALIS: 
I. DRS: the semantic representation of sentences constituting coherent texts 
II. Model of the external world (for extensional interpretation) 
III. Possible worlds (for intensional interpretation) 
IV. Interlocutors’ information states 
eALIS embeds representational levels I and III―more 
exactly, their relevant content―in the representation of 
information states (IV), relying on the approach that, as 
interlocutors obtain information through discourses, their 
information states are worth regarding as gigantic, lifelong, 
DRSs. An information state has a double nature: it functions 
as a “representation” in the above regard while it is used as 
“what is to be represented” in the interpretation of, say, the 
intensional sentence types shown in (2b-d): it also depends 
on different persons’ information states whether these 
sentences are true, in contrast to sentence (2a), the truth 
value of which only depends on facts of the external world. 
Note in passing about the aforementioned “double nature of 
information states” that modern set theory exactly rests 
upon a similar idea: Sets and their elements must not be 
mixed up; this does not mean, however, that a set could not 
serve as an element of another set. 
a. “Ben is a linguist.” 
b. “Sue knows that/if [Ben is a linguist]” 
c. “Joe guesses that Sue definitely wants to convince him to take it for granted 
that [Ben is a linguist].” 
Figure 2.  Sentences to be interpreted in different world(let)s. 
We are now going to illustrate the descriptive and 
explanatory 
power 
of 
eALIS 
by 
sketching 
the 
interpretation of sentence (3a), featuring realize, which is a 
factive verb (NB: similar analyses of ours are available in 
[8] and [7]). Hence, it is a precondition of interpreting the 
sentence as true (or rather, as “well-formed”) that the 
Evening Star must coincide with the Morning Star in (the 
model of) the external world. This means that the entity 
referred to as the Evening Star by the given astronomer 
must be the same entity he refers to as the Morning Star. In 
the approach of eALIS, this relation is captured formally 
as demonstrated in (3b): the internal entity rEveningStar must be 
anchored to the same external entity as the internal entity 
rMorningStar. 
 
 
Figure 3.  The interpretation of realize and the Venus-problem 
a. “An ancient astronomer realized that the Evening Star is the same as the 
Morning Star.” 
b. (rEvSt) is-the-same-as (rMoSt) (since uVenus is-the-same-as uVenus) 
c. It does not hold that rEveningStar is-the-same-as rMorningStar at  in the 
astronomer’s worldlet of astronomic hypotheses 
d. It holds that rEveningStar is-the-same-as rMorningStar at ', which is a later point 
of time in the astronomer’s worldlet of astronomic hypotheses 
The astronomer himself is not (necessarily) aware of the 
co-anchoring of the two internal entities at his disposal (in 
his appropriate worldlet); but the fact of co-anchoring is an 
external requirement due to the factive character of the verb. 
Two further requirements to be satisfied in order for 
sentence (3a) to qualify as true concern two information 
states of the astronomer at different points of time, 
independently of the external world: what is to be checked 
is whether there is a “same-as” relation between the internal 
entity rEveningStar and the internal entity rMorningStar in the one 
information state (3d) while they do not stand in the “same-
as” relation in the other one (3c) 
All in all, three competing world(let) models need to be 
considered simultaneously (“prism effect”), and three 
entities―an external one and two internal ones―need to be 
inspected. As the three models are all parts of the one 
complete model of the history of the external world and all 
internal reflections associated with it (see Fig. 2), in this 
matrix model (3b-d) can all be checked. 
It must be noted that the analysis relies on the same 
facilities available in the cognitive linguistics framework; 
see, for instance, the paper by Pelyvás [39], who follows 
Langacker’s approach to nominal grounding [48]. The most 
important tenet of this view is that all nominals are 
grounded in the “reality” of the Idealized Conceptual 
Model(s) evoked in the discourse, which is relative to 
speaker and hearer, rather than directly in objective reality. 
From the point of view of linguistic analysis the reality that

we could call “objective” (i.e., independent of speakers’ and 
hearers’ beliefs) is only of marginal importance. 
At this point we call the reader’s attention to the obvious 
fact that our treatment of replacing, in the course of truth-
conditional interpretation, a set of possible worlds with the 
finite (and typically very small) “worldlet” containing the 
information shared by the given possible worlds opens up 
new prospects in (the practice of) implementation. With 
gigantic sets of gigantic possible worlds got rid of, there is 
already no obstacle to capturing the pragmatic complexity 
that is claimed to be associated with even simple assertions, 
which “serve the aim of communicating, not merely pieces 
of information, but also the speaker’s attitude of certainty or 
uncertainty about them,” [38] chiefly due to what are called 
the ATMM-categories: Aspect [49], Tense, Mood, and 
(different kinds of) Modality [38] (see also [40], Section 4 
in [24], and Section IV-D in the present paper). 
We conclude this section by telling some words on the 
“state of the art”. At the moment, we only have world 
models and alternative-worldlet-set models filled up with 
small sets of data. Our sophisticated Hungarian lexicon also 
consists of not more than a few hundreds of words [51] [52]  
[53], and our English lexicon is even smaller; furthermore, 
the involvement of these lexical items in parsing [54] also 
requires 
highly 
theory-specific 
morphological 
[55], 
syntactic [57] [56] [58], and semantic [1] [58] [60] tools. 
Thus, we are in an experimental phase with our software 
applications. The problem is that it would require very much 
time, effort, and, hence, money, to elaborate realistic and 
useful world(let) models. We are also in need of native 
speakers of English who are willing to help elaborating such 
sophisticated linguistic descriptions as the Hungarian ones 
presented in Section IV-D, for instance. 
It would be worth elaborating all these costly 
components if, and only if, such customers appeared in the 
market who are willing to make our team register the data 
they work with and the environment they work in according 
to the peculiar system that eALIS offers. We mean data 
that someone actually works with. The primary aim with this 
paper is to find such customers. Not only for obtaining 
financial support for our team of theoretical and 
computational linguists, most importantly for obtaining 
realistic conglomerates of data worth working up in the ways 
demonstrated in this paper. 
We intend to convince the reader (and our potential 
customers) that not only professional spies, intrigants and 
mind readers are in need of maniulating data registered in 
multiplied wordlet structures but also detectives, lawyers and 
judges are, as well as managers and secretaries, psychiatrists 
and politicians, and practically everyone. It is no coincidence 
that every human language is well equipped with such 
communication tools and techniques as those presented in 
Section IV.D and in certain subsections of Section VI. It may 
turn out to be important to anyone to be aware of such 
complex epistemic patterns (concerning human agents A1, 
A2, A3,... and potential facts 1, 2, 3,...) as the situations 
sketched in the following paragraphs. 
A1 and A2 both know  with(out) knowing this about 
each other. 
A1, who knows , wants A2 to think that he does not 
know  or that he thinks so that  is probably false. 
A1 wants to get known from A2 whether  is true or 
false, but he does not want her to notice this intention. 
A1, who is telling A2 that  is true, is almost sure that A2 
is convinced that he does know whether  is true or false. 
A1 knows that A2 is aware of the fact that  is true but he 
pretends as if he did not know that. 
A1 did not know whether 1 or 2 is true out of two 
incompatible statements but he had to make a decision. He 
knew that 1 is true according to A1, A2, and A3, while 2 is 
true according to A'1, A'2, and A'3. Now he thinks so that 1 
is probably true while 2 is probably false. He has made this 
decision on the basis of the following facts and 
assumptions: A1, A2, and A3 have proved reliable people in 
similar cases in which decisions had to be made, in contrast 
to A'1, A'2, and A'3. Moreover, A1 suspects that A'1, A'2, and 
A'3, who have close contact with each other, are interested in 
his believing in 2, whereas A1, A2, and A3 are likely to 
have never met each other. 
III. 
THE DECISIVE ELEMENTS OF THE DEFINITION  OF  
EALIS 
The relevant parts of the mathematical definition of 
eALIS (whose 40 page long complete version is available 
in [2]) are summarized here. As interpreters’ mind 
representation is part of the world model, the definition of 
this model  = U, W0, W is a complex structure where 
 
U is a countably infinite set: the universe; 
 
W0 = U0, T, S, I, D, , A: the external world; 
 
W is a partial function from IT where W[i,t] is a 
quintuple U[i], [i,t], [i,t], [i,t], [i,t]:  
the internal-world function. 
The 
external 
world 
consists 
of 
the 
following 
components: 
 
U0 is the external universe (U0  U), whose elements 
are called entities; 
 
T = T,  is a structured set of temporal intervals; 
 
S = S,  is a structured set of spatial entities; 
 
I = I,  is a structured set of interpreters; 
 
D = D,  is a structured set of linguistic signs 
(practically morph-like entities and bigger chunks of 
discourses performed), 
 
where TU0,  SU0, IU0, DU0, 
 
    TU0* is the set of core relations (with time 
intervals as the first argument of all core relations), 
 
A is the information structure of the external world 
(which is nothing else but relation structure  
reformulated as a standard simple information 
structure, as is defined in [61]; its basic elements are 
called the infons of the external world. 
The above mentioned internal-world function W is 
defined as follows: 
 
The relation structure W[i,t] is called the internal 
world (or information state) of interpreter i at 
moment t; 

89

 
U[i]  U is an infinite set: interpreter i’s internal 
universe (or the set of i’s referents, or internal 
entities); U[i’] and U[i”] are disjoint sets if i’ and i” 
are two different interpreters; 
 
what changes during an interpreter i’s lifespan is not 
her referent set U[i] but only the four relations 
among the (peg-like [62] [8]) referents, given 
below, which are called i’s internal functions: 
 
[i,t] : U[i]  U[i] is a partial function: the 
eventuality function (where  is a complex label 
characterizing argument types of predicates), 
 
[i,t] : U[i]  U[i]U0  is another partial 
function: the anchoring function ( practically 
identifies referents, and  contains complex labels 
referring to the legitimizing grammatical factors); 
 
[i,t] : U[i]  U[i]  is a third partial function: 
the level function (where elements of  are called 
level labels); the level function is intended to capture 
the “box hierarchy” among referents in complex 
Kampian DRS boxes [21] enriched with some 
rhetorical hierarchy in the style of SDRT [22], 
 
[i,t] :   U[i]  is also a partial function: the 
cursor, which points to certain temporary reference 
points prominently relevant to the interpreter such as 
“Now”, “Here”, “Ego”, “Then”, “There”, “You” 
[38]; 
 
The temporary states of these four internal functions 
above an interpreter’s internal universe serve as her 
“agent model”, or mind representation, in the 
process of (static and dynamic) interpretation. 
Suppose the information structure A of the external 
world (defined above as a part of model  = U, W0, W) 
contains the following infon:  = perceive, t, i, j, d, s, 
where i and j are interpreters, t is a point of time, s is a 
spatial entity, d is a discourse (chunk), and ‘perceive’ is a 
distinguished core relation (i.e., an element of ). The 
interpretation of this “perceived” discourse d can be defined 
in our model relative to an external world W0 and internal 
world W[i,t]. 
The dynamic interpretation of discourse d is essentially a 
mapping from W[i,t], which is a temporary information 
state of interpreter i, to another (potential) information state 
of the same interpreter that is an extension of W[i,t]; which 
practically means that the above mentioned four internal 
functions (, , , ) are to be developed monotonically by 
simultaneous recursion, expressing the addition of the 
information stored by discourse d to that stored in W[i,t]. 
The new value of eventuality function  chiefly depends 
on the lexical items retrieved from the interpreter’s internal 
mental lexicon as a result of the perception and recognition 
of the words / morphemes of the interpreter’s mother tongue 
in discourse d. This process of the identification of lexical 
items can be regarded as the first phase of the dynamic 
interpretation of (a sentence of) d. In our eALIS 
framework, extending function  corresponds to the process 
of accumulating DRS condition rows containing referents 
that are all―still―regarded as different from each other. 
It will be the next phase of dynamic interpretation to 
anchor these referents to each other (by function ) on the 
basis of different grammatical relations that can be 
established due to the recognized order of morphs / words 
in discourse d and the case, agreement and other markers it 
contains. In our approach, two referents will never have 
been identified (or deleted), they will only be anchored to 
each other; but this anchoring essentially corresponds to the 
identification of referents in DRSs. 
The third phase in this simplified description of the 
process of dynamic interpretation concerns the third internal 
function, , the level function. This function is responsible 
for the expression of intra- and inter-sentential scope 
hierarchy [63] [64] / information structure [32] [33] [34] / 
rhetorical structure [22], including the embedding of 
sentences, one after the other, in the currently given 
information state by means of rhetorical relations essentially 
in the way suggested in SDRT. 
It is to be mentioned that the information-state changing 
dynamic interpretation and the truth-value calculating static 
interpretation are mutually based upon each other. On the 
one hand, static interpretation operates on the representation 
of sentences (of discourses) that is nothing else but the 
output result of dynamic interpretation. On the other hand, 
however, the above discussed phases of dynamic 
interpretation (and chiefly the third phase) include 
subprocesses 
requiring 
static 
interpretation: 
certain 
presuppositions are to be verified [21] [38]. 
The interpreter’s fourth internal function, cursor , plays 
certain roles during the whole process of dynamic 
interpretation. Aspect, for instance, can be captured in our 
approach as the resetting or retaining of the temporal cursor 
value as a result of the interpretation of a sentence ( non-
progressive / progressive aspect, respectively). It can be said 
in general that the input cursor values have a considerable 
effect on the embedding of the “new information” carried by 
a sentence in the interpreter’s current information state and 
then this embedding will affect the output cursor values 
[65]. 
Dynamic interpretation in a eALIS model =U, W0, 
W, thus, is a partial function Dyn that maps a (potential) 
information state W° to a discourse d and an information 
state W[i,t] (of an interpreter i):  
 
Dyn(d) : ,W[i,t]  W°, e°, U°, 
 
where U°, shown up in the output triple, is the cost 
of the given dynamic interpretation (coming from 
presuppositions legitimized by accommodation 
instead of verification), and e° is the eventuality that 
the output cursor points to (this is the eventuality to 
be regarded as representing the content of discourse 
d). Function Dyn(d) is partial: where there is no 
output value, the discourse is claimed to be ill-
formed in the given context. Due to the application 
of cost, ill-formedness is practically a gradual 
category in eALIS. 
The static interpretation of a discourse d is nothing else 
but the static interpretation of the eventuality referent that 
represents it. The recursive definition of static interpretation

is finally based upon anchoring internal entities of 
interpreters to external entities in the external universe, and 
advances from smaller units of (the sentences of) the 
discourse towards more complex units. 
The “prism effect”, mentioned in Section II, is worth to 
be given a separate definition in the system of eALIS, as 
follows, because our linguistic illustrations are practically 
based on this single formula. 
A clause performed in a context conveys an infon that 
belongs to an intensional profile, which is an element of the 
set defined below: the power set of the set of finite 
sequences of a particularly specialized set of the above-
defined level labels. The clause is to be interpreted against 
the (possible-world-like but finite) components of this 
intensional profile in order to obtain its truth conditions and 
other semantic and/or pragmatic well-formedness conditions 
in the given context.

The 
theoretically 
highly 
important 
mathematical 
exactness, which this formula is intended to suggest, 
provides a simple, straightforward, uniform, well motivated, 
and “user-friendly” approach to reach the ultimate aim of 
pragmalinguistics  [66] [67]: to account for the use of the 
semantic content of the sentences performed in a certain 
context (see also [45]). 
Let us start the elaboration of the details with set M in 
formula (1): it is the set of modal labels that say whether an 
infon serves to someone as some kind of belief (BEL), or 
desire (DES), or intension (INT), or anything else ([5]; see 
also [38]). Mann [68] establishes that “[p]erhaps the most 
important distinction for modeling the intentions that 
accompany language use is a contrast between intended 
actions and intended effects. Intended effects typically are 
states of affairs that the intender desires or prefers, while 
intended actions typically involve some identifiable process 
within the capacities of the actor(s).” On the basis of this, 
‘intended effects’ are called desires (DES) in eALIS. 
Set I provides degrees for expressing the intensity of 
the given modality, from “maximum” (MAX or M) through 
“great” (gr) up to “some” (sm). Associated with the 
modality BEL, for instance, this scale ranges from sure 
knowledge to weak conjecture. There must be “uncertain” 
degrees between “known” and “unknown” [69]. The 
muss/soll/will triplet of German epistemic modal auxiliary 
verbs can be regarded as evidence for the existence of at 
least three non-maximal degrees [38]. It requires much 
future research to decide how many degrees have a 
linguistic relevance in the certainty-uncertainty continuum 
[42]. The power set P(I) of I is used in formula (1), because 
certain modal words may be associated with more than one 
degree of intensity of a given modality. 
Set R is responsible for referring to the host of the 
given infon, who can primarily be the speaker (MY) or the 
hearer (YR: ‘your’). That is, the possible-world-like (but 
finite) basis of interpretation (1), called a “worldlet” in 
eALIS [13], can be the conglomerate of “my faint 
conjectures” or “your strong desires”, and so on. 
Set T adds “temporal stamps” to worldlets, expressing 
in which period it holds that a given infon belongs to a 
given worldlet in someone’s mind (to the one, for instance, 
that stores someone’s faint conjectures). 
Worldlets are also assigned polarity values, which are 
members of the eight-element powerset P({+,–,0}) of the 
two traditional polarity values “true” (+) and “false” (–) and 
a not so accustomed value “non-specified” (see the category 
“unknown” in [69]). The crucial importance of the fact that 
the traditional two-element set of truth values has been 
extended to an eight-element one is illustrated by the 
difference between the interpretation of (4a) and (4b). In the 
latter case what is certain is that the given infon (“Ben is a 
linguist”) is not assigned 0 in Sue’s mind; but sentence (4b) 
does not reveal whether it is true or it is false that Ben is a 
linguist.

Figure 4.  Sentences to be interpreted in different world(let)s. 
The Kleene-star in formula (1) manifests the 
“reciprocal” character of eALIS by offering, instead of 
quintuples of the above-discussed labels, finite series of 
such quintuples. The series shown in (4c), for instance, 
points to a special segment of Joe’s mind: namely, to the 
worldlet containing Joe’s hypotheses on Sue’s intentions 
towards exactly on his would-be information state. 
Finally, the power set symbol in the initial position of 
formula (1) requires some explanation. The point is that an 
infon (a piece of information) can be simultaneously associated 
with more series of worldlet labels (in the human mind). The 
reference to a “prism effect” in (1) expresses this viewpoint. 
The content of the components in Fig. 5, for instance, 
applied to the Hungarian declarative sentence in (5a), is as 
follows, from left to right: “(5b) I, (the addresser: AR) know 
that Péter moved to Mari (I refrain from telling lies or 
bluffing). (5c) I think that you (the addressee: ae) do not 
know this. (5d) I think that you would like to be aware of 
this fact at a later point + in time (otherwise, I would not 
have uttered the sentence, since it is important for me to be 
relevant). (5e) (Being also cooperative) I intend to help you 
to acquire the infon in question.” This analysis is based on 
the Gricean maxims of conversation [70]; further details are 
available in our following papers: [5] [3]. The visual 
representation is essentially a conglomerate of (S)DRT 
boxes, but, instead of parts of segmented logical formulas, it 
is immediately the referents (constants/variables) contained 
that are placed in the partially ordered boxes (in the form of 
Landmanian 
“pegs” 
[62] [8]), 
augmented 
with 
the 
aforementioned level labels.

Figure 5.  The intensional profile of the Hungarian declarative sentence. 
The conglomerate of the four components in (6b-e) and 
in Fig. 6 is the intensional profile of the simplest type of 
yes/no questions in Hungarian, as is proposed in [6] and [3]. 
Its specific content can be formulated in English as follows, 
compared to that of the declarative sentence. “1. Now it is 
me, the addresser, who does not know if Péter moved to 
Mari. 2. I think, however, that you know the truth. 3. I wish I 
also knew the truth. 4. (That is why I have started the 
conversation) I intend to help you to intend to help me to 
acquire the infon in question.” 
The circled fifth component presents the pragmatico-
semantic contribution of the discourse particle ugye (see also 
the level label given in (6f)). Its contribution can be defined 
by simply adding a single component to the four-component 
representation of the yes/no question, which is responsible 
for expressing the speaker’s bias towards the positive 
answer: “I consider it likely that Péter called Mari.” Note in 
passing that it is no contradiction that the speaker conveys 
that (s)he is not absolutely sure that Péter moved to Mari 
(6b) but, at the same time, (s)he considers it quite likely (6f). 
In our approach, as was mentioned, different levels of 
knowledge (BEL/MAX vs. BEL/gr) can be considered, and 
can also be evaluated separately. 
Our analysis of the discourse particle vajon [3] is based 
on the observations of Gärtner and Gyuris [71] and Schirm 
[72] 
that 
this 
special 
grammatical 
clue 
expresses 
“speculation”, “hesitation”, “uncertainty”, “curiosity”, and 
“reflection”. Its meaning—or rather, its pragmatico-semantic 
contribution—can be revealed by comparing its intensional 
profile to the intensional profile given in (6b-e), which shows 
differences in two components out of the four. 
The content of the components in Fig. 6.II can be 
paraphrased as follows: “1. I do not know if Péter moved to 
Mari’s. 2. I consider it likely (unfortunately) that you do not 
know the truth either. 3. I wish I knew the truth. 4. (Why 
have I started the conversation, anyway?) I want you to 
know that I intend to acquire the given infon.”

ugye (see I. and (6a'-f)) and vajon (see 6.II and (6g-g")). 
Components 1 and 3 are common: the addresser, who 
does not know if a certain infon is true or false, longs for this 
knowledge. Components 2 and 4 are new. The addresser 
does not really hope that the addressee knows the answer; 
(s)he is only thinking aloud, with no immediate purpose. The 
only realistic purpose for him/her may be to make the 
addressee know that (s)he needs the answer. 
It is worth addressing the division of labor between 
pragmatics and semantics. We can separate the at-issue 
meaning (coming from the original question) and the 
additional meaning (coming from the discourse particles). 
Ugye and vajon, discussed (briefly) above, bear the 
properties of conventional implicatures [73] [74], namely: 
semantic (lexical), independent (from at-issue content), 
secondary 
(supporting 
content—“fine-tuning”), 
not

backgrounded (not part of the common ground), not 
deniable, and invariably speaker-oriented. In both cases, the 
at-issue meaning denotes whether Péter moved to Mari’s or 
not. As for ugye, the conventional implicature expresses bias 
toward the positive answer (“I consider it likely that Péter 
moved to Mari’s,”; and as for vajon, the implicature 
translates (roughly) as “I wonder...” 
As is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, thus, picking out the 
sentence type can be regarded as a “basic settlement” of the 
intensional profile, relative to which discourse particles are 
responsible for “fine-tuning” it―as well as such further 
grammatical elements as epistemic modals [15] [45] [47], 
evidentials [24] [38], miratives [40], special stress patterns, and 
Austin’s [23] expositive verbs as they are construed in Oishi’s 
approach [24]. The following section is devoted to the 
illustration of these grammatical clues and their pragmatico-
semantic contribution to intensional profiles in the eALIS 
framework.  
 
IV. 
THE EALIS PRAGMATICS 
First of all, let us overview the requirements towards an 
up-to-date comprehensive pragmatics on the basis of a 
current paper by Labinaz and Sbisá [38], who argue that we 
need to go back to Austin’s [23] [36] and Searl’s [75] [76] 
speech act theory in order to provide a framework in which 
all the elements highlighted by the current accounts can be 
collected and coordinated. 
A. Towards a More Comprehensive Speech-Act Theoretical 
View 
According to Austin [23], every speech act comprises 
three distinct acts: the act of saying something (the 
locutionary act), what one does in saying it (the il-
locutionary act) and what one does by saying it (the 
perlocutionary act). Acts such as assertions, claims, guesses 
are illocutionary acts and have distinct, albeit related, 
illocutionary forces. It is worth picking up the idea that 
illocutionary acts can be described as the performance of a 
socially accepted procedure, and that this procedure is to 
lead to a “conventional” effect. Here are some of the 
elements that a procedure of such a kind should comprise: 
(i) kind of person that can execute the procedure; 
(ii) circumstances in which it is appropriate to execute the 
procedure; (iii) linguistic forms to be used in order to 
execute the procedure or make it recognizable; (iv) effects 
of the procedure on the deontic statuses of the participants; 
(v) appropriate psychological states of the participants; 
(vi) appropriate subsequent behavior of the participants, to 
which they are committed by the procedure executed. 
B. Another Speech-Act Theoretical View with the Same Aims 
Oishi [24] also intends to revisit and develop Austin’s 
speech act theory, to put forward the idea that expositive 
verbs bring about effects on the on-going discourse, and that 
evidentials and epistemic modals play discursive functions 
by indicating those acts. She argues that to indicate (i) the 
information source of a thing, event, or situation by an 
evidential, and (ii) the speaker’s epistemic attitude toward it 
by an epistemic modal is to indicate what illocutionary act 
the utterance performs. Especially, evidentials and epistemic 
modals indicate a particular type of expositive illocutionary 
act, which is one of Austin’s categories of illocutionary acts. 
We intend to complete this list of indicators with miratives 
(e.g., gee in English and its Hungarian counterpart jé) and 
with special stress patterns, beyond the choice of the 
sentence type itself; see Subsection IV-C. 
Oishi [24] argues that in performing one of the various 
types of expositive act, the speaker expounds her/his 
communicative engagement with the hearer, while inviting 
him to react to it in a specific way. There are various types 
of communicative activities that the speaker can provide: in 
saying an utterance, the speaker does something with a 
thing/event/situation in the world, with a statement, with the 
hearer, with knowledge about a thing/event/situation in the 
world, with the statement that has been imported, and/or 
with a thought. 
All this can be captured in the theory proposed by Oishi 
[24] in a surprisingly simple way: in the case of each speech 
act, the speaker is to be distinguished from the addresser of 
the act, and the hearer from the addressee of the act, and the 
situation from the context of the act. The dynamism of 
performing the illocutionary act and the corresponding 
perlocutionary 
act, 
thus, 
is 
explained 
as 
complex 
interrelations between the speaker and the addresser, the 
hearer and the addressee, and the situation and the context. 
C. Checking The Complex Pragmatic Interrelations via 
Generalized Truth-Conditional Evaluation in eALIS 
We claim that checking all elements of the afore-
mentioned complex interrelations, as well as the similar ones 
listed in Subsection IV-A as (i-vi), essentially boil down to 
the evaluation of truth values over the eALIS universe, 
defined in Section III, due to the simultaneous presence in a 
single model of the external world and all of its mind-
internal (finite) alternatives; see Fig. 1 in Section II. 
As for checking, for instance, whether the particular 
speaker and the particular hearer are suitable for playing the 
roles of the addresser and the addressee in the case of 
certain speech acts, a finite set of external relations must be 
checked even in the world’s most complicated system of 
speech levels and honorifics in Korean; see Table I. 
The plain level, for instance, is used typically by any 
speaker to any child, to his own younger sibling, child, or 
grandchild regardless of age, or to one’s daughter-in-law, or 
between intimate adult friends whose friendship started in 
childhood. The intimate level is used by a child of pre-
school age to his or her family members including parents, 
or between close friends whose friendship began in 
childhood or adolescence. It may also be used to one’s adult 
or adolescent student, or to one’s son-in-law. The familiar 
level is slightly more formal than the intimate level, 
typically used by a male adult to an adolescent such as a 
high school or college student or to one’s son-in-law, or 
between two close adult friends whose friendship began in 
adolescence. The remaining three levels are used only to 
adult hearers.

Table I. Honorification in Korean [77] [78] 
Probably the most popular level is the polite level, which is 
the informal counterpart of the deferential level. While 
deferential level is usually used by males, the polite level is 
used widely by both males and females in daily conversations. 
Both the polite and the deferential levels are used to a socially 
equal or superior person, but in general, the polite level is 
favored between close persons. It is also worth mentioning that 
no propositive form is available in the superpolite level, 
presumably due to the fact that the addressee must be so vastly 
superior when using this level that the speaker could not 
propose to share an action; and so on. 
The details are irrelevant here. What is relevant is that 
however intricate this system is, capturing the interrelations 
is nothing more than a typical programming task for 
ambitious Prolog beginners. 
Checking whether a situation is a suitable context for a 
particular expository speech act, predominantly requires the 
pattern matching techniques developed in (S)DRT [22], 
underlying eALIS. Antecedents of pronouns and definite 
noun phrases are to be sought either in certain worldlets in 
certain minds (in the course of anaphora resolution) or in the 
external-world model (in the case of deixis). Setting up 
rhetorical relations between a new infon and a salient infon 
in the context also belongs to the task discussed in this 
paragraph; this is exactly the specialty of SDRT [71] [26]. 
We conclude this section by noting that what Oishi [24] 
must consider a crucial difference between expositive acts 
and the other four classes of illocutionary acts proposed by 
Austin [23] is no difference in eALIS, in an advantageous 
way. “They are not changes in the world ... or changes in the 
social world ... In the expositive act, the speaker and the 
hearer are assumed to be discourse participants who sustain 
and develop the discourse. By performing this type of act, 
the speaker tries to control the discourse [and not the world] 
and influence the hearer as a discourse participant.” In 
eALIS, the internal contents of human minds are defined 
as parts of the world―as they are, indeed. 
D. Linguistic Clues in Hungarian Sentences and 
Intensional Profiles 
It is high time to exemplify the linguistic elements that 
contribute to the decision of the speech act, that is, 
essentially, to that of the intensional profile, in some way or 
another, as was promised in the last paragraph of Section III. 
Note that the annotations follow the conventions used in the 
series Approaches to Hungarian (Amsterdam: Benjamins). 
The (a) sentence in Fig. 7 is ambiguous due to the modal 
suffix in italics (-hAt). The epistemic (a') interpretation 
differs from the deontic (a") interpretation in two crucial 
points [15]. While in the latter case the addresser commits 
her-/himself to the truth of the infon carrying the piece of 
information that Péter moved to Mari (‘B^M’ refers to 
‘maximal belief’, that is, to certain knowledge), in the 
former case (s)he has only “some certainty”. The other 
difference is that according to the deontic interpretation 
there is a person r* whose intention it depends on whether 
Péter can move to Mari. It is asserted in the case in question 
that r*’s intention towards the move is neutral (‘0’), and not 
positive or negative; r*, thus, permits the move in question, 
by withholding his intention. In the case of the epistemic 
interpretation, what the addresser does not intend 
(‘I,M,AR,,0’) is to prevent the addressee from con-
jecturing (‘B,sm,ae,+,+’) that Péter moved to Mari. 
Sentence (7b) is also a conjecture expressing the 
addresser’s epistemic uncertainty (7b'), but its meaning has an 
interesting evidential component (7b"): it is implied that the 
addresser probably saw the action in question.

peculiar meaning contribution is that the addresser accepts 
the given infon (7c'), which is new to her or him (7c"), and 
somewhat surprising (7c''').

Figure 7.  Markers of epistemic and deontic modality, and evidential and 
mirative markers in Hungarian 
The discourse particle persze (cca. ‘of course’) is used in 
contexts when speaker and listener share or are supposed to 
share common knowledge [80]. We claim that it 
corresponds to the Latin scilicet, which “indicates that the 
evidence is based on expectation  (‘as is to be expected,’ ‘of 
course’) and is strongly directed towards the addressee, [in 
contrast to, say] videlicet [which] indicates that the evidence 
is inferable from the context or reasoning (‘clearly’) and is 
not directed towards the addressee” [81]. This special 
meaning component is captured by the level label presented 
in (8d") via referring to an information state of the addressee 
that precedes the utterance time (–); it is expressed in this 
way that the addressee could have been almost sure that 
Péter had moved to Mari without having been informed 
about that. That is, this almost certain piece of knowledge is 
not due to any inference drawn on the basis of what has 
been said by the addresser, but rests upon the given 
addressee’s peculiar knowledge. 
Now we provide a comparative overview of different 
Hungarian sentence types with imperative verb morphology 
given in (8a-f), whose intensional profiles are presented in 
the table. Our pragmatico-semantic analyses are chiefly 
based on Szücs’s empirical observations and systematization 
[82] but other results are also considered [71] [83].

Figure 8.  The intensional profiles of some Hungarian sentence types with 
imperative verb morphology (see also Table II) 
It is common in all types (see the first two rows of Table II) 
that the addresser of the chosen speech act is sure that the result 
phase res(e) [65] of the given eventuality e does not hold (i.e., 
Péter and Mari still live in different flats, that is, Péter has not 
moved to Mari yet) and more or less assumes that the addressee 
is also aware of this fact (the certainty of her or his assumption 
is given as ‘nM’, that is, ‘non-maximal’). 
By performing the basic imperative type (8a), the 
addresser longs for the aforementioned result state res(e) 
and wants the addressee to intend the action e. The 
addressee’s stimulated intention is optimally efficient if 
(s)he coincides with the agent of the action (“Move to 
Mari’s.”). It is, however, definitely excluded that the 
addresser and the Agent coincide (8a') [84]. Note that (8a) is 
the only imperative in the strict sense proposed in [71], (8b-
f) can rather be classified as proto-imperatives.

Type (8b) differs from the basic type only in intoning the 
first syllable of the verb stem in a peculiarly lengthened way. 
The effect is that now it is not the addresser who longs for the 
given action but the addressee or the agent of the action. As for 
intentions, the addresser remains neutral, and does not want the 
addressee to do anything against e. It is, again, definitely 
excluded that the addresser and the Agent coincide (8b'). 
Type (8c) is associated with a third “distribution” of 
intentions among the three straightforwardly interested 
participants: the addresser, the addressee and the agent of the 
action in question. Now it is the addressee who is assumed 
not to long for res(e) while the addresser and the Agent long 
for it. The latter two participants preferably coincide (8c') 
while this time it is the coincidence of the addressee and the 
Agent that is excluded. 
In the speech act defined by (8e), the addresser is 
definitely against res(e), which is now assumed to be 
longed for very much by the agent (or, perhaps, the 
addressee). (8f) presents a new distribution of intentions 
again: the addresser thinks that someone, preferably the 
agent, longs for res(e) very much, and (hence) wants this 
person to realize her or his wishes. 
Instead of entering into further details, which obviously 
does not belong to the aims of this paper, we would like to 
call the reader’s attention to the following generalization: 
checking whether the speaker, the hearer and the given 
situation are suitable for serving as the addresser, the 
addressee and the context of the linguistically defined 
speech act (à la Oishi [24], see Section IV-B) simply 
requires a truth-conditional investigation primarily into the 
addresser’s mind’s certain worldlets (e.g., what (s)he longs 
for and assumes certain other persons to long for). The task 
boils down to get to the worldlets in which certain polarity 
values must then be checked. 
Let us now suppose that a speaker performs (9a), which 
is the same as (8b), while thinking what is described in (9b). 
As now all the beliefs, desires and intentions are compatible 
with the speech act determined by the imperative sentence 
type and the peculiar intonation, the speaker proves to be 
impeccably sincere while performing (9a). She or he is 
undoubtedly suitable for playing the addresser’s role in the 
speech act (s)he has initiated.

Figure 9.  Ideal matching between interlocutors and speech act 
participants, and mistake or deception in matching 
Let us now suppose, however, that the relevant facts are 
as in (9c). That is, the speaker does not know whether Péter 
lives together with Mari, and the hearer definitely knows 
that they already have lived together. In a case like this, the 
speaker was insincere due to her or his bluff, by which (s)he 
pretends as if (s)he were sure that Péter had not moved to 
Mari yet. As for the hearer, it would be pertinent to inform 
the speaker about the (supposed) mistake according to 
which Péter and Mari still live in different flats. It is in this 
way that the hearer should get rid of the incompatibility 
between the speaker’s declared presupposition and the real 
facts in the world. 
If the speaker thinks as follows while performing (9a): 
“you do not bother whether Péter moves to Mari or not, and 
Péter wants to definitely refrain from moving to Mari,” the 
utterance contains insincerity and/or hypocriticality. The 
speaker wants to deceit the hearer in respect of her or his 
knowledge on the hearer’s and Péter’s wishes.  
The intricate phenomena of politeness can also be 
captured on the basis of the triplets of the readily 
comparable intensional profiles of the utterance, of the 
addresser and of the addressee in eALIS (the theory) and 
by means of eALIS2.1 (the software application). As is 
illustrated in Fig. 10, the addressee her- or himself must 
consider two intensional profiles simultaneously in order to 
be capable of correctly decoding the addresser’s real 
intention. Utterance (10a) is itself ambiguous (10b-c), but it 
is also worth taking potential ulterior motives into account 
(10d). The addressee, thus, needs to continuously set up 
hypotheses during the on-going discourse in the form of 
intensional profiles, which are worth being compared to the 
linguistically encoded intensional profiles that belong to the 
clauses performed by the addresser. 
a. Főznél              egy        levest? 
       Cond.2Sg              a               soup.Acc 
 
b. literal meaning: ‘Do you want / [feel like] to cook a soup?’ 
c. request: ‘Cook a soup, please.’ 
 d. Suppose the sentence is used in a situation in which the addressee has been 
telling a story to a group of people, which is unpleasant to the addresser; the 
addresser intends to interrupt the addressee by this seeming request (or 
inquiry), in the hope that (s)he forgets to continue the unpleasant story. 
Figure 10.  Literal meaning, politeness or ulterior motives? 
In the particular case, thus, the hearer needs to decide on 
the basis of her of his own intensional profile about the 
speaker’s beliefs, desires and intentions whether (s)he is 
really interested in the addressee’s wishes (10b), or longs for 
a good soup (10c), or both hypotheses mentioned can be 
excluded and/or ulterior motives can me assumed. Observe 
that checking all these hypotheses can be modeled in eALIS 
as evaluating polarity values in appropriate worldlets in 
worldlet-based representations of human minds. 
Note in passing that certain polite forms do not yield 
ambiguity. The form presented in (11c), for instance, used 
typically by young people to old people, chiefly to old 
ladies, has no any kind of literal meaning. It is 
conventionalized in such a way that is to be regarded as an 
unambiguous expression of a certain speech act. 
 
a. Láttad?     b. Látta?         c. Tetszett            látni? 
                              see.Past.2Sg    see.Past.3Sg       like Past.3Sg      see.Inf 
 
‘Have youSg. seen it?’ 
Figure 11.  Degrees of politeness in Hungarian 
The type illustrated in (11b), however, is ambiguous between 
a “literal meaning” with a 3Sg. subject (‘Have (s)he seen it?’) 
and a polite interpretation in which the subject is the addressee.

V. 
USERS AND USES 
eALIS1.1 
(just 
like 
eALIS2.1) 
is 
worth 
demonstrating as a software application  intended to supply 
collaborating linguists and certain types of non-linguist 
experts, because in this way it is quite easy to capture, at the 
same time, the required input data types and the output 
production. 
A. Internal Users 
Our software application eALIS1.1 is primarily 
intended to supply linguists with a device to build fragments 
of arbitrary languages of arbitrary morphological types (NB: 
it is worth elaborating applications based on Hungarian 
since this language is an ideal challenge due to its extremely 
rich morphology [18] [20] [55]). These fragments can 
capture such specialties of human languages as, for instance, 
the compositional cumulation of meaning units [25]. The 
definable meanings are pragmatico-semantic descriptions 
that satisfy the relevant definitions of eALIS. The group 
of users defined in Section V-A will be referred to as 
internal users. 
B. External Users 
Those using the developed language fragment will be 
referred to as external users. In the course of using the 
software application, they can select lexical items to build 
sentences, the (generalized) truth-conditional interpretation 
of which they will be given on the basis of a “multiplied 
world model”, which they have themselves constructed or 
received from “internal” experts [12].  
Possible external users may be detectives or judges, for 
instance, who can have the truth of groups of propositions 
evaluated. In harmony with our “constructionist” stance, we 
mean by the aforementioned “generalized truth-conditional 
evaluation”, besides the final true/false value, the collection 
of all the information required to reach this truth value. Our 
software application thus, among others, serves the purpose 
of collecting and systematizing data in the effective 
structure that eALIS offers. eALIS2.1 offers an even 
more extended truth-conditional evaluation, which pertains 
to all the pragmatic aspects discussed in Section IV. It is 
checked, thus, whether the speaker, the hearer and the given 
situation are suitable for serving as the addresser, the 
addressee and the context of the linguistically defined 
speech act, on the basis of the model of the external world 
and its human-mind-internal images called worldlets in 
eALIS (Section IV-D). 
C. Defining Relations 
Internal users can define an external world w0, over the 
universe of which (consisting of entities ui) they can define 
relations of different arities [25]. One argument of all these 
relations is to be a series of disjoint temporal intervals. The 
program is to “dictate” (through permanent queries) the 
development of the external world: it requests new and new 
relations, and in the case of a given relation it requests the 
provision of (the initial and final points of) temporal 
intervals (among others). 
Such relations can be defined in this way that are 
homogeneous in the sense that they qualify as true or false 
“momentarily”, i.e., at each internal point of the temporal 
intervals independently. In Hungarian, for instance, utazik 
‘travel’ and úszik ‘swim’ are homogeneous relations while 
hazautazik ‘travel home’ and átússza ‘swim across’ are 
heterogeneous. Further, each argument position of a relation 
can be associated with other relations of the group of 
relations defined earlier that provide us with restricting 
information. The agent argument of the Hungarian verb 
utazik ‘travel’, for instance, can be associated with the 
restricting relation ember ‘human’. 
D. Defining Label Strings of Worldlets 
 Relative to the set of “worldlets” (small partial models 
of alternative worlds) defined up to a certain point, the 
internal user can define (by simultaneous recursion) a new 
worldlet where the basis of this definition is the singleton 
consisting of the external world w0. Specifically, relative to 
a worldlet w', a worldlet w" can be determined through a 
quintuple of labels like the one shown in (12a). Recall that it 
defines the worldlet containing a human being’s (rSue) 
knowledge (“maximal” belief); see sentence (2b) in Section II 
and (4a) in Section III. 
a. BEL,MAX,rSue,",+ 
b. –  
c. BEL,sm,rJoe,,+INT,MAX,rSue,',+BEL,MAX,rJoe,",+ 
Figure 12.  Labeling worldlets. 
Alternatives to label BEL are labels INT (intention) and 
DES (desire), among others. Alternatives to label MAX are 
lower levels of intensity: e.g., aM (almost maximal). The 
fourth member of the label quintuple is polarity; the values 
of this parameter are listed in (12b), on the basis of formula 
(1) in Section III.  
The software application can show through what kind of 
defining steps one can reach a worldlet relative to the 
external world as a fixed starting point. The label string in 
(12c), for instance, defines a worldlet that is to be regarded 
as the collection of information the status of which can be 
captured, for instance, by means of the linguistic expression 
shown in (2c) in Section II: “Joe guesses that Sue definitely 
wants to convince him to take it for granted that [...].” The 
worldlet where we should get, thus, is inside Joe’s mind, 
immediately embedded in a worldlet containing thoughts that 
Joe attributes to Sue. The label of the worldlet in question 
expresses that it consists of Sue’s assumed intentions 
towards exactly Joe himself. 
E. Worldlets, Infons and Polarity Values 
Internal users can assign pieces of information to 
worldlets. This procedure is to be “dictated” by the program 
as follows. 
In the more general case, a point in time must be 
specified. As a reaction of the program, on the basis of the 
above-discussed temporal-interval series belonging to the 
relations, it is written which relations stand between which 
entities at the given point of time. If the user specifies, 

97
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 8 no 1 & 2, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
besides a point in time, a relation and some entities that 
occupy certain argument positions of the relation, the task of 
the program remains the writing of the lacking entities that 
stand in the given relation with the provided entities at the 
provided point in time. The unit of this writing process is 
the external infon [61]: an infon means the piece of 
information that certain entities stand in a certain relation at 
the given moment (e.g., Joe loves Sue, or Joe is just 
traveling). 
Internal users can assign an infon (produced in the way 
sketched above) to an arbitrary worldlet for an arbitrary 
temporal interval. The application of this temporal interval 
serves the purpose of capturing such factors as the 
dwindling into oblivion or some re-categorization of pieces 
of information. 
Assigning a group E of infons to a worldlet standing 
with the external world in the relation provided in (13a) can 
be interpreted as follows: Sue perceives information E from 
the external world and accepts as the current state of her 
environment. A similar interpretation in the case of the 
complex relation provided in (12c) is as follows: Joe 
suspects that Sue wants to make him to be sure that 
information E is true (while Sue herself, for instance, does 
not necessarily believe in the truth of E; nor is E true in the 
external world). 
If the same infon is simultaneously assigned to 
someone’s positive belief-worldlet (see ‘+’ in (12b)), 
negative desire-worldlet (‘–’) and neutral (‘0’) intention-
worldlet, this complex “evaluation” captures this typical 
situation: the person in question perceives something and 
accepts its truth, but longs for its opposite without intending 
to change it (at least at that moment). 
It is worth noting in connection with the polarity values 
listed in (12b) that if an entity does not stand in the relation 
‘be a linguist’ in the external world, then the infon declaring 
the given entity’s momentary being a linguist is to be 
assigned to the experiencer’s negative (‘–’) or ‘undefined’ 
(‘’) belief-worldlets depending on the restricting relations, 
mentioned in Section VI-A. Ben, for instance, can be 
thought by an experiencer to be “not a linguist” while in the 
case of the Eiffel Tower, its being a linguist is undefined. 
As for the combination +– in (12b), see (4b) in Section 
III, together with the relevant comments there. Further uses 
of the polarity-value combinations are exemplified in (5d), 
(6c-e), (7c'"), (8b-f) in the previous sections. 
F. Information Not Coming from Outside 
Internal users can also assign information to worldlets 
indirectly, that is, not on the basis of (the relations of) the 
external world. This is “dictated” by the program as follows. 
The program asks for predicate names and argument 
numbers, and then produce argument places with inserted 
“new” entities, which the software must also urge the user to 
anchor to “old” (external or internal) entities (NB: their 
anchoring to any entities is only a possibility). Section V-E, 
where we defined the procedure of creating infons assigned to 
worldlets in human minds on the basis of states of affairs in the 
external world, is worth completing with a short comment. An 
internal infon does not contain the same entity names as the 
corresponding external infon does. Instead of identifying them, 
the correspondence between external and internal entities is 
accounted for by (-) anchoring elements of the former group 
to those of the latter group. In this way, we can explain the 
cases of misunderstanding where the same external fact is 
linked to different participants in two experiencers’ minds (see 
the definition of eALIS in Section III). 
G. Building the Lexicon 
The internal user is given a core lexicon on the basis of 
the predicates the creation of which was described in 
Section VI-C; and this core lexicon is enriched with the 
predicates created in the way described in Section VI-D. 
Elements of the latter group of predicates must be associated 
with meaning postulates [25], by the help of queries of the 
program. 
Note that items of the core lexicon need not be 
associated with meaning postulates since their interpretation 
is trivial on the basis of their creation: as they have been 
created by copying certain “patterns” of the external world, 
the rule concerning the pattern matching their semantic 
evaluation is based on is automatic. True perception and 
pattern matching is the same process, considered from 
opposite directions (cf. Searl’s world-to-word and word-to-
world directions of fit [75]). 
Let us return to the predicates whose forms are defined 
in Section VI-D; they are assigned meaning in the way to be 
defined in Section VI-F. Before entering into details, it must 
be noted that this is the crucial innovation of eALIS1.1, 
because this is the toolbox which exploits the advantages 
and results of all the model-theoretic theories, the discourse-
representational innovations and the proof-theoretic ideas, 
and the “diagnosis” of cognitive linguistics on the 
weaknesses and shortcomings of these three approaches. 
What comes from formal semantics [25]? The procedure 
of pattern matching. Further, the application of inter-
pretational bases used as alternatives to each other 
(“possible worlds”  eALIS-worldlets). And the con-
sideration of the rate of successful instances of pattern 
matching compared to the entire set of possible instances of 
pattern matching. 
The idea of operation over the partially ordered system 
of worldlets is due to DRT [21] [22]. The step-by-step 
execution of this operation, referred to as ‘accommodation’ 
in DRT, coincides with the proof-theoretic processing of 
semantic information [43]. 
The modeling of the following linguistic elements is 
basically due to cognitive linguists [48] [85]: me, you, (s)he, 
here, there, now, then, these here (in the context), those 
there (demonstration); see also [38]. 
H. How to Define Lexical Items 
The program must help the internal user (the formal 
linguist) in assigning (groups of alternative) phonetic forms 
and meaning postulates to predicate names, besides such 
straightforward information as (sub)categorization and 
argument number.  
Meaning postulates essentially consist of first-order 
formulas. The most peculiar element of our method is that 

98
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 8 no 1 & 2, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
each formula like this must be associated with a set of such 
chains of worldlet labels as the one shown in (12b) and the 
information as to which worldlet(s) these chains to be linked 
to in the course of interpreting sentences (possibilities are 
the external worldlet, certain worldlets of the selected 
speaker/addresser, hearer/addressee, or participants referred 
to in the sentences, or worldlets that can be identified in the 
selected context or scope of demonstration (see the last 
paragraph in Section V-G). 
I. Use Cases for External Users Building the Lexicon 
The external users―who can construct a sentence and 
specify the speaker, the hearer, the entities assumed to be 
present in the context (and possibly a subset of those in the 
scope of some demonstration), the speech time and the time 
of reference, among others―are given a generalized truth 
evaluation. This means that they are given not only a truth 
value but also all the pragmatic well-formedness conditions 
of the sentence “performed” in the specified situation to be 
construed as the context of a certain speech act. 
Thus, they can look “inside” all relevant participants’ 
minds (i.e., the current and possibly some previous 
information states). They can realize, for instance, whether 
the definite noun phrases are suitable for unambiguously 
identifying the intended denotata. They can also receive 
information about the success of satisfying other kinds of 
presupposition. They can detect, through comparing the 
information provided by the sentence and the information 
found in the specified interlocutors’ appropriate worldlets, 
whether there might emerge some misunderstanding, lie, 
bluff, deception [5], as is expounded in Section IV-D. 
VI. 
LINGUISTIC EXAMPLES 
External users are given a peculiarly multiplied data base 
that contains, besides a relational model of some fragment of 
(the history of) the external world, several of its alternatives. 
Recall that these alternatives essentially play the role of 
possible worlds, known from intensional model-theoretic 
semantics, but they are finite constructions appearing as such 
parts of information-state models of interlocutors that can be 
construed as their beliefs, desires, intentions, or any other 
kinds of fictions. 
A. Generalized Truth Evaluation 
The above-sketched arrangement of worldlets enables us 
to carry out truth evaluation not only on the basis of the 
external world, which is necessary and sufficient, for 
instance, in the case of sentences (13a-a'), but also on the 
basis of internal worldlets, which is obviously necessary in 
the case of sentences like (13b). The truth of the variants 
shown in (13b) does not depend on any facts in the external 
world. It depends on nothing else but Joe’s knowledge, or 
the knowledge that Sue attributes to Joe. In this latter case, it 
requires more steps to reach the worldlet that can serve as 
the basis of truth evaluation (external world model  Sue’s 
belief  Sue’s hypotheses on Joe’s beliefs); cases like this 
make it necessary to localize worldlets in the recursive way 
illustrated in (12c) in Section V-D. Verbs expressing modal 
attitude (e.g., think, guess, conjecture, wish) and many other 
expressions (e.g., according to someone) can be associated 
with meaning postulates by means of the tool described in 
Section V-G: the essence of their meanings lies with the 
“direction indicator” function. Such direction indicators help 
us finding the worldlets that can serve as the basis of the 
truth evaluation of the proposition that appears in the 
appropriate argument positions of the modal verbs or other 
linguistic expressions in question. 
a. It was snowing.     a'. It has snowed. 
b. (Sue thinks that) Joe knows that it was snowing. 
c. Patty was traveling home. 
d. That tall Finnish woman is pretty. 
Figure 13.  Generalized truth evaluation relying on worldlets. 
B. Past Continuous and Present Perfect 
Internal users can work out exacting and sophisticated 
syntaxes and semantics by the help of the toolbox offered by 
eALIS1.1. 
The truth value of (13a), for instance, can be calculated in 
the following way: the program must query the values of then 
and there, and then it localizes the area of the temporal external 
world model where pattern matching is to be attempted in order 
to decide whether it is snowing “then” and “there”. 
The truth evaluation of (13a'), however, requires the values 
of here and now, and what is to be checked in the external 
world is whether the landscape is snowy. The meaning 
postulate of the verb snow, thus, contains the determination of 
the result state (snowy), too, discussed in detail in [65], for 
instance. Note in passing that (13a') pragmatically suggests that 
it is not snowing at the relevant moment while the land is 
snowy as a result of an earlier snowing. 
C. Progressive Aspect 
The truth evaluation of sentence (13c) also requires a 
polished and exacting meaning postulation because not only 
facts of the external world is to be taken into account. A 
progressive sentence like this is also to be evaluated to be 
true in a case in which Patty never got home (this 
observation is called the Imperfective Paradox [86]) but she 
proves to have been travelling at the moment of then, she 
proves to intend to come home, and the speaker proves to 
attribute a quite high likelihood to this arrival (Section V-H) 
[21] [65]. Thus, the content of certain internal worldlets is to 
be checked, besides the partial satisfaction of a travelling 
event in the external-world model. 
D. The Intensional Character of Nicknames 
A demanded pragmatico-semantic analysis of nicknames also 
requires the toolbox sketched in Section V-H. Who is Patty in 
(13c), for instance? Internal users can capture the essence of the 
task of finding denotata by construing nicknames as special 
predicates whose “truth evaluation” involves not (only) the 
external control on the correspondence between official names 
and nicknames but (also) the worldlets concerned in the following 
questions: is Patty a possible nickname of the speaker for the 
given person, does the speaker think that the addressee may (also) 
call her Patty, do they know this about each other, and so on. 
Hence, internal worldlets are to be checked via pattern matching.

E. (Partially) Subjective Predicates 
Example (13d) illustrates further advantages in meaning 
postulation of the toolbox demonstrated in Section V-H. 
The adjective pretty, for instance, is worth regarding as a 
fully personal and subjective judgment, with no extension in 
the external world. Nevertheless, (13d) does not mean 
exactly the same as the sentence I consider her pretty. The 
truth of this latter sentence exclusively depends on the 
speaker while it would be elegant to base the evaluation of 
sentence (13d) on a somewhat less speaker-dependent 
calculation. As follows, for instance: (13d) is considered 
true if most persons in the external-world model consider 
the given lady to be pretty. According to an even more 
elegant solution, instead of the entire set of persons, only 
those respected by the speaker are considered. The 
extension of the verb respect is to be checked in the 
external-world model, in a way that is essentially the same 
as checking the appropriate interpersonal relationships in the 
case of the superpolite Korean interlocutors discussed in 
connection with Table I in Section IV-C 
F. Demonstration and Anchoring 
The demonstrative noun phrase in (13d) illustrates another 
instance of the necessity for “pragmatically conscious” truth 
evaluation. That asks for the value of the “those there” 
parameter from the external user. It is elegant to assume that 
this value is a set of entities, out of which the program selects 
a unique entity on the basis of the predicates tall, Finnish and 
woman. Their extensions count in the external world, at least 
primarily; it is an elegant facility, however, to inspect the 
speaker’s beliefs as well, or the speaker’s hypothesis about 
the addressee’s beliefs: sentence (13d) can be evaluated as 
true but ill-formed if, for instance, the speaker intends to refer 
to a tall Swedish woman about whom they think, incorrectly, 
that she is Finnish. 
VII. EALIS1.1, EALIS2.1 AND RUDI 
Three software applications are compared with each 
other in this section. 
A. eALIS1.1 
The implementation eALIS1.1 is a client-server 
Windows application that has been elaborated in a Delphi 
environment, 
which 
guarantees 
rapid 
and 
flexible 
development. Access to data is executed via standard SQL 
commands by means of a relational  data-base management 
system. For this purpose, we currently use Firebird 
Interbase. 
The Prolog basis, applied in the experimental phase of 
our research [58] [59] [11], has been replaced with Delphi 
environment, which is more capable of managing large data-
bases, developing user-friendly interfaces, and constructing 
more complex applications. This is the radical difference 
between eALIS1.1 and the aforementioned works (NB: 
the Prolog basis is retained in certain software applications 
of ours [54] [87]). 
The menu items correspond to the services sketched in 
Section V. Particular menu items are available to the 
different kinds of users (also defined in Section V) after 
checking their identity and authenticity. In the course of 
parsing sentences, morphological input is produced by the 
procedures demonstrated in [20] [51] [55] , agreement rela-
tions are checked by a method similar to the one shown in 
[88], dependency relations are calculated by means of our 
special rank parameters [56], and Prim’s algorithm is used 
for producing one or more spanning trees with a minimal 
cost. At some points, the program provides illustrations of the 
structures constructed by either the system or its users: for 
instance, parsing trees, systems of worldlets, and anchoring 
relations of entities are illustrated. Fig. 14 presents this last 
facility. 
 
 
Figure 14.  Interpreting the sentence shown in Fig. 3. 
The software application is permanently developed and 
expanded, exploiting new scientific results; it has 
repercussions on the theory, due to the fact that the theory 
can be tested by means of the program. We are working on 
developing tests to evaluate its efficiency. 
B. RUDI 
As our software application inherently belongs to a 
radically new and holistic “pragmalinguistics” theory 
(Section II), it is uneasy to compare to software applications 
based on some different theoretical foundation. An 
exception is the SDRT-based experimental software 
dialogue system, 
RUDI [26], primarily due to its 
distinguished 
attention 
to 
the 
relationship 
between 
pragmatic phenomena and the external-world model. 
RUDI (“Resolving Underspecification with Discourse 
Information”) computes automatically some aspects of the 
content of scheduling dialogues, particularly the intended 
denotation of the temporal expressions, the speech acts 
performed and the underlying goals. RUDI has a number of 
nice features: it is a principled approximation of a logically 
precise 
and 
linguistically 
motivated 
framework 
for 
representing semantics and implicatures; it has a particularly 
simple architecture; and it records how reasoning with a 

100
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 8 no 1 & 2, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
combination of goals, semantics and speech acts serves to 
resolve underspecification that is generated by the grammar. 
RUDI analyzes such definite descriptions as requiring a 
bridging relation to an antecedent in the context. Fig. 15 
provides an example: it should be calculated what the 
temporal expression ‘4pm’ refers to in (the model of) the 
external world. 
 
A: “Can we meet on Friday?” 
 
B: “How about 4pm?” 
Figure 15.  Resolving the referential underspecification in the dialogue, 
which requires revealing the speech act type. 
Neither the bridging relation nor the antecedent are 
determined by the compositional semantics of the 
utterance, however. Thus, 
RUDI takes the semantic 
representation of such expressions to contain an 
underspecified 
relation 
between 
an 
underspecified 
antecedent and the referent for the expression. A task that 
is co-dependent on resolving this underspecification is 
computing how the utterance contributes to a coherent 
dialogue. Following SDRT [22], it is assumed that a 
dialogue is coherent just in case every proposition (and 
question and request) is rhetorically connected to another 
proposition (or question or request) in the dialogue, and all 
anaphoric expressions can be resolved. The rhetorical 
relations are viewed as speech act types in the RUDI 
project―that is the point where eALIS2.1 can be 
regarded as an extension of RUDI, given that in the 
eALIS theory further relations among pieces of 
information stored in (different worldlets of) minds, 
addressers, addressees, contexts and the external world are 
(intended to be) taken into account in a completely 
uniform system (see Section IV-C). 
It is also worth noting that the creators of RUDI [26] 
represent the same holistic stance typical of eALIS 
implementations in regarding information as flowing either 
from resolving the semantic underspecification to computing 
the rhetorical relation, or vice versa. They, thus, consider 
rhetorical relations (that is, practically speech acts) to be an 
essential source of information for resolving semantic 
underspecification that is generated by  the grammar. 
eALIS essentially follows SDRT, which represents 
discourse content as a “segmented discourse representation 
structure”, which is a recursive structure of labelled DRSs 
[27], with rhetorical relations between the labels. In contrast 
to traditional dynamic semantics (see also [27], for 
instance), SDRT attempts to represent the pragmatically 
preferred interpretation of a discourse―just like eALIS. 
The rule schema used in RUDI contrasts with the plan-
recognition approach to computing speech acts [89], which 
uses only the goals of the antecedent utterance, rather than its 
compositional and lexical semantics directly, to constrain the 
recognition of the current speech act. The dialogue presented in 
Fig. 16 illustrates the point: it depends on the particular external 
denotata of the temporal expressions whether interlocutor B has 
rejected A’s proposal or has declared that (s)he is prepared for 
elaborating it as a common aim. 
 
A: “Can we meet next week??” 
 
B: “I’m busy from the 16th to the 25th” 
Figure 16.  Computing the speech act (Rejection or Elaboration) requires 
considering the temporal reference in the external world. 
There are a number of advantages, thus, to allow direct 
access to the content of inferences. The successful 
performance of the current speech act is often dependent on 
the logical structure of the antecedent utterances, and goals 
do not reflect this logical structure; rather compositional 
semantics does (following DRT). An utterance in the 
context is chosen to which the current utterance can be 
attached via a rhetorical relation, and this in turn determines 
which antecedents are available. 
C. eALIS2.1 as an Extension of eALIS1.1 
It is very important to us that our software applications, 
which are permanently being developed, have repercussions on 
the theory, due to the fact that the theory can be tested and 
sophisticated by means of the program. eALIS2.1, thus, has 
been being developed (as an extension of eALIS1.1) exactly 
due to the enormous pragmatic extension of the eALIS 
theory itself, demonstrated in Section IV. 
Nevertheless, this part of the difference between 
eALIS2.1 and eALIS1.1 is predominantly quantitative, and 
not qualitative. It had also already belonged to the decisive 
properties of eALIS1.1 that, based on the truth-evaluating 
pattern-matching 
mechanisms 
between 
linguistic 
representations and world models, the same kind of pattern 
matching is executed everywhere in the uniform system 
consisting of a model of the external world and a partially 
ordered  conglomerate of its (meticulously labeled) finite 
human-created images we have dubbed worldlets. eALIS2.1 
is more developed than eALIS1.1 in the sense that much 
more relations are evaluated in this intricate database, whose 
crucial specialty is that one and the same piece of information 
appears simultaneously in innumerable places in the system 
(just like images on different sides of a prism). 
Let us overview the main problems we should cope with. 
Certain difficulties have to do with the fact that we are 
working on a completely general toolbox that utilizes the afore-
mentioned multiplied world model, that is, one that is 
underspecified in several respects but can be rapidly specified 
when it is designated for particular purposes. This also holds 
for the pragmalinguistics input; some difficult grammatical 
phenomena that must be captured in a demanding way are 
collected in Section IV, VI and VII-E. Due to the uniform and 
holistic approach of eALIS, we cannot afford to use parsers 
or other devices developed in other projects. Elaborating 
sufficiently sophisticated testbeds, however, require very much 
cost, time, energy and creativity.  
Recursivity is another stubborn problem. Unlimited 
chains of linguistic expressions can be produced, whose 
elaborated 
pragmatico-semantic 
analysis 
leads 
to 
proliferation problems. 
It is also difficult to register the copies of multiplied 
entities in almost identical alternative models. We need to 
apply safe and effective but very rapid methods in copying 

101
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 8 no 1 & 2, year 2015, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2015, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
huge databases in a way that makes it possible for us to 
carry out the relevant differences between them. 
Nevertheless, the most difficult task is the safe and 
systematic treatment of temporal entities, which come from 
the model of the external world as well as from the 
alternative models, and also come from the event structure 
of lexical items [65] and from the discourse structure of 
sentences to be parsed. We have been led to the conclusion 
that the utter key to different kinds of systematization 
problems is utilizing points of time as “identifying stamps”. 
Our ultimate task in this area, thus, is no less than 
modeling the episodic memory of the human mind 
[38]―together with the semantic memory.  
D. eALIS2.1 as a Model of Long-Term Memory 
Leiss [50] distinguishes the aforementioned two parts of 
long-term memory on the basis of Tulving’s research [90] as 
follows: “the semantic memory stores knowledge, whereas 
the episodic memory stores experiences”. 
It is relevant that, in contrast to semantic knowledge, 
episodic knowledge has space-time-index quality, because 
experience characteristically takes place in space and time, 
and consequently the respective space-time coordinates are 
mapped. As a rule, it is assumed that concepts emerge, in 
that experiential data are generalized so that they no longer 
contain space-time coordinates. The construction of episodic 
memory typically correlates with the acquisition of finite 
sentences, which, in turn, correlates with the use of inflected 
verbs. The function of finite sentences is to establish a 
reference by anchoring concepts to a space-time context. 
Without this technical device, autobiographical memories 
would not be possible. Space-time coordinates are 
constituted by the ATMM-complex, mentioned in Section 
II: by the aspect-coded space coordinates, by the time-coded 
tense coordinates, by mood coordinates that signal irrealis 
(i.e., statement not anchored in reality) versus realis in the 
sense of Carnap, and by the coordinates of the source of 
evidence the speaker relies on (see Fig. 7 in Section IV-D). 
The download of episodic experience by virtue of the 
grammatical categories aspect, tense, mood, and modality 
enables us to orient ourselves in the real world. These 
categories generate a system of coordinates that anchors our 
activities in the world, and which, in turn, provides indices 
for our memories, thereby makes them memorizable. 
The very difference between semantic memory and 
episodic memory consists of the fact that experiences are 
based on the first person, whereas knowledge is based on 
the intersubjectification of first-person experiences. Inter-
subjectification implies the neutralization of space-time 
coordinates, 
thus 
generating 
knowledge. 
Subjective 
certainty, and the download of this type of certainty, is 
achieved by virtue of the grammatical ATMM-categories. 
Here the functions of language are essential for gaining 
reference to the world. Objective certainty will be achieved 
by the never-ending construction of an intersubjectively 
negotiated lexicon. 
We claim that, due to its lifelong character, the part of 
the worldlet structure of eALIS where the internal entities 
(i.e., referents) are anchored to external entities in the world 
model (i.e., to real objects and persons) can readily be 
regarded as an implementation of episodic memory. 
Semantic memory consists of worldlets that contain 
referents that are not “out-anchored”.  
E. Missing Links 
Due to the aforementioned eALIS-model of long-term 
memory, the mechanisms captured in Pustejovsky’s 
Generative Lexicon [91] can be implemented. That is, it is 
possible to derive “a potentially infinite number of senses 
for words from finite [lexical] resources,” and to explain 
“the interpretation of words in context.” This can be 
regarded as a qualitative innovation in eALIS2.1, 
compared to eALIS1.1. 
The word London in (18a), for instance, is used in the 
given context as an attributive of the noun train. The 
problem with it is that while a London flat is a flat that ‘can 
be found in London,’ the London train in question is 
claimed to be in Bristol at the time of reference. In another 
context, the London train may refer to a train that can be 
found in Manchaster, in a train museum, and the attribute 
London refers to the city in which it was produced, or in 
which the museum can be found from which the given train 
has been borrowed. How can then the contextually adequate 
meaning be calculated? 
 
a. “The London train arrived in Bristol.” 


Figure 17.  Adjectives with an unbounded number of meanings. 
As was defined in Section III, the  eventuality function is 
responsible for “formulating” the elementary statements the 
given sentence provides, from word to word. (17b) presents 
that it is claimed that something arrived somewhere, which is 
a train. What is expressed in (17c), however, is incorrect, 
assumed that the attributive means ‘can be found in London’ 
(as a reasonable primary meaning). 
It is at this point that it is worth having recourse to the 
episodic memory in order to use it as a huge database. 
Suppose it contains episodic information expressing the fact 
that once ‘a train went from a certain place to a certain 
place’ (17d). If this information is deprived of the external 
anchors, such a temporary predicate can be constructed for 
the semantic memory by unifying its parts that has three 
arguments: ‘r'1 is a train from r'2 to r'3’ (17e). A copy of 
this temporary predicate can then be attempted to be applied 
in the episodic memory again, to whose from-argument the-
entity-that-can-be-found-in-London (referent r31 in (17b)) 
can successfully be anchored, as is formulated in (17e'). 
Thus, the solution is that it is the station from which the 
given train departed that can be found in London. 
Note that it is not excluded that other “solutions” may 
also come out as results; but it is sure that all results will 
come out that a human being is capable of finding on the 
basis of her or his past experiences. The emerging

“competing” results then can be compared with each other 
on the basis of multiplicity of computing and fitting into the 
broader context. 
A Hungarian ontology has also been built in eALIS2.1 
because the above-sketched search for the context-
dependent adequate interpretation of the expression London 
train can be made more efficient by attempting to replace 
train with such sister categories as bus and airplane, for 
instance, and London with Glasgow or Manchester, since 
the expression Glasgow bus can also help finding the 
missing link “scheduled service”. We are investigating what 
kinds of substitution can increase efficacy, and what kinds 
or substitution prove to be definitely harmful. 
Fig. 18 presents a verb with an underspecified meaning. 
In (18a), it seems to take two noun phrases as arguments; 
and suppose that in the case of an earlier occurrence, the 
associated specified meaning was ‘finished reading (a 
book).’ However, this reading is incompatible with (18a).

Figure 18.  Verbs with an unbounded number of meanings. 
It is reasonable to assume that the episodic memory 
contains, on the one hand, an occurrence of finish with an 
argument position for expressing actions (18d), and, on the 
other hand, information about a sandwich that has been 
eaten (18d'). Hence, copies of these pieces of information 
can be created for the semantic memory, on the basis of 
which, then, the story can be put together in the episodic 
memory, again, according to which the “sandwich finished” 
has been eaten (18e-e'). 
Nevertheless, other solutions may also come out, which 
may prove to be better in certain contexts. Ed, for instance, 
might have managed to butter the given sandwich. It is also 
worth mentioning that the aforementioned involvement of 
an ontology may also have a positive influence in finding 
the “missing link(s)” in the case of verbs with potentially 
infinite meanings. The expression sandwich, for instance, is 
worth attempting to be replaced with soup or cake, whose 
eating can also be finished. 
The verb resemble in (19a) may also be problematic if, 
say, in the course of its earlier occurrence the associated 
specific meaning was ‘resemble in being remarkably tall.’ 
This meaning is excluded if, say, Ed is tiny. 
 
a. “Ed resembles Ted.”

Figure 19.  Meta-level expressions? 
Such pieces of information need to be found in the 
episodic memory as those presented in (19d-e); first of all, 
an occurrence of resemble with an explicit in-argument for 
properties. Then predicates must be found there which have 
held for both Ed and Ted. We hypothesize that what should 
be found is not a great set of “shared” predicates, but rather 
a single one that is salient in some way in the context. Note 
that searching for predicates is not a second-order procedure 
in eALIS because, due to reification [8], predicates are 
assigned to Landmanian pegs [62] in the worldlets in the 
same way as arguments are, so they take part in the  
relations as equal internal entities (cf. [92]). 
The temporal adjective presented in (20a) patterns with 
the last three special words in being used not immediately as 
a simple predicative element. Thus, it cannot be claimed 
what is given in (20c), namely, that “he is former,” while it 
can be claimed that “he is a spy,” or “he is old.” That is why 
the temporal adjective in question is called an irregular 
adjective by Kiefer [92]. 
 
a. “I met a former spy.”

Figure 20.  Irregular adjectives I.: temporal adjectives. 
The solution of the “equation system” is quite simple in 
eALIS, given that ordinary verbs, nouns and adjectives 
provide -formulas containing temporal referents as well. In 
(20b), t1 and t2 are the temporal referents. If (20a) did not 
contain former, both t1 and t2 would be identical to the 
reference time. The contribution of former, thus, is the 
ordering between t1 and t2 presented in (20c'). That is, the 
person in question is claimed to serve as a spy earlier than 
the time of the meeting.  
We conclude this section with another adjective called 
irregular by Kiefer [93] essentially for the same reason: it 
cannot be claimed that “someone is alleged.” The 
contribution of this adjective to the content presented in 
(21b), thus, is not (21c).

The solution of this puzzle has to do with the crucial 
weapon of eALIS: the contribution of alleged is that infon 
e2 (according to which someone is a spy) must be set in a 
worldlet different from the worldlet in which e1 is to be set 
(according to which the speaker met someone). While it is 
claimed by the speaker, thus, that (s)he met someone, the 
claim that he is a spy is attributed to another person by the 
speaker (21c').

VIII. SUMMARY 
We have intended to convince the reader that it is not a 
huge cost for the (theoretical, and then computational) 
treatment of such “internal questions of language” as 
sentence types (Sections III-IV), honorification, epistemic 
and deontic modality, evidential and mirative markers, 
expression of politeness, special intonations (Section IV), 
tense, aspect, subjectivity, deixis (Section VI), irregular 
adjectives, and the problem of deriving a potentially infinite 
number of senses for words from finite lexical resources  
(Section VII) to attempt to formally describe information 
states of human minds in communication―that is, the 
human mind itself (Section I). 
Our ambitious stance can be legitimized by the Un-
Cartesian philosophical hypothesis on language, defended 
by Leiss [38] as follows: “...language is a type of translation 
of the world into mental representations. Language is a 
technical device for diagrammaticizing the world. It is not a 
device that directly reflects the world, but rather a motivated 
reduction of the complexity of reality through transduction 
into more or less specified diagrams of the world. Language 
enables us to  
do with the assistance of the technique of grammar 
(referential opposition of concepts), which enables us to 
orient ourselves in the real world in space and time. Beyond 
that, language provides the option, again on the basis of the 
construction of concepts, to generalize experiential 
certainties, thereby making them usable in contexts hitherto 
unexperienced.” 
This paper demonstrates what kind of ontological 
innovation (Section II) and mathematical techniques 
(Section III) are required to metamorphose the DRT-
hierarchy of Montagovian logical subformulas into 
intensional profiles of (expositive) speech acts, on the one 
hand, and descriptions of its addressers’ and addressees’ 
current information states, on the other hand, which can then 
be readily compared with each other―in the form of some 
kind of “generalized truth-evaluation” (including the 
checking of all kinds of semantic and pragmatic felicity 
conditions), as is claimed in Section IV. 
Then 
our 
software 
application 
eALIS1.1 
is 
demonstrated through discussing its different kinds of 
potential users and its main use cases for the users we call 
internal users and for those we call external users (Section 
V). Section VII presents the additional services of 
eALIS2.1 as compared to eALIS1.1 and an SDRT-based 
experimental software application called RUDI. We point out 
that eALIS2.1 can be regarded as a model of the two parts 
of 
long-term 
memory―episodic 
and 
semantic 
memory―and this enables us to calculate new senses for 
words “in contexts hitherto unexperienced,” as was 
formulated above (see also the illustration in Fig. 22).
