Abstract— We propose a vehicle ad-hoc network for traffic 
information service. It allows collecting and analyzing traffic 
status of large areas without any infrastructure, e.g., probe 
cars, road side unit, and server. The proposed scheme uses 
multi-channel and broadcasting technique. Vehicle terminal 
simply needs the existing navigation systems in vehicles and 
wireless 
communication 
devices 
for 
vehicle-to-vehicle 
communication. Communication and networking algorithm is 
given and experimented on the testbed. It effectively collects 
accurate traffic information, and is able to provide real-time 
traffic information propagation by using only vehicle-to-
vehicle(V2V) communications without infrastructure.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, many researchers have been studying on the 
active vehicle-safety services based on inter-vehicle 
communication to improve drivers’ safety [1]. This safety 
service aims at collision warning, collision avoidance, 
providing traffic information, etc. For instance, G. Held [1] 
discussed the traffic information service that assists drivers 
with the information of driving paths detouring accident 
zones or traffic jams in real-time manner.  
The traffic information service roughly divides into 
Intelligent Road and Vehicle Ad-hoc Network (VANET) in 
terms of inter-vehicle communication [2-4]. In Intelligent  
Road, the traffic information is wirelessly collected from 
vehicles to access points which are deployed along the roads, 
sent to the information center, processed, and then 
broadcasted to drivers on the roads. An example of this 
scheme is Traffic and Travel Information via Transport 
Protocol Expert Group (TPEG) service. However, it has 
several disadvantages, e.g., it costs a lot to incorporate 
facilities for the service along the roads. In addition, even 
though a number of information providers including taxis 
and buses participate in TPEG, real-time service is not easy 
to offer due to the time delay of more than 5 minutes for 
updating the information. Moreover, the traffic information 
provided by the agencies is not free of charge. In VANET, 
on the other hand, the traffic information is delivered directly 
from vehicle to vehicle. It can be delivered to the vehicle 
following in the same lane or to the vehicles, so called 
messengers, running in the opposite lane. However, VANET 
typically relies on broadcasting which may cause the channel 
collision that degrades communication efficiency or generate 
too many messages overloading the systems.  
In this paper, we propose a traffic information service 
based on vehicle ad-hoc network. The proposed scheme 
collects, processes, and distributes traffic information 
without establishing a specific infrastructure, e.g., server or 
separated monitoring systems. We design communication 
and networking algorithm. It utilizes three wireless channels. 
It only allows the last vehicle in a traffic jam to communicate 
with the vehicles in the opposite lane. This multichannel 
communication scheme minimizes the probability of 
message collision and simultaneously enables accurate and 
reliable data delivery. 
In Section II, a concept of traffic information service for 
traffic congestion avoidance is proposed. In Section III, 
method of channel operation for efficient use of resources is 
presented and Finally, in Section IV, conclusion of this study 
and description of future work are provided.

TRAFFIC INFORMATION SERVICE CONCEPT 
 
Vehicle C exchanges the traffic 
information with vehicle A and B.
Vehicle C can select an alternate 
route(          )
Vehicle A gets the traffic 
information. (Location,

Figure 1. Traffic Information Service Concept 
 
Figure 1 shows how the vehicle C avoids the traffic jam 
and arrives to the destination. Vehicle A, B, and C generate 
the traffic information based on location data supported by 
Global Positioning System (GPS). The collecting devices 
transfer and retrieve various information including vehicle 
speeds, traffic environment, etc. through the wireless 
network. The destination is where the vehicle C goes toward 
and the traffic jam is where the heavy traffic occurs.

The service scenario is as follows: (1) Vehicle C is on the 
way to the destination; (2) Vehicle A has been moving in 
“the direction of vehicle A” as shown in Figure 1. Since 
vehicle A went through the jammed area, it has obtained the 
traffic information, e.g., speed change of vehicles over the 
passed locations including the jammed area; (3) Vehicle B 
has been moving in “the direction of vehicle B” as shown in 
Figure 1.  The traffic information that vehicle B has 
obtained is likely to be normal since it did not pass through 
the jammed area; (4) Vehicle A, B, and C regularly transmit 
the traffic information on their respective paths; (5) If 
information collecting devices are incorporated on the road, 
they can serve to retrieve, process, and regularly transmit 
the traffic information to users; (6) Based on the delivered 
information from vehicle A and B, vehicle C can be aware 
of the traffic jam on the path of vehicle A in advance; and 
thus, (7) Vehicle C can choose the right path avoiding the 
heavy traffic.  
In summary, when vehicle C does not have a priori 
knowledge on the traffic ahead, it has possibility to meet the 
jammed area before it arrives to the destination. On the 
opposite lane, vehicle A has come from the jammed area and 
vehicle B has come without suffering any traffic jam. Since 
vehicle C receives traffic information from vehicle A and B 
on two possible paths in advance, it can choose its preferred 
path to the destination avoiding traffic jam.

Figure 2. An Example of Wireless Communication Channels  
 
Figure 2 shows the wireless communication channels of 
vehicles running on roads near traffic jammed areas. The 
vehicle’s 
terminal 
operates 
with 
three 
wireless 
communication chanels. The first channel (S1-Ch) is for 
communicating with the vehicles driving in north or east 
directions. 
The 
second 
channel 
(S2-Ch) 
is 
for 
communicating with vehicles driving in south or west 
directions. The third channel, called D-Ch, is for 
communicating with the vehicles driving in the opposite 
direction. 
B. 
Message Format 
The header and trailer are determined by the adopted 
PHY/MAC protocol. Note that all messages are broadcasted 
without any join and association procedure between vehicles. 
We define four types of messages that are classified by the 
value in Msg_Type field as follows.  
○1  Info_Req indicates that the message is a request for the 
vehicle ahead to send the traffic information through S-Ch. 
○2  Info_Resp indicates that the message contains traffic 
information and is sent to the rear car through S-Ch. 
○3  Jamming _Data indicates that the message contains 
traffic information about jammed area and is sent to the cars 
on the other lane through D-Ch. 
○4 Chg_CH_Cmd indicates that the message is a request 
for the last car to change the communication channel from 
D-Ch to S-Ch. This message is issued by a newly joining car 
to collect traffic information when it overhears the messages 
about jammed areas that the last car is sending through D-Ch.  
These 
messages 
assist 
driving 
vehicles 
with 
spatiotemporal traffic information contained in various 
message fields. For example, Start_Coordinate, Time_Stamp, 
Cause fields contain starting points, starting time, cause of 
traffic jam, respectively.  The length and route of traffic jam 
can be derived from Start_Coordinate with End_Coordinate 
and Area_Code with Road_NUM, respectively.

Communication & Networking Algorithm 
Figure 4 shows the vehicle states, channel operations, 
communication algorithm in several situations. The five 
states of vehicles are defined as follows. 
- NOR is the state of the normal car that drives faster than 
its predetermined speed. 
- FST is the state of the first car at the starting point of 
jammed area, which generates the traffic information 
including location, time, and cause of the traffic jam.  
- LST is the state of the last car at the last point of 
jammed area, which delivers traffic information to the 
vehicles on the opposite lane.

- FWD is the state of the vehicles in the middle of 
jammed area, which forwards information in Broadcast 
Mitigation Technique(BSMT) procedure for a multi-hop 
broadcast-based communication.  Since FWD is temporary, 
it eventually switches into LST or MDL.  
- MDL is the state of the vehicles in the middle of 
jammed area. In BSMT procedure, the vehicles that are not 
selected to be on FWD become MDL.  
In Figure 4, if a vehicle on NOR drives slower than the 
predetermined speed owing to traffic jam, it checks on a 
Jamming_data message reception to see whether there has 
already been a vehicle on LST.

If it receives Jamming_Data through D-Ch, it sends 
Chg_CH_Cmd message to the car ahead on LST for 
requesting channel change from D-Ch to S(x)-Ch, where x is 
1 or 2. Then, it also changes its own channel to S(x)-Ch and 
transmits Info_Req message requesting traffic information 
ahead, and waits for Info_Resp. 
On the other hand, if it receives no Jamming_data 
message, it changes its channel to S(x)-Ch and transmits 
Info_Req message requesting traffic information ahead, and 
waits for Info_Resp.  
If it does not receive Info_Resp for the time interval, Td, 
defined by (3), it goes into FST and starts generating traffic 
information including its GPS location, cause of  the traffic 
jam. And then it starts operating as the car on FWD. If it 
does receive Info_Resp, BSMT procedure determines 
whether it goes into MDL or FWD.  
If it is determined to be on MDL, it changes its channel 
to D-Ch. On the other hand, if it is determined to be on FWD, 
it checks whether it receives Info_Req. If it does, it sends 
Info_Resp containing traffic information coming from the 
vehicle on FST to the vehicle in the rear and it changes its 
state into MDL 
However, if it does not receive Info_Req, it goes into 
LST, changes its channel to D-Ch, and start to periodically 
send Jamming_Data built with traffic information from itself 
and the vehicle on FST to the car on the opposite lane. The 
transmission period is given by (10) below. 
When the car on LST receives Chg_CH_Cmd while 
periodically sending Jamming_data, it stops sending 
Jamming_data, changes its channel to S(x)-Ch, and starts 
operating as the car on FWD.   
And if all vehicles drive faster than the predetermined 
speed, they go into NOR. 
 
D. 
Broadcasting by Broadcast Storm Mitigation 
Technique 
The multi-channels as with S(x)-Ch and D-Ch in this 
paper, generally show higher performance than the single-
channel since it can mitigate collision and interference. In 
our scheme, the traffic information from the first car should 
be broadcasted to the cars in the rear through S(x)-Ch or 
sometimes it should be propagated to the cars in the middle 
of traffic jam through multi-hop communication. Note that 
the broadcast-based scheme may cause serious problems, 
e.g., broadcast storm, which results in severe performance 
degradation. To address this problem, we utilize Slotted 1-
Persistence Broadcasting Rule [5]. We briefly introduce the 
rule for understanding. 
Upon receiving a packet, a node checks the packet ID 
and rebroadcasts with the pre-determined probability 1 at the 
assigned time slot TSij, as expressed by Eq. 1, if it receives 
the packet for the first time and has not received any 
duplicates before its assigned time slot. Given the relative 
distance between nodes i and j, Dij, the average radio range 
of a wireless link, R, and the predetermined number of slots 
NS, TSij can be calculated as 


In BSTM procedure, each car becomes on MDL if it 
receives Info_Resp within its own waiting time derived from 
(1). Otherwise, it becomes on FWD and retransmits 
Info_Resp. After retransmitting, if it receives Info_Resp 
from the rear within Td, it goes into MDL since it is a 
forwarder in the middle of the multi-hop message path. 
Otherwise, it goes into FWD since it is the last forwarder in 
the multi-hop message path.

E. 
Broadcast  Rate Control based on  the car speed  
In this section, we consider the broadcast rate (BR) of 
traffic information through D-Ch. If the broadcast rate 
increases, the probability of message collision increases due 
to increasing interference and traffic load within radio range. 
However, if the broadcast rate decreases, it becomes 
increasingly possible that the cars driving fast may have no 
chance to communicate each other. Thus, the broadcast rate 
should be carefully determined by vehicle speed, radio range, 
message length, transmission speed of media.  
For example, if the vehicle speed is high, the broadcast 
rate, BR, of each vehicle should be high because the vehicle 
density in coverage range probabilistically decreases. On the 
other hand, if the vehicle speed is low, the broadcast rate of 
each vehicle should be low because the vehicle density in 
coverage range probabilistically increases. In other words, it 
is desirable to keep the network within a stable range of the 
total network load by adjusting the broadcast rate. 
Additionally, when the vehicle speed becomes lower, the 
cars stay longer in communication range and thus have the 
increasing communication success rate even with low 
broadcast rate. On the other hand, if the vehicle speed is 
higher, the cars stay shorter in communication range and the 
high 
broadcast 
rate 
is 
desirable 
to 
increase 
the 
communication success rate.  
Therefore, BR of D-Ch is determined by (10) under 
assumption that the maximum (maxSv) and minimum of the 
vehicle speed is 200km/h and 0km/h, respectively.  
S denotes the transmission speed of a wireless link. Lf

Experimental System and Test 
Figure 5 shows our experimental setup comprised of a 
main module and a communication module for vehicle-to-
vehicle communication. The main module adopts S5PX100 
with ARM Cortex-A8 Core. The peripheral includes a TFT 
LCD, a General Camera Interface, and a GPS. It also 
includes USB host/client, IEEE802.11a/b/g, UART for 
interfacing with external devices. 
Android is used as the operating systems for the main 
module. Several functions are established on the main 
module including user interface, navigation/GPS showing 
the jammed area by the proposed algorithm, message 
transmitting and receiving blocks.  
We use ATmega1281 MCU and CC2520 supporting 
IEEE802.15.4 for the communication module. It also 
supports UART communication to cooperate with the main 
module.  The proposed vehicle-to-vehicle communication is 
based on IEEE802.15.4 but modified to rely on broadcast 
while excluding Join and Association procedures. 
 
Wireless Communication Unit
 
Figure 5. Experimental Setup 
 
We conducted experiments where S and Lf are set to 
250kbps and 54bytes, respectively. R is approximately 
200m. Considering GPS accuracy, Ns is set to 5. The car 
speed, Sv, was selected randomly from 30 to 70 km/h at the 
start coordinate of latitude 36.385216 and longitude 
127.359576. We monitored communication messages by 
using cc2420EB packet sniffer. 
Our monitoring results showed that the vehicle speed of 
50km/h causes no packet error and no packet loss although it 
slightly affects Link Quality Indicator calculated by 
RSS(LQI). As the vehicle speed becomes higher, the packet 
error and the packet loss occur more frequently because of 
wireless signal fading, which is a unique feature of

IEEE802.15.4. Therefore, IEEE802.11p is considerable for 
communication between vehicles driving at high speed. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a traffic information service simply relying 
on the existing Navigation/GPS systems in vehicles and 
wireless communication devices for vehicle-to-vehicle 
communication, rather than on a separately established 
server. The proposed scheme collects traffic information 
over inter-vehicle networks, processes it to minimize the size, 
and transmits it to the destinations. This scheme uses three 
wireless communication channels and only a single selected 
last-vehicle is allowed to transmit the traffic information to 
the opposite lanes, which reduces the probability of wireless 
communication collision and mitigates the broadcast storm. 
Compared to the existing TPEG service, it has more 
advantages that it provides traffic information in timely 
manner and it can offer no charge service as well. We tested 
using IEEE802.15.4 based Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) 
platform. For future work, we will apply the algorithm to 
IEEE802.11p 
based 
Wireless 
Access 
in 
Vehicular 
Environment(WAVE) platform.
