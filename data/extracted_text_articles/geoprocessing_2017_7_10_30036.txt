INTRODUCTION
This research is focussed on the integration of knowledge
resources referring to universal classiﬁcation and application
components for solving complex tasks, e.g., for knowledge
mining. Target of the research is a methodology integrating
knowledge resources and specialised application components
for a gain in knowledge, cognition, and insight. The integration
of knowledge discovery and decision making processes can
result in extremely challenging tasks.
The quality of results from knowledge mining is primar-
ily connected with content and algorithms. The language or
method used for expressing a ‘question’ and automating its
translation in general is not of concern for this research. Data
resources, whatever their size is, do not automatically deliver
high quality results. In most cases, content and algorithms
are limiting possibilities to answer complex and staggered
questions in reasonable ways. Contributions to these deﬁcien-
cies result from data, algorithms, and their implementations.
Therefore, high quality knowledge resources, including fac-
tual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge,
description, and documentation are increasingly important. In
consequence, advancing methodologies for knowledge mining
is in the focus with comparable importance.
Several disciplines contribute and specialised approaches
and solutions have to be used on context for coping with any
slightly complex question. Built on such in-deﬁcit foundation,
there is no direct and common practice on how to integrate
specialised algorithms and applications with each other without
a methodology. Appropriate methodologies will allow to inte-
grate advanced knowledge resources and to modularise several
tasks within a knowledge mining workﬂow.
The motivation for this research results from the unsat-
isfactory and non-knowledge centric instruments available.
For many knowledge mining challenges, e.g., seeking good
answers to complex questions, there are no solutions available
for integrating complex knowledge resources and arbitrary
application components. A sample question is:
Which natural events associated with the creation of crater
structures with a diameter larger than 100 m could have been
directly notable by human population within the last thousands
of years and are still observable on-land at the area of todays’
continent of Europe and which knowledge is associated with
such events?
The question is quite precise but present possibilities mostly
cannot achieve appropriately precise results in order to answer
such questions. If one is not satisﬁed with arbitrary lists of
hundreds of snippets of information mostly not part of an
answer instead of an on-topic result then we have to ﬁnd better
ways. A solution is to ﬂexibly integrate high quality data with
conceptual knowledge and suitable application components
with appropriate features.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II introduces
the methodology applied for knowledge mining. Section III
discusses implementation and case study, resulting references
and associations, and the workﬂow implementation. Section IV
discusses the results from the application of the methodology
and implementation, based on previous work and re-usable
components. Section V summarises the lessons learned, con-
clusions, and future work.

METHODOLOGY
With this research, a methodology is deﬁned by a sequence
of steps. The steps can be a set of procedures in order to create
a result for a knowledge mining process, e.g., with a discovery
process. The procedures can include data, knowledge, formal
descriptions, and implementations, e.g., collecting data, retriev-
ing information, and algorithmic speciﬁcations. The purpose
can range from delivering to creating and answer to an open
question, e.g., delivering knowledge for a learning or decision
making process. The methodology uses a formal description

of knowledge, data and information, as well as required
research techniques. Content and context are represented by
any knowledge objects and data available in time and space.
Data may be structured and unstructured.
1a) Identiﬁcation of a knowledge mining challenge.
1b) Phrasing of a problem or question.
1c) Identiﬁcation of a solution or answering strategy.
1d) Context description and modeling.
1e) Mapping of sub-challenges to possible partial solutions.
1f) Interface creation for partial solutions.
2a) Creation and / or selection of cogwheel modules (modu-
larisation into sub-challenges and partial solutions).
2b) Knowledge and information: Identiﬁcation or creation
and / or selection of nuclei and facets.
2c) Peeling of information-nuclei from existing evidence.
2d) Milling of nuclei.
2e) Information processing.
2f) Data selection including nuclei and facets.
2g) Information object turnaround.
3a) Workﬂow implementation (incl. cogwheel modules).
3b) Analysis of results.
3c) Learning process and persistent documentation.
3d) Improvement process.
We can identify three main groups within the methodology. 1a)
to 1f) is a preparatory phase, 2a) to 2g) describes a gearbox
of knowledge mining, and 3a) to 3d) is a consecutive phase.
The modules allow to assign specialised applications and
specialised features to separate modules as will be shown in
the following implementation. Options and features of spe-
cialised applications can be documented, including conceptual
knowledge, with the learning process and to cope with re-
occurring requirements. The methodology allows to create
different approaches for a workﬂow.
III.
IMPLEMENTATION AND CASE STUDY
The methodology was applied to practical situations. The
following case study presents a practical workﬂow implemen-
tation based on the above gearbox of knowledge, including the
required cogwheel modules with their mapping to important
components and steps, their implementation and results.
The starting point is the above sample question. The required
compositions of features and criteria can become quite com-
plex and are commonly not implemented in any single appli-
cation or component. Therefore, the integration of appropriate
application components can be desireable or even required.
The plethora of information from the knowledge resources
is narrowed by the conceptual knowledge, the references to
classiﬁcations, e.g., to the mapping and data of:
•
Craters (any, e.g., Earth and other planets),
◦
volcanic features including craters,
◦
impact craters including meteorites, . . .
•
conﬁrmed (and non-conﬁrmed) structures/craters,
•
structures observable on-land,
•
age less than (about) 9999 years old,
•
larger than 100 m diameter.
The respective workﬂow requires a number of special calcu-
lations as well as criteria cogwheel modules for knowledge
resources and spatial components.
Applying a universal classiﬁcation can be used to classify
the appropriate objects, the associated application components,
and the respective required options for a cogwheel module,
e.g., for the calculations and ﬁlters.
In this case, the two groups of components involved with
creating a solution are a) advanced knowledge resources and b)
knowledge mining including conceptual knowledge references,
spatial data and applications.
The deﬁnition of data-centricity used is: “The term data-
centric refers to a focus, in which data is most relevant
in context with a purpose. Data structuring, data shaping,
and long-term aspects are important concerns. Data-centricity
concentrates on data-based content and is beneﬁcial for in-
formation and knowledge and for emphasizing their value.
Technical implementations need to consider distributed data,
non-distributed data, and data locality and enable advanced
data handling and analysis. Implementations should support
separating data from technical implementations as far as
possible.” [1]. According to this, the implementation of the
methodology is as far data-centric as possible and allows a
systematic application.
The following sections describe the essentials of the cog-
wheel modules required, including the handling of the nuclei
and information processing. The sub-challenges are presented
with their mapping to applications. Relevant excerpts of data
and information are discussed in anticipation of the ﬁnal
results. The concluding section shows the workﬂow implemen-
tation used for creating the ﬁnal results.
A. Multi-disciplinary knowledge resources identiﬁcation
The knowledge resources hold arbitrary multi-disciplinary
knowledge (e.g., documentation of factual, conceptual, proce-
dural, and metacognitive knowledge), in various structures as
well as unstructured, objects, and references, including infor-
mation on digital objects and realia objects, e.g., media objects
and archived physical specimen. These resources provide the
prerequisites in order to create efﬁcient cogwheel modules
and handle knowledge and information nuclei and facets for
peeling and milling processes.
1) Factual knowledge: The knowledge resources also con-
tain information on various types of crater features like vol-
canic craters and impact craters. Especially, the Earth’s impact
crater container in the knowledge resources container holds
data and references for all known impact craters on Earth.
The impact features container holds the Kaali impact, rep-
resented by its major impact crater. The minor craters of this
impact event are referenced from this object and form sub-
objects, all of which contain their factual and referenced data.
Figure 1 shows a spatial presentation of terrestrial (me-
teorite) impact features resulting from the impact features
container. The multi-disciplinary knowledge resources were
used to create various computational views of impact craters on
Earth [2]. The multi-disciplinary views, including conceptual
classiﬁcations, enable an association of various characteristics
common with different collection information [3].

The crater ﬁeld consists of 9 known craters. Crater number 9
is the major crater. Craters 1 to 8 form sub-container objects,
which deliver the data.
2) Conceptual knowledge: Advanced knowledge from inte-
gration of universal classiﬁcation and spatial information can
provide new insights when applied with knowledge mining
[5]. The use of the Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC)
is widely popular, e.g., in library context, geosciences [6],
and mapping [7] as provided by the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC) [8] via the NERC Open Research
Archive (NORA) [9]. The small excerpts of the knowledge
resources objects only refer to main UDC-based classes, which
for this part of the publication are taken from the Multilingual
Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation Summary (UDCC Publica-
tion No. 088) [10] released by the UDC Consortium under
the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 license
[11] (ﬁrst release 2009, subsequent update 2012). Data in the
knowledge resources carries references to classiﬁcations, e.g.,
UDC, for any discipline and object, e.g., natural sciences and
history. Here, besides the central UDC:539.63 (impact effects)
and UDC:539.8 (other physico-mechanical effects), referred
top level groups for geodesy, cartography, and geography are
UDC:528 [12], UDC:910 [13], and UDC:912 [14]. Tables II
and III show excerpts of the conceptual data (UDC) used for
geodetic / cartographic and geographic classiﬁcation.

Composite classiﬁcation based on these top level classiﬁ-
cation references can refer to special items, e.g., cartographic
bibliographies, historical atlases, and globes. Summarised, the
classiﬁcation can be used as glueing component classifying
the knowledge object space and the implementation space,
e.g., respective resources, objects, application components, and
features of application components. This also provides the base
for the creation of conceptual knowledge objects.
B. Geoscientiﬁc data and components mapping
Appropriate data was required for the topographic data
related criteria. In the past, the georeferenced objects have
been used with various data, e.g., with the Global Land
One-kilometer Base Elevation Project (GLOBE) [15] and the
2-minute gridded global relief data (ETOPO2v2) [16].
For the required resolution of the results presented here,
the knowledge resources had to be integrated with data
based on the gridded ETOPO1 1 arc-minute global relief
model data [17]. For special purposes data can be composed
from various sources, e.g., adding Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission (SRTM) data [18] from the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) [19].
The horizontal datum of ETOPO1 is World Geodetic System
geographic, which was established in 1984 (WGS84) and later
revised. The WGS84 speciﬁcations and references are provided
by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) [20]
and as EPSG:4326 from the European Petroleum Survey
Group Geodesy (EPSG) [21]. The vertical datum of ETOPO1
is “sea level”. The source elevation data were not converted by
the authors of ETOPO1 to a common vertical datum because
of the large cell size of 1 arc-minute.
The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) [22] suite application
components are used for handling the spatial data, applying
the related criteria, and for the visualisation.

C. Peeling and milling of context references
The knowledge resources provide references to multi-
disciplinary knowledge, e.g., photo media objects related
to an object. Examples are objects referred by conceptual
knowledge and contextual knowledge references (Figure 2).

The referenced citation entries are the result of the information
peeling process from the Kaali crater object and refer to
bibliographic references for meteorite craters on the island of
Saaremaa [23] as well as to meteorite craters in Estonia [24].
Other references point to information for meteorite-material-
usage, e.g., in context with archaeological and historical or
mythical context like King Arthur’s sword Excalibur (‘Ex-
Kali-bur’) [25] directly associated with Kaali (mother goddess
Kali) and its metal material and via association of sword
synonyms and metal object classiﬁcation to Tutankhamun’s
dagger [26] (made with meteorite iron from Egypt).
D. Workﬂow implementation and phases
For the case study, the required data and conﬁguration
is selected manually for the preparatory phase. The conse-
quent modules act on base of that data, especially concep-
tual knowledge and factual knowledge. The central cogwheel
module cogwheel_criteria in the knowledge mining gear-
box utilises a sequence lximpactsselect_crae_criteria
containing a number of components
1)
lximpactsselect_crae_date
2)
lximpactsselect_crae_confirmed
3)
lximpactsselect_crae_age_historic
4)
lximpactsselect_crae_diameter
for handling the criteria for the event date range, conﬁrmed and
not conﬁrmed events, the date range, and the crater diameter. In
this case the components can be considered as ﬁlter processes.
The spatial modules of the workﬂow (cogwheel_world,
cogwheel_region) utilise the features latitude and longitude,
wet / land criteria, criteria evaluation, spatial distance compu-
tation, map projection, and visualisation. The respective com-
ponents are provided by GMT suite applications, especially
pscoast and gmtselect. The GMT applications have to care
for longitude, latitude, elevation and contribute to the apply-
ing topographical data related criteria, for topography related
decision making within the information object turnaround.
The later association of knowledge objects, referenced me-
dia objects, and citation objects is supported by conceptual
knowledge and discovery processes. In the consecutive phase
results are analysed and persistently documented in order to
improve the knowledge resources and mining algorithms.
IV.
FINAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Earths’ impact crater objects from the classiﬁed LX factual
knowledge resources are used as a factual and conceptual
knowledge source for computing results, considering the re-
spective context and selection criteria. Result can be a group
of craters, ﬁtting to all the criteria, after the mining algorithm
is applied to the integrated knowledge resources and methods.
A. Result of implemented workﬂow
Figure 5 shows the resulting output, including the nec-
essary topography (longitude, latitude, elevation), data, and
information used, after the result was visualised via GMT.
Criteria for decision making are the resulting target structures
(meteorite craters) on land (topography and coverage), espe-
cially conﬁrmed Earth crater groups (meteorite impact features,
bullets, red, blue, and green colours), age and size of (on-land)
structures, and a reasonable catchment area for Europe (blue),
A catchment center has been choosen, a circular area with a
respective radius of 3000 km, automatically ﬁtted with the map
projection. The blue circle marks a reasonable area to cover
the continent of Europe in this context. The blue and green
bullets mark the craters inside that area. The data, items, and
marks are automatically computed and visualised.
The ﬁnal resulting object (bullet, green colour), which ﬁts
all criteria is the Kaali crater ﬁeld, Saaremaa, Estonia. The
region of positive ﬁnal result of the applied knowledge mining
is computed and presented via GMT, too. Figure 6 shows the
region of the Kaali crater ﬁeld on the island of Saaremaa,
Estonia in its topographic context.

B. Resulting associated information: Spatial mapping
The Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an eXtended
Markup Language (XML) based format for specifying spatial
data and content. It is considered an ofﬁcial standard of the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The KML description
can be used with many spatial components and purposes, e.g.,
with a Google Earth or Google Maps presentation [27], with a
Marble representation [28], using OpenStreetMap (OSM) [29]
and national instances.
The ﬁnal result from the knowledge mining with the clas-
siﬁed LX factual knowledge can be projected onto online
satellite data of the area of the Kaali crater ﬁeld. The result
from object and sub-objects is shown in Figure 7.

craters are marked in green colour.

C. Resulting associated information: Media references
The integrated knowledge resources can contain references
to any data, e.g., media objects. Media objects contain own
references, e.g., classiﬁcation, citations, documentation, and
keywords and can therefore contribute in many ways to new
insight – besides their intrinsic media content. The following
photo data (Figure 9) from the media references for “Kaali
crater” were delivered in association from the ﬁnal result of
the knowledge mining workﬂow.

CONCLUSION
This paper introduces a methodology for advanced knowl-
edge mining, improving complex discovery and decision mak-
ing results and providing potential for creating new insights.
A new practical knowledge mining procedure was success-
fully created based on the methodology. The mining proce-
dure was used for efﬁciently integrating advanced knowledge
resources and specialised application components for gaining
new insight and cognition. The paper provides the results from
the research and data-centric implementation of a case study of
integrated knowledge and methods for answering knowledge
mining challenges like complex questions. After the imple-
mentation, the case study concentrates on a context, which
is derived from knowledge mining challenges associated with
geosciences and archaeology. According to the methodology,
the major phases were applied for the implementation. The
paper presented the identiﬁcation and mapping of required re-
sources – knowledge resources and partial solutions, mapping
of complementary components in their context, and excerpts of
associated knowledge used for information peeling generating
a base for the information processing. The resources provide
conceptual and factual knowledge in integration with appro-
priate context data and application components for computing
and visualisation.
The mapped application components – tools and ﬁlters
– were used complementary for handling the complex re-
sources, systematically peeling of information nuclei and
facets, milling, and consecutive information processing, in-
cluding decision making integrating spatial and conceptual
criteria. The results of the knowledge mining information
object turnaround, can itself become part of the knowledge
resources. The methodology can be applied to many applica-
tion scenarios, especially where a solution can only be gained
by integration of different data and approaches. The various
approaches also provide potential for optimisation for special
priorities. In most cases, the optimisation can consider the
individual challenges and the use of special algorithms and
applications.
Future
work
concentrates
on
improving
the
multi-
disciplinary knowledge resources and creating, utilising, and
documenting advanced components for the knowledge mining
cogwheel modules.
