Abstract—This paper explores the merits of the indoor 
positioning system using Radio-frequency identification (RFID) 
technology for mobile robots. The indoor positioning function 
by the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Link 
Quality Indicator (LQI) method is developed first to determine 
the location of the robot. The RSSI and the LQI based indoor 
positioning system employs wireless signal intensities to build 
the intensity distribution map and compares the signal 
intensity of the transmitters obtained by the receivers to 
determine the location of the robot. In the end, the 
implementation is to use a predetermined indoor environment, 
which is set up beforehand to validate the RFID based indoor 
positioning system developed by a mobile robot. Validation 
results show that the precision of the positioning system in one-
dimensional is 10 cm and the average accuracy rate is 97.23%. 
The precision of the positioning system in two-dimensional is 
10cm x 10cm and the average accuracy rate is 79.73%. Finally, 
the average error of the robot tracking in two-dimensional is 
14.16cm.

 INTRODUCTION  
Currently, various kinds of robots are used to make work 
efficiently and avoid the dangerous situations for human 
beings. In order to make the robot perform the designated 
activities like human beings in an unknown environment, the 
robot must be able to perceive its own locations. By being 
able to perceive its position in the environment, the robot can 
then move autonomously to achieve its tasks. 
  For the purpose of knowing the location of the robot, 
different methods have been developed, including multiple 
sensors for obstacle detection in the environment such as 
infrared sensor [1]-[5], ultrasonic sensor [6]-[7], image 
methods [8]-[14], lasers [15]-[17], color belt method [13], 
landmark [18]-[22] and RFID [20]-[31], etc. The RFID tag 
includes a small RF transmitter and receiver. An RFID 
reader transmits an encoded radio signal to interrogate the 
tag. The tag receives the message and responds with its 
identification information. This study adopts the RFID 
method for robot localization for its simplicity and wireless 
features.  
In this paper, Section I introduces the structure of the 
paper. Section II introduces the information about the RFID 
system. Section III and Section IV introduce the basic 
principles of positioning and the positioning techniques. 
Section V introduces the system design and the 
implementation. In the end, Section VI shows the results and 
the discussion and Section VII is to sum up the paper. 
II. 
RFID SYSTEM 
RFID is a technology that transfers data between a reader 
and an electronic tag attached to an object for the purpose of 
identification and tracking via wireless signals and has 
attracted great attentions recently for its tracking capability. 
It was originally intended in industry as an alternative to the 
bar code and logistic applications. Its advantage includes no 
requirement of direct contact or line-of-sight scanning.  
The purpose of an RFID system is to enable data to be 
transmitted to and from the tag. The data may provide 
identification or location information, or specifics about the 
product being tagged, such as price, color, date of purchasing, 
etc. A basic RFID system consists of three components, 
namely an antenna, a transceiver (with a decoder often 
combined into the reader) and a transporter (an RF tag, 
electrically programmed with unique information). The 
antenna transmits radio signals to activate the transponder.    
Three types of RFID tags are commonly used, including 
active, passive and semi-passive ones. Active RFID tags 
broadcast their signal to the reader, and are typically more 
reliable and accurate than passive ones. They send stronger 
signals and thus are more adaptable to environments that are 
hard to transmit other types of tags, such as under water 
situations or those requiring a longer distance of 
communications. However, their required power source 
makes them larger and more expensive. Passive RFID tags, 
on the other hand, do not need internal power supplies and 
rely on the RFID reader to transmit data so that they are 
smaller and cheaper. A small electrical current is received 
through radio waves by the RFID antenna which has enough 
power to transmit a response. They are more suited for 
warehousing environments where the interference is not 
severe and the distances are relatively short. Semi-passive 
RFID tags are similar to the active ones with an internal 
power supply, but it does not broadcast any signal until the 
reader initiates it. 
III. 
THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF POSITIONING 
A. RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) 
RSSI [32]-[33] uses a channel path loss propagation 
model to describe the signal decay with distance. RSSI 
represents the signal strength. When the transmitter is near 
to the receiver, the RSSI value is larger and vice versa. For 
localization, three receivers are required at least. In the free 
space propagation model, the transmitted and received 
signal power ratio is as follows: 
           
(   )  
33

ICDT 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Digital Telecommunications

where Pr (dB),  Pt (dB), Gr, Gt, λ(m) and d (m) denote the 
received signal power, the transmitted signal power, the 
receiver antenna gain, the transmitter antenna gain, the 
signal wavelength and the distance between the transmitter 
and the receiver, respectively 
In an indoor environment, the received and transmitted 
power ratio is susceptible to both multi-path interference 
and shadowing effects. Therefore, the signal strength will be 
different from that in free space. In addition, the resulted 
distance will have errors due to refractions at edges and 
from the media, different propagation speeds, polarization 
and scatterings, etc. That is, the deduced location will not be 
at one point but will fall into an area. Therefore, the total 
received power from the tag has to take into account the 
effects of multi-reflections and other error factors which 
may cause the power loss. Thus, the total received power 
previously given is modified as follows: 
                     
(   )  
where Pref (dB) and Perr (dB) represent the power due to 
reflections and other error factors, respectively.  
B. LQI (Link Quality Indicator) 
 In practical applications, the total received power can 
not be used directly due to affecting factors mentioned above. 
Hence, in this study we use the link quality indicator (LQI) 
method for our distance reduction to avoid the problems. 
LQI [34] is determined by two characteristic of the 
receiving packets, namely, signal strength and quality. It is 
specified by IEEE802.15.4 to assess the quality of the 
communication link between a receiver and transmitter. LQI 
is based on signal to-noise ratio or energy density of the 
signal in the frequency band used and provides average 
correlation values for each incoming packet. As with RSSI, 
LQI allows users to assess the communication link 
considering 
the 
environmental 
effects 
on 
a 
single 
transmitter/receiver pair. However, LQI provides a more 
thorough estimate of the quality of the link than RSSI since it 
assesses all possible frequencies in the physical layer of the 
transmission. 
The basic idea of using LQI for distance determination is 
that the transmission quality is better when the distance is 
smaller and vice versa. In general, the values of LQI are 
expressed in binary digits of a byte from 0 to 255 with 255 
indicating the highest link quality. That is, the received 
signal is divided into 256 parts equally from the weakest to 
strongest by the manufacturer. 
IV. 
POSITIONING TECHNIQUES 
The positioning technique adopted in this study includes 
pattern matching and related algorithms as follows. 
A. Pattern matching location technology 
The pattern matching between the received signal and 
the database of the training samples for positioning is 
known as the fingerprint matching method. The matching 
process is divided into two phases as shown in Figure 1; 
namely off line (off stage) and on line (real time) as follows.  
 
 
 
 
∙ Off line (Off stage): establishing the feature database. 
This is the training phase in which the signal strengths at 
a number of locations are measured and recorded to the 
database first. The format of the received signal strength of 
each record is denoted by (       〈                〉  ), 
where (    ) is the coordinate of the training location and 
   (         )  is the received signal strength at the 
training point from the ith transmitter. Once the database is 
established, positioning can be accomplished by pattern 
matching between the received signal strength and that in 
the database. 
∙ On line (Real time) 
After establishing the database, real time position 
localization is performed. In this situation, a number of 
training locations is selected at which the received signal 
strength from every sender is recorded and the received 
signal pattern is then compared with the training pattern in 
the database for positioning. In general, positioning model 
will give several possible estimated locations combined 
with their probabilities. In the present method, only the 
highest likelihood location is selected. 
B. Probability-based method 
 Probability method is the use of conditional probability 
statistics. Under current conditions, use the current location 
of the user to find the most likely location of the user. 
Firstly, establish the characteristic vector for every training 
location to form the database of the characteristic vectors. 
The characteristic vector is denoted by    〈  
       
    
  
 〉, where the   
 
 is the     training location receiving the 
distributed signal strength from the     transmitter. Using 
statistical methods to collect all possible distributed signal 
patterns from every transmitter of the training location, and 
then to set the threshold value of the number of the correct 
matching data. When the number of the correct matching 
data is greater than the threshold value, the training location 
is used to estimate the position. 
V. 
  SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION 
The procedure of location planning is set in two steps; 
first, one-dimensional line planning; then two-dimensional

positioning planning. By varying the distance between the 
robot and the signal transmitter, the law of the received 
signal by LQI is established to determine the positioning 
relationship.

VI. 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
A. LQI statistics and the deduced distance database table 
For real time positioning, we need to establish the 
reference database of LQI versus known distance first. This 
is accomplished by fixing the transmitter location, varying 
the receiver distance step by step from the transmitter and 
measuring the corresponding LQI value at each location. In 
In Figure 5, it shows that how is the LQI reference table 
being established. It shows that at distance d1, the 
corresponding      is measured. Then, the receiver is 
moved to location 2 where the distance is        to 
measure    , and so on. The LQI values are measured a 
total of 30 data at each location so that data variance can be 
reduced to obtain an interval of the average value and thus 
to strengthen the reliability of the received signal.

Typical signal strength variations versus distance are 
shown in Figure 6 for four RFID tags. It can be observed 
that the signal strength decreases with some oscillation as 
the distance increases from 0 cm to 140 cm. For distances 
greater than 140 cm, the LQI value levels off to about a 
fixed range. The signal can be received to a distance as far 
as 1500 cm. It is clear that the gain of each RFID is not the 
same because the curves shown in Figure 6 do not coincide 
to each other. To unveil the reason of this inconsistency 
among the RFIDs, the antenna of the RFID is removed and 
the measurements are taken again with the same conditions 
as that of Figure 6. The results are shown in Figure 7. It can

be seen that data variation among the RFIDs is reduced 
considerably. That is, the variation in antennas of the RFIDs 
is the main reason causing the data spreading shown in 
Figure 6. 
The results depicted in Figure 7 indicate that the signal 
strength decreases as the distance increases from 0 cm to 80 
cm. The oscillatory variation shown in Figure 6 is greatly 
reduced. Furthermore, the decreasing rate of the LQI value 
is larger than that with antennas. For the distance greater 
than 80 cm, the LQI value is reasonably constant. The signal 
can be received as far as 8 m, shorter than that with the 
antenna of 15 m. That is, the antenna gain factor is about 
1.75. Because a constant LQI value is not suitable for 
distance determination, the LQI in the range from 0 to 80 
cm illustrated in Figure 7 is used for distance determination 
in this study due to the larger negative slope.  
 
 
 
 
B. Experimental one-dimensional positioning for mobile 
robot 
 
 
 
The average accuracy:97.23% 
 
For the one dimensional positioning experiments, at each 
distance, the measurements are conducted a total of 30 data 
for each location and the distance is changed with an 
interval of 10 cm. The results are shown in Table II. The 
number of false positing given in the table means the 
number 
of 
incorrect 
measurement 
among 
the 
30 
measurements at each location. The accuracy is deduced by 
dividing the number of accurate positing to the total 
measurement number 30. It can be observed that within the 
distance of 30 cm and at the distance of 60 cm, no error 
occurs. However, at the distances of 40 cm and 50 cm, the 
errors are 10 cm and ±10 cm, respectively. That is, at these 
two locations, an error of one measurement interval (10 cm) 
is observed due to the oscillatory behavior of LQI shown in 
Figure 7 at these distances.  
C. Pattern matching location technology to establish the 
signal strength database 
In the off-line stage, we establish the characteristics of the 
positioning database. The environment is divided into 36 
cells by an area of 10 cm x 10 cm each first. Then we 
measure the signal strength LQI of each position to establish 
the location reference database. In real-time applications, we 
use the positioning module and positioning rules described 
above to estimate the receiver position. Figure 8 shows the 
experimental environment for real time testing. It can be 
seen that a tag was installed at each corner of the four 
corners of the environment while a robot moves inside the 
area enclosed by the tags. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figures 9(a)-(d) illustrate the variation of the signal 
strength for each RFID tag. The result shows that the signal 
strength of the tag varies from the distance in the indoor 
environment. That is, the received signal strength is smaller 
when the distance is farther. This is true for all of the four 
tags investigated. However, it is also evident that at the 
same distance, the received signal strength from each tag. 
That is, when using the received signal strength of the tags 
to determine a specific location in the environment, the 
deduced coordinate is not a single value but during an 
interval.

D. E Two-dimensional localization for tracking the mobile 
robot 
This experiment is adding the mobile robot for tracking 
observation. Place the receiver in the mobile robot and 
observe the localization results. In Figure 10, this is the 
result of two-dimensional localization for mobile tracking 
and the tracking path is (5 , 5)→(5 , 4)→(5 , 3)→(4 , 
3)→(3 , 3)→(3 , 2)→(3 , 1). 
The wireless location signal strength is affected by 
fluctuations, so real-time tracking is a great challenge. 
According to experimental the results, it could be observed 
that the accuracy rate is low at the coordinate of (1 , 2), (1 , 
3), and(1 , 4). It is clear that when the robot makes a turn, 
the receiver will follow the turning action and causes a 
positioning error. Therefore, the robot must wait for a while 
for the signal to be steady so that the positioning results can 
be more accurate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Figure 11, it shows the estimated localization average 
error of walking path for mobile robot. The average 
localization error is 14.16 cm. 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
This study uses the property of the signal strength for 
positioning. The accuracy of one-dimensional localization 
without antennas is 10 cm and the average accuracy rate is 
about 97%. Therefore, in one-dimensional positioning by 
using the robot for adaptive positioning control is good. 
For two-dimensional positioning in the area of 60 cm x 
60 cm, the location average accuracy is about 79.7%, not as 
good as the one dimensional case due to errors generated by 
the wireless signal interference from the surrounding objects. 
To expand the scope of the present localization method, in 
addition to increasing the number of RFID tags, the other 
approach is to unify the antenna specifications with high-
gains.
