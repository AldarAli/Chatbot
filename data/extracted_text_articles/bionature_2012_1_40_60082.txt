Abstract— The paper presents the main results obtained in a 
Higher School Building, which are analyzed in view of the 
actual Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and Energy 
Efficiency. Measurements were carried out in one building, 
ventilated by mechanical system. Direct measurements were 
made with portable monitoring data loggers and in some long-
term 
measurements. 
The 
students 
assessed 
through 
questionnaires the IEQ parameters felt in the classrooms a few 
moments before the end of the class. The IEQ in 
higher/university schools buildings has been found to be poor 
because of the high density of students in class rooms. In 
particular, the Indoor Air Quality is a significant issue for 
these buildings in order to be healthy and comfortable for 
learning performance of students.

 INTRODUCTION 
The sector of buildings is, on a global scale, one of the 
largest energy consumers (together with transport and 
industry sectors), becoming essential to ensure a higher 
energetic and environmental efficiency, thermal comfort and 
health conditions. Due to high energy prices people are 
increasingly isolating the buildings and reducing the 
ventilation rate. 
Therefore, it is essential to ensure that they improve their 
energy and environmental efficiencies, but while ensuring 
the health conditions. Today we spend 90% of our time 
inside buildings [1][2][3]. The quality of environment air 
(outdoor) in cities of developed countries has improved 
greatly in recent decades. During this same period, IEQ 
decreased 
because 
of 
energy 
conservation, 
reduced 
ventilation and the introduction of new materials and new 
sources of indoor pollution. The growing demand for lower 
energy consumption of buildings resulted in the reduction of 
heat loss due to transmission by transforming the buildings 
into closed buildings where the ventilation rates become 
lower. This fact and the introduction of new building 
materials can often lead to unacceptable levels of IAQ [4]. 
There are some investigations that point to lack of 
knowledge about the effects of poor environmental 
conditions in classrooms, considering that this type of 
researches 
found 
inadequate 
school 
environmental 
conditions, far worse than in office buildings [5][6][7][8][9]. 
A. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and Energy 
Efficiency 
The 
international 
standard 
ISO 
7730:2005 [10], 
developed in parallel with the revised ASHRAE 55 standard 
[11], considers that a room provides thermal comfort if not 
more than 10% of its occupants feel discomfort [12]. These 
studies establish a relationship between the outcome of the 
energy balance of the body and the trend of dissatisfaction. 
ISO 7730 standardizes the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) and 
PPD (Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction) as the method 
for evaluation of moderate thermal environments. The 
standard recommendation for an acceptable environment is -
0,5 < PMV < 0,5; PPD < 10 %. Besides the general thermal 
state of the body, a person may find the thermal environment 
unacceptable or intolerable if local influences on the body 
from asymmetric radiation, high air velocities, vertical air 
temperature differences or contact with hot or cold surfaces 
are experienced. It was found that persons with lower 
activity levels (sedentary or standing) are sensitive to 
draughts, a undesired local cooling of the human body 
caused by air movement. Occupants who are subjected to 
draughts in winter tend to elevate the room temperature to 
counteract the cooling sensation thereby increasing the 
energy consumption. In extreme cases ventilation systems 
are shut off or air supply outlets are blocked off with a 
consequent deterioration of the indoor air quality. Fanger 
[12] developed a mathematical model to quantify the draught 
risk in terms of the percentage of dissatisfied people. In this 
model, the percentage of dissatisfied people due to draughts, 
DR (%), is calculated from:

where T is the local air temperature (ºC), v is the mean 
velocity (m/s) and I is the turbulence intensity (%), which is 
defined as the velocity fluctuation over the mean velocity. 
The first factor to take into account when carrying out an 
analysis of air quality is what are the potential contaminants 
that can be found, their concentrations and the sources of 
origin [13]. 
Ventilation is the process of exchanging indoor air 
(polluted) by outside air (presumably fresh and clean). The 
main objective is to create better conditions for humans 
indoors, taking into account the health, comfort and 
productivity by providing air to breathe (indoor air), which 
may be through the removal and dilution of pollutants, the 
removal of pollutants and addition of treated air and heating 
or cooling. 
Several authors have published about the effects of 
ventilation on health and finds that low ventilation rates can 
significantly worsen health outcomes, particularly at the Sick 
Building Syndrome (SBS) [1][2][9][11][15][16][17][18][19] 
[20][21]. 
Evaluation of IAQ in buildings, according to the 
Portuguese 
legal 
requirements, 
resulting 
from 
the 
implementation of European directive for building energy 
efficiency, are defined and specified in Regulation of Energy 
Systems and Air Conditioning in Buildings (RSECE) [22]. 
For new buildings, IAQ requirements include minimum 
values of air exchange (minimum flow of fresh air) per 
room, depending on the type of activity, and a maximum 
speed of the indoor air (requirement of thermal comfort) of 
0,2 m/s. For existing buildings, IAQ evaluation will verify 
compliance with same requirements, including maximum 
concentration of pollutants and maintenance of systems in 
hygienic conditions to ensure the IAQ (Table 1).

TECHNICAL WORK PREPARATION 
This present work consist essentiality in an evaluation of 
indoor environmental quality and energy sustainability 
conditions in a college/higher school building of the 
Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, located in a temperate climate 
region of Portugal (Figure 1), ventilated by mechanical 
systems. The study of higher school buildings has a great 
importance, not only by the large number of buildings in 
Portugal, but also due to the high energy consumption, often 
with low efficiency. Moreover, their occupations are usually 
a young population, in the process of academic training and 
are therefore more aware to these issues. It is worth noticing 
the extreme importance of the study to be undertaken in this 
research area, because significant numbers of evaluations in 
such buildings are not known, in Portugal. The School of 
Technology and Management of Polytechnic Institute of 
Leiria (ESTG) has currently about 6000 students and 
consists of modern buildings (Building A, B, C, D, E, and 
Library). 
 
 
Figure 1.  IPLeiria Plan View of Campus II - Building D. 
Building D (Pedagogic building) - The building is 8851 
m2, is a recent building (2004) and has a L-shaped 
implantation and have plenty of areas provided with glass. 
The building has a maximum valence for this type of use, 
which consists of many classrooms, laboratories, computer 
rooms, reprography rooms, auditoriums, rooms for storage, 
toilets, coffee-shop/bar area, offices for teachers, meeting 
rooms and passage areas. Its ventilation system is 
mechanical (heating, ventilation and air conditioning-
HVAC) and has a capacity of 985 occupants. 
Direct measurements with portable monitoring data 
loggers were carried out in the Building D of the Campus II 
of IPL, belonging to ESTG. The measurements were carried 
out in the winter and summer season. Measurements were 
made by long-term continuous and by point sampling, with 
portable monitor equipment always following best practice 
recommendations for audits of IEQ and Energy Efficiency as 
much Portuguese as ISO 7726 [17]. 
The study of indoor environmental quality and energy 
efficiency 
of 
buildings 
higher 
education 
becomes 
increasingly important, not only because of its complexity 
due to various factors, which emphasizes the large number of 
variables that influence performance, as due to its subjective 
nature and the fact that the buildings were made of areas 
with different purposes often enough and the high number of 
users. Due to the complexity of this research, analysis was 
done into two points of analysis: 
1. Energy analysis 
2. Analysis of indoor environment quality

RESULTS 
These results reflect the reality found in Building D 
through direct measurements and questionnaires made 
during one year. 
A. Energy analysis 
The electric energy consumption on Building D was 
compared to one measurement in the power station. Figure 2 
represents the diagram of charges in the building. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Diagram of charges in the Building D 
The measurement of energy consumption on a daily 
basis is a reasonable range of recording, it can be used to 
distinguish 
between 
weekdays 
and 
weekends 
and 
disaggregating energy end uses is essential to validate the 
model. 
The electric energy consumption verified on Building D 
was dissociated between the computer center, the HVAC, 
cooling and the rest of the building, as presented in Figure 
3. 
 
Figure 3.  Dissociation of Building D consumption 
The computer model of Building D (Figure 4) is properly 
calibrated  and  validated  with  the field measurements as  a 
way to improve  Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ)  and the 
energy efficiency of the Building.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  View of Building D (DesignBuilder) 
The dynamic simulation has four distinct cases: 
 
Case 1. The closest possible to the actual case study (real 
consumption of Building D – Calibration Model); 
Case 2. The reference values and schedules of the 
Portuguese legislation for Higher Education Buildings 
(Spain does not provide recommended values for these 
cases); 
Case 3. Conditions optimization (schedules, temperature 
set points, computers, office equipment and lighting 
improvements, lighting and shadow control). 
Case 4. Same conditions as Case 3 but with the reference 
schedules of the Portuguese legislation for Higher Education 
Buildings. 
The different case simulations are performed on 
DesignBuilder / EnergyPlus. The Table II presents some of 
the simulation results.

B. Indoor Environmental Quality 
The values obtained by direct measurements were 
validated by the thermal votes of the students and teachers 
to the same environment predicted by questionnaires, 
obtaining subjective results. Figures 6 and 7 present air 
temperature results in the winter and summer season, 
according to EN 15251[23].

Figure 7.   Temperature values recorded for summer season 
Concerning the thermal comfort conditions, it enables the 
analytical determination and interpretation using calculation 
of PMV and PPD index and local thermal comfort criteria. 
The values of PMV and PPD were calculated with 1.2 
met and 1.0 clo (winter season) or 0.5 clo (summer season), 
and according to the EN 15251 [23] (Figures 8 and 9).

Field experiments of local thermal comfort criteria, based 
in the local air velocity, temperature and the turbulence 
intensity, were used to calculate the draught risk in terms of 
the percentage of dissatisfied people (DR). Figure 12 and 13 
presents an example of air velocity and DR obtained in a 
classroom with different systems of ventilation.

Concerning the indoor air quality evaluations, a 
representative typical example of experimental CO2 values 
obtained in some classrooms is presented in Figure 14 for a 
classroom in a building with natural ventilation, for 
discontinuous HVAC conditions (because the system turn 
on and off all day), and for a HVAC Off/On conditions 
(which mean that the system has off until the middle of the 
day and after it has turn on). 
 
Figure 14.  Experimental CO2 values 
As expected, the concentration of CO2 and the relative 
humidity changes according to the occupancy conditions 
(number of peoples and length of time). 
Furthermore, the EN 15251 [23] suggest several levels of 
CO2 above outdoor, corresponding to different quality 
categories. For winter season the average of the 
measurements CO2 outdoor was equal to 458 ppm and for 
summer season the average measurements of CO2 outdoor 
was 401 ppm (Figures 15 and 16).

are high concentrations of CO2. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  
The measurements made during this study allow us to 
reach the following conclusions: 
There are some building intrinsic properties, which affect 
the internal conditions but another key aspect is the 
behaviour of the occupants and their actions that affect the 
internal conditions. 
The dissatisfaction due to draught is caused, in many 
cases, by air velocity and turbulence intensity. 
Results show and demonstrate that ventilation is a very 
important issue. Different operating modes can deliver to 
different results which might lead to take decisions, often 
unsatisfactory. The recommended solution is the hybrid 
ventilation systems. The key problem is to provide the total 
control system, sufficient but not excessive ventilation, avoid 
drafts, etc. 
Comparing the ventilation rates achieved, represented by 
air changes per hour, with the ones recommended by 
standards, and due to relative errors, it was concluded that 
the temperature of air, carbon dioxide levels, formaldehyde, 
bacteria, fungi and air change rates are many times at 
unacceptable levels. The measurements made indicate that is 
convenient to maintain the temperature and relative humidity 
of the buildings on lower levels of thermal comfort. 
The objective and subjective results obtained in our study, 
allow us to state that the building has acceptable levels for 
different environmental factors. 
Is also clear that modelling is a very important activity for 
sustainable construction engineering. However, there still a 
set of important problems. The full integration of energy and 
indoor environmental quality modelling and design projects, 
requires the integration of additional processes and 
especially, more research regarding how to make decisions, 
and in the manner of how the results of modelling can help to 
make choices in this type of buildings. 
The Building Management System (BMS) should be able 
to respond to these dynamics (the indoor air temperature, 
CO2 level, the automatic control of naturally ventilated 
building, occupancy, humidity, rain detection, outside air 
temperature, wind speed and wind direction sensors) and be 
capable of a resolution to operate both in the cases of high 
occupancy (high density), as in the cases of low occupancy 
(low density). 
More efficient temperature set points can reduce the 
energy consumption of Higher Education Buildings. 
Therefore, efforts should be made to reach new reference 
standard values. The simulations show that small changes 
have quick paybacks. We can reach over the 50% of 
improvement (Case 4). 
New energy efficient technologies are needed to achieve 
the new directives; the development may require an 
understanding of the mechanisms by which the indoor 
environmental quality affects humans.
