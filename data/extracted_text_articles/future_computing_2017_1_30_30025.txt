Abstract— A smart grid refers to a digitized and 
intelligently 
controlled 
electrical 
power 
system. 
Intelligent monitoring and communication of digital 
information can support two-way between consumers 
and providers. The work of this paper concerns modeling 
of dynamic pricing, potentially helping to improve 
efficiency of electricity consumption and delivery. A 
simple variant of collaborative filtering is applied for 
dynamically predicting prices.  Information on power 
consumption periods, and history of purchase levels and 
prices are used as input. The collaborative filtering 
approach is compared with a naïve forecasting method 
and the Winter method for incorporating seasonality. 
Actual price data is available for use in validating the 
models, which reveals that the collaborative filtering 
method provides the best results. 
Keywords- Collaborative Filtering; Winter Method; 
Dynamic Pricing; Smart Grid; Price Forecasting. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Collaborative filtering (CF) is becoming a popular 
technique of filtering for information or patterns using 
collaboration among multiple data sources, viewpoints, and 
agents, for large data sets. Collaborative filtering techniques 
have been applied in applications such as analyses of 
environmental data from multiple sensors, google news 
recommendations [1], Netflix movie recommendations, 
personalized pricing recommendations [2], financial data that 
integrates multiple financial sources, and electronic 
commerce user data. In this work, we apply a simple variant 
of collaborative filtering for prediction of electricity prices. 
The application environment is that of a fully instrumented 
and networked smart grid. 
A smart grid is a digitally enabled electrical grid that 
gathers, distributes, and acts on information across energy 
suppliers and consumers within grid infrastructure. A smart 
grid holds promise to improve the efficiency, reliability and 
sustainability of electricity services [3]. A smart grid opens 
opportunity for changing the traditional electric pricing 
system that is typically based on peak and off peak hourly 
rates. The existing price model for electricity hides the 
temporal deviation in the cost of electricity depicted in the 
pattern of consumption of electricity during peak times and 
off peak times. 
In this paper, collaborative filtering is applied to forecast 
prices of electricity consumed across regions. Our test day is 
from the ten regions of the New York Independent System 
Operator 
(NYISO). 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
applying 
collaborative filtering is compared with Winter Method of 
seasonality and a basic forecasting model. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 describes the related works. Section 3 describes 
current electricity market. Section 4 describes steps related to 
data used in this work e.g. data source and data pre-processing 
steps. Section 5 describes the three approaches used in this 
work, for predicting the price of electricity. This section also 
describes dynamic pricing input output model. Section 6 
describes the results of these predictions. Section 7 concludes 
this paper by mentioning limitations, suggests future use and 
possible improvement of collaboration filtering.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Collaborative filtering is based upon patterns that can be 
identified with limited details concerning the items or users 
under analyses. For the grid, the patterns can be such things 
as ratings, usage or purchases [4]. The idea is that a selective 
group of consumers of the same service shares a similar 
opinion with judgments based on their personal preferences. 
Filtering proceeds by matching the available information 
from a domain in which information shares certain 
similarities 
in 
nature. 
For 
example, 
the 
movie 
recommendation system Netflix uses collaborative filtering 
that finds people with similar tastes in movies, called nearest-
neighbors. Based on their history of movie ratings, the 
collaborative filtering approach recommends movies and 
predicts the rating for a movie. There are recursive 
application of the filtering for predicting such neighbors that 
is more effective in long term reusability [5]. 
Collaborative filtering falls into the general category of 
Recommender Systems [6]. Content-based information 
filtering is effective in identifying items similar to that a 
consumer preferred by analyzing textual similarity from user 
data [7]. However, the work presented in this paper focuses 
on finding similarities between customers pattern of 
electricity consumption that cannot be identified by keyword 
based searching [1]. Hence, the approach used for price 
forecasting applies collaborative filtering more broadly over 
content-based information.

There are several state-of-the-art works dealing with 
prediction of prices. For example, one recent study predicts 
hourly day-ahead electricity prices are using features like 
long memory, positive and negative price spikes, and 
seasonality [8]. However, this method is weak in capturing 
nonlinear patterns of price.  
Other reported works uses approaches such as Auto-
Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Averages with 
Feedforward Neural Networks [9], 3-Regime Markov 
Regime-Switching [10], and Hodrick–Prescott filters [11]. 
The work reported in [12] summarizes multiple methods. 
Concerning seasonality, there has been work reported on 
ways to identify and model seasonality [12]. As a benchmark 
seasonality method, the Winter method is applied in this work 
[13]. 
III. 
ELECTRICITY MARKET 
Consumption levels for electricity increases during the 
working day, peaks in the late afternoon or early evening, and 
is at a low point by midnight [14]. The graph in Fig. 1 and 
Fig. 2, shows average consumption per hour, not 
instantaneous power. One interesting point is that the 
required maximum power is nearly twice as high as the 
average power consumption [15]. In much of North America, 
the problem is especially pronounced during the top 60 to 100 
hours of the year, which may account for as much as 10–18 
percent of the system peak load [16]. 
The yearly consumption increases in summer, when 
people use air conditioners. Figure 3 shows that in the 
summer, the power requirement doubles for several days 
[17]. To meet this critical peak load, expensive combustion 
turbines are purchased and installed, which raises rates for all 
customers. A prediction model predicting real time price of 
electricity can address this problem and increase economic 
efficiency.

Figure 3. Yearly electricity consumption pattern in San Diego 
Dynamic pricing that is aligned with demand response can 
reduce the maximum annual peak load to save investment in 
expensive large power plants. Large investments in 
generation capacity by power companies propagate to 
increase prices of electricity. Power plant reliability and the 
uncertainty of not achieving maximum utilization of 
resources increases supply side volatility and contributes to 
increasing the price of electricity. Conceptually, the dynamic 
pricing model for electricity is a mechanism that mitigates 
uncertainties in the electric grid by reacting to real-time 
fluctuations. The real time price reflects the capacity of the 
power generation system through price sensitive demand and 
supply. Design of a sustainable model that reflects consumer 
preferences, behavior and response is a challenge for 
researchers in modeling supply side uncertainties.  
 
Figure 4. San Diego county average household electricity consumption: 
6,300kw 
These preferences, behavior and response of consumer 
can improve the use of electricity consumed. For example, 
Fig. 4 shows that a household consumes 62% of electricity 
for appliances and 20% for lighting. This 82% could be 
controlled and scheduled to use by making the consumer 
responsive to the price of the electricity [17].

ELECTRICITY PRICE DATA 
A. Consumed electricity price Data 
NYISO is a not-for-profit organization based on New 
York’s Capital Region to govern the New York’s electricity 
market. It administers and monitors the wholesale electricity 
market, conducts planning, assesses long term projects and 
develops and deploys state-of-the-art technology for a 
sustainable and efficient power grid in the New York State. 
The NYISO publishes the wholesale price of consumed 
electricity every day on their website. The data (Table 1) used 
in this research is from that published data. The total area of 
New York is divided into 15 regions, each region is addressed 
as one node in this paper. For the analysis in this paper, data

for 10 nodes are used. However, we could have done with 15 
nodes as there are 15 regions in New York electricity market.

The price of electricity is published for each node every 
hour. A day is divided into K time slots within a range of 0 to 
24. 
V. 
THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT 
The simulation is developed by in Visual Studio 2010 
using C# as a programming language. The reason for 
choosing C# as a programming language is to benefit from 
powerful .NET framework. The Visual Studio 2010 makes it 
simple and quick to develop and deploy a software project. 
Two Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are used in this 
software. The Window Forms Designer provides the 
flexibility to control the layout that houses controls (textbox, 
label, list box, etc.). The Windows Presentation Foundation 
(WPF) helps to control the GUI by event driven programming 
and the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) 
file. For simplicity and better visualization, Microsoft Excel 
2010 is used to hold the raw data. This provides quicker 
processing of data as the National Grid demand data is 
published in Microsoft Excel format. 
VI. 
 METHODS FOR PREDICTING PRICE OF ELECTRICITY 
In this research, three methods for predicting the price of 
electricity are applied. They are based on history (basic or 
naïve forecasting method), collaborative filtering and the 
Winter method for seasonality. The Winter Method is 
considered to be a difficult competent of collaborative 
filtering. This is because of the capacity for capture the 
variation of price throughout the day. 
A. Basic or naïve forecasting method 
For time series data, naive forecasting is the simplest way 
to forecast by making forecasted value equal to the last 
observed value. It is easy to use Naive Forecast and it can 
handle seasonality effect. However, if there is an unusual 
change in the last period, this method will produce 
significantly inaccurate results. 
B. Collaborative Filtering as dynamic pricing model 
In dynamic pricing model, the price of electricity will 
depend on demand, and the demand will in turn depend on 
several qualitative and quantitative variables, such as 
temperature, number of appliances, user sleeping times, and 
user consumption preferences. Consumer behavior in each 
variable is not known and response could vary by clustering 
one or more variables together. One of the benefits of 
collaborative filtering is that it models the behavior of 
consumers based on their response without such complex 
details. By complex details it means dealing with the 
mentioned variables. Also, this collaborating filtering 
approach works well for predicting user recommendation for 
movie ratings [1]. Hence the use of collaborative filtering in 
predicting electricity price is beneficial in dynamic price 
domain. 
Now, in the dynamic pricing model, consumers respond 
to the real-time price of electricity [18]. To calculate the 
dynamic price, the demand and supply must be forecasted, 
including information regarding generation capacity for 
fulfilling unexpected high demand (Fig. 5). The forecasted 
demand is based on user categories, such as household, 
commercial, and industrial. The user utility function is 
needed to provide a smooth estimate. The utility function 
considers the user level of satisfaction and behavioral 
patterns. By using collaborative filtering, user patterns are 
reflected in the choices they have made in their consumption 
of electricity. The output from the dynamic pricing model is 
the price of electricity for each group of users as well as load 
per power generator. 
Classical time-window or instance-decay approaches are 
inappropriate in such scenario, as they lose signals when 
discarding data instances [19]. The factor and neighborhood 
models can be merged smoothly to predict more accurately 
[20]. Researchers at Yahoo applied collaborative filtering 
with bilinear predictive model for many of their predictions 
[21].

nearest neighbor is done by calculating mean square 
deviation (MSD). 
Each node in the previous time (yesterday) has its price 
for 24 hours (0….23). By applying the MSD calculation 
shown below, a Node is selected to have the closest behavior 
of the node for which price is need to be forecasted (Table 2).

The Price of the most similar node in the previous time is 
applied to provide the forecasted price for the current time. 
C. The Winter Method for Seasonality 
The Winter method of seasonality is applied to calculate 
the forecast, as shown below [16]. 
𝐹(𝑘) = 𝛼
𝐴(𝑘)
𝐶(𝑘 − 𝐾) + (1 − 𝛼)[𝐹(𝑘 − 1) + 𝑇(𝑘 − 1)] 
𝑇(𝑘) = 𝛽[𝐹(𝑘) − 𝐹(𝑘 − 1)] + (1 − 𝛽)𝑇(𝑘 − 1) 
𝐶(𝑘) = 𝛿 𝐴(𝑘)
𝐹(𝑘) + (1 − 𝛿)𝐶(𝑘 − 𝐾) 
𝑓(𝑘 + 𝜏) = [𝐹(𝑘) + 𝜏𝑇(𝑘)]𝐶(𝑘 + 𝜏 − 𝐾) 
This method updates a smoothed estimate F(k), a 
smoothed trend T(k), a seasonal factor C(k) and compares 
with actual demand A(k). The forecast period, τ is used to 
forecast more than one period in the future. The first and 
second equation calculates the smoothed estimate and the 
smoothed trend respectably by using exponential smoothing 
with a linear trend. These two equations capture the linear 
trend over recent days and the trend during the last couple of 
hours in consideration. The factor of seasonality is 
incorporated in the first equation above, to get the data about 
last time’s demand as C(k-K). 
For example, considering a day as a domain, then K =24 
(24 hours a day) and considering a year, K=12 (12 months in 
a year). The parameters  𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛿  are smoothing 
constants between 0 and 1 either chosen or defined by the 
lowest mean square deviation (MSD) for the best 
performance in the test data. In this experiment, 𝛼 = 0.10,
𝛽 = 0.10, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛿 = 0.10 are applied. Different combination 
of values of 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛿 was applied to find the lowest RMS 
value and the 0.1 value for 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛿 provides the lowest 
RMS. That's why 0.1 was uesed. Other combinations of 𝛼, 𝛽 
and 𝛿 could be used but they won't be optimized. 
In this work, a machine learning algorithm, to determine 
smoothing constants dynamically, has been applied. 
The following equations give the formula for MSD and 
Root Mean Square (RMS) values with k = 1, 2…K.

𝐾

As a benchmark, a 𝜖 A and A is set of actual price of 
electricity used to measure the effectiveness of the forecasted 
price. Since price could vary hence is an element of A e.g. a. 
Also, b 𝜖 B and B represents the price for the day before (Fig. 
6). Again, n 𝜖 N and N represents number of nodes which are 
regions in the study area (in this case New York). M 
represents matched node with lowest MSD with the node for 
consideration and W is the forecasted price by applying the 
Winter Method for seasonality. R is the MSD values 
calculated while searching for the match node. For comparing 
the MSD values among three forecasting method s 𝜖 S is 
used. For applying the Winter Method for seasonality, e 𝜖 E 
represents the smoothed estimate, t 𝜖 T and T represents the 
smoothed trend which is the seasonality effect over the period 
of time, c 𝜖  C represents the seasonal factor and f 𝜖  F 
represents the forecasted price of electricity.

In the algorithm for finding best forecasting method for 
forecasting the price of electricity (Fig. 6), best forecasting 
method is determined by finding the forecasting method with 
lowest MSD.  Collaborative Filtering (CF) and the Winter 
Method is compared. For collaborative Filtering method, 
“getMatchNode” method by providing a Node to find out the 
best 
matching 
node 
with 
lowest 
MSD. 
Inside 
“getmatchNode” each node was compared except the 
provided node to find MSD by using “getMSD” method. The 
“getMSD” method takes two nodes calculate difference for 
all 
time 
period 
data 
available. 
The 
“forecastByWinterMethod” is used to forecast by using 
winter method. 
 
VII. 
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FROM FORECASTING METHODS 
All three forecasting methods are applied in 10 Nodes. 
Table 3 shows results of calculation of MSD for three 
forecasting methods for node 1. The optimum column shows 
the optimum value of MSDs resulting from each of these 
methods. It shows that collaborative filtering (CF) provides 
lowest MSD for node 1. This table is summarized and then 
extended into Table 4.

Table 4 shows the listed MSDs of Table 3 for all 10 
Nodes. This table 4 also shows that collaborative filtering 
gives the best results for 6 occurrences. The Winter Method 
shows best results in 3 out of 10 Nodes and for one Node the 
general forecasting method is best. The average MSD for CF 
is 148.99 (shown in the average row for CF MSD), which is 
about 39% of average MSD for the Winter Method. While 
calculating the Root Mean Square (RMS) value for CF, the 
average is 12.21 in a day. This means $0.51 deviation for 
each forecast price while applying collaborative filtering. The 
Winter Method, the deviation of each forecast is $0.815. 
Based on these results shown in Table 4, it can be concluded 
that collaborative filtering provides a better forecasting of the 
price of electricity than the Winter Method for Seasonality 
and basic forecasting.

Figure 7. MSD for different forecasting method for each node 
In Fig. 7, MSD for three forecasting methods are plotted. 
This figure shows that CF provides an excellent estimation of 
the price. Node 7 shows a significantly higher MSD. The data 
shows that the price of electricity in the day before was 
unusually high. By using collaborative filtering, such unusual 
behavior can be avoided. 
To compare these methods, a program was developed, 
shown in fig. 6. Screen shots for the developed program are 
provided in Fig. 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10.

VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Collaborative filtering is an effective method of 
predicting prices. However, there may be limitations related 
to covering the full factorial set of other possible factors that 
may influence price. Further testing is expected to include 
much larger data sets. Another limitation is that it does not 
considered price changes due such things as natural disasters, 
power outage for maintenance, transmission device failure, 
and generator scarcity. Working with such effect of disasters 
or their combination in pricing is of interest for future 
research. In this research, only one neighbor is selected (best 
match), i.e. K=1 for K-nearest neighbor (k-NN). Higher 
values of k could be applied to obtain more than one match. 
Finally, user preferences on the source of power (e.g., coal, 
nuclear, hydro, solar, wind) or an open market with pay as 
you go can be considered for future work.
