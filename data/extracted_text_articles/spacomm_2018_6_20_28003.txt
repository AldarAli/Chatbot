Abstract—In
this
paper,
propagation
characteristics
of
Gaussian-Bessel-correlated Schell-model beam (GBSM) in
turbulent atmosphere have been studied through simulation
and
experimentation.
Without
studying
its
quality
in
communication directly, we use scintillation index (SI) and
beam expansion to estimate such beams as signal lights. We use
Monte-Carlo method to generate the phase screen for modeling
the atmosphere in simulation. An experiment consisting of a
phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) and a rotating
ground-glass disk (RGGD) is used to generate a GBSM beam.
A box with fans and heaters inside creates a real, but much
stronger,
turbulent
atmosphere
environment
along
the
propagation path. Comparing to other kinds of beams, like
conventional Gaussian Schell-model beam (GSM), GBSM has
a faster speed of beam expansion and better fluctuation
characteristics in far propagation range while GSM and
GBSM have the same initial coherence radius.
Keywords- GBSM; generation; turbulence; propagation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Since the appearance of the laser, it has been used in
fields of communication, detection, illumination, imaging
and even in military for its advantages in coherence and
orientation. However, influenced by atmospheric turbulence,
especially near the ground, the front wave of the beam
breaks and the beam intensity fluctuates, which limits the
usage of laser in atmosphere. Since Ronald Fante [1] proved
in 1981 that a partially coherent beam has extreme
improvement on the intensity fluctuation, people have
studied many kinds of beams with different coherence
profiles. Besides the conventional Gaussian Schell-model
beams (GSB) [2], beams with non-Gaussian coherence
degree like pseudo-Bessel-correlated beams (PBCB) [3],
multiple
Gaussian
Schell-model
beams
(MGSB)
[4],
Laguerre-Gaussian
Schell-model
beams
(LGSB)
[5],
rectangular Gaussian Schell-model beams [6] have also
been studied in turbulence.
All of such beams with spatial partial coherence are
better than coherent Gaussian beam with respect to the
scintillation index. Moreover, the lower the coherence
degree, the lower the SI. Since so many achievements have
come out in this field, scintillation of GBSM still remains its
value for study. Thus, we want to further compensate this
work.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2, a method to generate GBSM is introduced in
theory and tested in an experiment. Afterwards, the average
intensity
distribution
of
GBSM
beam
is
deducted
theoretically,
and
the
intensity
fluctuation
quality
is
analyzed via simulation in Section 3. We conclude the paper
in Section 4.

GENERATION OF GBSM
A. Gaussian-Bessel-correlated Schell-model beam
The
GBSM
is
a
partially
coherent
beam
with
non-conventional
correlation
form
defined
by
Gaussian-Bessel function. Even though it has stochastic
field, the GBSM can be described by auto-correlation
function, a second-order moment of optical field U(r), as (1)

α is the parameter controlling the Bessel component, and β

To generate such a beam, we use a Kepler telescope

With Fresnel diffraction theory, we can find optical
field U(t) in (4) is Fourier transformation of U(s) in (2). It
has the convolution between an annular impulse and a

In the deduction of (7), considering the integration in
the third line is, mathematically, a Fourier transformation
of I(t) which is represented in (6), it is convenient to derive
to the last result by multiplying the Fourier transformations
of each part in convolution of I(t). By changing the
parameters of the incident beam, we can adjust the
coherence quality conveniently.
B. Generation of GBSM in experiment
From Figure 1, we establish an experiment structure to
generate a GBSM beam, which is presented in Figure 2. We
use He-Ne laser (632.8nm) as the laser source. Phase-only
SLM (HOLOEYE PLUTO) is used instead of an axicon to
generate a Gaussian-Bessel beam. After passing through the
telescope structure with RGGD, a partially coherent beam
comes out. As the glass is using 320 mesh quartz sand to
grind, the RGGD has a coherent length of about 80um,
making every 1mm2 illumination area include about 150
coherent units, which can be regarded to meet the demand
for δ distribution. The RGGD has a diameter of 60mm, 
when the optical axis is 20mm from the disk center, and
illumination area about 2mm2, rotation speed adjusted to
1r/s, the coherent time of the beam will be fixed at about
50us. To observe this beam, we use a CMOS with exposure
time of 200us. The beam in CMOS is presented in Figure
3(a). According to Gaussian momentum theory [8], we
calculate the coherence degree of optical field through count
the intensity variation from 2000 pictures and finally print it
in Figure 3(b). Even though the graph is not excellently
matching the expectation, we can still tell the tendency of
Gaussian-Bessel
function.
Many
factors
lead
to
this
deviation. The Bessel-Gaussian beam created after SLM is
not accurate enough. Crosstalk between the fringes exists.
Furthermore, coherence length of RGGD is still too large to

form the δ distribution, which makes the coherence degree 
out of its shape. Also, because of the improper set of axis,
we miss the details and since the interval between each pixel
on the CMOS is limited, it is unavailable for us to adjust the
axis setting to a proper one.
III.
PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF GBSM
A.
Average intensity of GBSM in atmospheric turbulence
The extended Huygens-Fresnel theory has the advantage
to calculate such complex random optic field. As compared
to the Rytov approximation, this method avoids to deduce
the first and second order perturbation from turbulence to
optic field, which is difficult and worthless. This theory
divides the entire field into countless spherical secondary
sources, and the influence from randomly varying refractive
on the wave front can be described by the widely acceptable
complex phase perturbation factor for spherical wave.
The atmospheric turbulence is described by turbulence
eddies and turbulence influences the beam propagation by
randomly changing reflective index. We deem that the
reflective index n(R) has a spatial power spectrum

represents the spatial frequency of
inner scale l0. Utilizing extended Huygens-Fresnel theory,
the average intensity of beam after propagating a length of L

where ϕ stands for the additional phase from the turbulence 
eddies through which the beam passes. We have assumed
the stochastic behavior of optic source and that of refractive
distribution are stochastically independent. The part in
angular bracket can be written as [9]

is the beam expansion which result from free space
diffraction and turbulence fluctuation. Through (14) and
(15), we can see the radius of annular beam profile has
nothing to do with turbulence fluctuation. Apart from
propagation length and wavelength, only the parameter of
Bessel function part has the ability to determine the ring’s
radius. Since the inner scale l0 is in the magnitude of
millimeter, when it is in short propagation length, the
second part of (15) is the majority determines the beam
radius, instead of the part associated with β. Hence, the ring
profile cannot be observed if T<w, or

Compared to GSM, the GBSM beam, with a same
coherence length, obviously has a larger beam expansion.
However, if the hollow profile becomes useful, the GBSM
beam may have advantage over GSM.
B.
Scintillation index
Even though we have given out the average intensity of
beam after propagating through turbulence, we have no idea
how the intensity fluctuation is. The Monte-Carlo method
helps us create a phase screen through which the optical
beam will get a randomly changing phase factor. This phase
factor represents the influence of turbulence on the laser
beam.
In
order
to
reduce
the
simulation
error,
the
propagation of laser beam is devised into several parts. For
each part, the angular spectrum method is used to calculate
the output field.
The scintillation index is a normalized variance of
intensity, which is used to estimate the intensity fluctuation
of the laser beam. SI is defined as below,
ߪூ
ଶ =
〈ூమ〉
〈ூ〉మ − 1.
(18)
For a communication application, a low intensity fluctuation
is of much expectation. Because the receiver always has an
effective area, leading to a so called aperture averaging,
analyzing the total energy fluctuation on a fixed area is
more helpful. And, since both the optical field and the
channel media have random characteristics, a large number
of samples are necessary. After about 2000 realizations, the
statistical result becomes stable.
First, we check the impact of Bessel parameter on the
scintillation index. We make α vary from 0.002m to infinite 
at which the light becomes GSM. Gaussian parameter β is
fixed on the value of 0.05m. Detection diameter is set to
50mm. Their scintillation indices on the observation plane,
which is placed several different distances away from
transmission plane, are presented in Figure 4(a). Same as
our recognition of relationship between scintillation and
beam coherence degree, the SI decreases with the beam
coherence length which, in this case, is determined by α, 
except the infinite one by β. Figure 4(b) is the responding 
beam radius variation, which is contrary to SI.

Even though we have studied the effect of coherence
parameter, the profile of coherence degree distribution is
still of much importance. As conventional GSM beam has
already proved to be better than coherent Gaussian beam,
we use GSM only to compare with GBSM beam. In this
simulation, the laser wavelength is 1.55 um. Coherence
length and beam width is fixed to about 3.5 mm and 14 cm,
respectively. The result of the scintillation index on the
detection area of such two kinds of beams varying with
propagation length is presented in Figure 5. According to
the result, obviously, the GBSM beam has a larger on-axis
scintillation in a short range, but it becomes the smaller one
in the long range. The reason of this result is unclear. There
is only a surmise of it, which is based on the evolution of
intensity distribution of GBSM. As the ring-like profile this
beam has in a short range, even it may be blurry when the
ring’s radius is less than the Gaussian expansion, the lower
level of average energy distribution on the center point
leads to a larger relative fluctuation. With the further
propagation of the beam, the ring of GBSM diffuses, but
slowly comparing to GSM, which making more energy left
in the center area. This may control the scintillation
increasing slowly.

In the last part, we determined the optical intensity
distribution. We saw the beam profile would become a
hollow. It is of considerable need to research the off-axis SI.
According to (16), setting α to be 0.001m and β still 0.05m,
after 6km propagation, the beam profile and off-axis
scintillation index is presented in Figure 6. The interval in
Figure 6(b) between two vertical lines corresponds to the
ring part of profile in Figure 6(a). There are two rapid rises
separated by the ring area. Without theoretical analysis, the
reason why it happens is unclear.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have analyzed the average intensity
and scintillation index of GBSM. Compared to GSM, it has
an annular intensity profile, leading a larger beam intensity
distribution. However, the radius of the annular profile is
fixed by Bessel parameter and propagation length, making
the
beam
somewhat
controllable
and
practical.
Its
scintillation index is lower over a long distance, but rapid
rise of scintillation index off the axis likely causes the
application limitation of GBSM. We have generated a
GBSM beam using a SLM and an RGGD. The result seems
acceptable.
Next, we plan to use this beam as a communication light
source, testing its application in communication. Since the
partial coherence of beam leads to intensity fluctuation even
in initial plan of beam propagation, but there is a time
average process when the beam is used in communication,
so it is necessary to analyze the influence from coherence
time of the source, observer and random media on
scintillation index.
