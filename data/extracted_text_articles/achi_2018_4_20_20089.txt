Abstract— We report on findings from a ‘state-of-practice’ 
survey 
conducted 
with 
Interaction 
Design 
(IxD)/User 
Experience (UX) professionals called ‘What’s Hot in Interaction 
Design’. We focus on 20 items from the survey which elicited 
practitioners’ usage of and attitudes towards personas. The 
survey items were derived from a review of academic and 
professional literature sources. The results show that 
practitioners think that personas have benefits, but come with 
associated resource demands and pitfalls, which we enumerate. 
We organize the results in terms of strength of opinion and 
discuss implications for methods, tools and curricula.

 INTRODUCTION  
A persona is a user-model intended to support the design 
of a software product by anchoring design within a vision of 
intended users. Advocates argue that personas promote 
empathy and help focus design on the goals and characteristics 
of users. They are, however, not without detractors and 
although it has been 18 years since the publication of The 
Inmates are Running the Asylum [1], there has been little 
research to systematically elicit practitioners’ attitudes about 
them.  
 
In 1999, Cooper [1] introduced the idea of personas as a 
way of anchoring design within a vision of intended users. A 
persona is a kind of user-model—a composite archetype [2] 
drawn from behavioral data from users of an existing or 
intended digital product. A set of personas can be created 
where each represents a group of users with similar behaviors, 
attitudes, aptitudes, and needs. Methods for creating personas 
have been suggested by Cooper [2], Pruitt and Adlin [3], and 
Nielsen [4][5] with semi-automated methods also being 
proposed [6]–[8]. Personas have a role in the three phases of 
the User Centered Design (UCD): User Research & 
Requirements, Designing & Prototyping and Evaluation.  
Despite the enthusiasm that some hold for personas, 
concerns have been raised about the resources required to 
create them [3][9]–[12] and their value to the design process 
[11]–[15].  A review of practitioners’ attitudes towards 
personas via a selection of articles on professional websites 
revealed views ranging from strong advocacy to skepticism. 
To our knowledge, there has been little systematic research on  
 
attitudes towards personas held by the people who might use 
them—Interaction Design and User Experience professionals.  
 
We conducted an online survey called ‘What’s Hot in 
Interaction Design’ in order to elicit details of the current 
practices and attitudes of industry professionals. The survey 
spanned many topics of which personas was one. Our 
motivation was as a stimulus for considering new methods and 
tools, to inform university syllabus development, and simply 
to record current trends. The survey was in two parts: (1) an 
initial part about Interaction Design/User Experience practice 
in general (‘main survey’) which included 4 questions about 
personas, (2) an optional additional part (‘persona survey’) 
that had an additional 16 items (hereafter referred to ‘A1’ to 
‘A16’ see TABLE I) which went into more detail about 
personas. Items were derived from a review of issues raised in 
the academic literature. The main survey was completed by 
173 practitioners. 76 practitioners went on to complete the 
persona survey.  
In this paper, we report results relating to persona use from 
both the main survey and the persona survey. We report an 
analysis of each item using significance testing and prioritize 
significant items using effect size (odds ratio) as a measure of 
relative strength of feeling.  
In the next section (Section II), we review background 
literature which provided the basis for the persona survey 
items. In Section III, we discuss the survey and analysis 
method, and in Section IV we report the findings. In the final 
section, we summarize the results and discuss implications of 
our findings for interaction design practice.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Overview on Personas  
Cooper introduced the idea of personas in 1999 [1]. 
Although a method for creating personas was not clearly 
articulated at that point, the idea attracted a good deal of 
attention. According to Cooper, personas offer a balance 
between formality and informality that carries more nuance 
than diagrammatic models through capturing users' goals, 
tasks, characteristics, and environments. The belief was that 
they could allow design teams from different disciplines and 
stakeholders to communicate about and empathize with the 
users and develop more focused designs. Methods for creating 
personas were subsequently offered that provided a structured 
approached to the development of personas. These included

Pruitt, Grudin and Adlins’ ‘role-based perspective’ [3, 9]; 
Cooper, Reimann and Cronin’s ‘goal-directed perspective’ 
[1]; and Nielsen’s ‘engaging perspective’ [4]. Cooper, 
Reimann and Cronins’ [1] method is a 7-step approach 
representing user-goals and including activities, attitudes, 
aptitudes, motivations, and skills towards a product. Pruitt, 
Grudin, and Adlin [3, 9] agreed on the benefits of personas 
suggested earlier, but propose personas as a complementary 
tool. Their method is a 5-step approach that looks into massive 
data and attempts to verify the quality and adequacy of 
persona representation. Nielsen [4][5], who observed 
variations in persona use, criticized some practitioners for 
failing to fully appreciate the potential of personas and for 
adopting marketing archetypes as personas. She offered the 
‘Engaging Persona’ process, which is a 10-step approach 
aimed at establishing common ground on gathering data 
related to user needs, attitudes and aptitudes and includes 
details 
such 
as 
social 
background, 
psychological 
characteristics, and emotional relationship to invoke empathy 
and avoid stereotyping [16]. The method also included some 
steps that focus on how to make personas accepted and used 
by team members.  
 
B. Studies on Personas 
Some studies have explored experiences and outcomes of 
persona creation and use. Blomquist and Arvola [13], for 
example, observed a design team’s first experience with 
personas. Methods for creating personas were relatively 
under-developed at that time and the authors found designers 
lacked confidence in using them for communication or design, 
concluding a need for expertise and integrating personas 
within existing knowledge and practice. Chang et al. [17] 
reported a small study with practitioners comparing attitudes 
of some who used personas and some of who didn’t. The study 
found more positive attitudes towards personas from those 
who use personas who found it an essential tool for design. 
The study also found practitioners experimenting with new 
approaches. Later, Miaskiewicz and Kozar [18] elicited 
perceived benefits of personas from 19 experts (practitioners 
who created and used them) and derived a ranked list of 22 
benefits, including: providing audience focus, helping to 
guide decisions, supporting collaboration, acting as a 
communication aid and guiding evaluation. Mathews et al. 
[15] reported a study of 14 practitioners and observed that 
those trained on Cooper’s method tended to champion 
personas, whereas those trained in Engineering and Computer 
Science were  ‘moderate’ persona users, and those trained in 
HCI and Design were pessimistic. The study also indicated 
benefits of personas in helping understand users' needs and 
context and establishing common ground.   
A number of literature sources draw attention to the cost 
implications of personas creation. LeRouge [19] argued that 
despite their cost implications, when personas are successfully 
integrated into a design process by trained team members, the 
benefits outweigh the costs.  Billestrup et al. [20] designed a 
questionnaire survey to investigate the knowledge and use of 
personas across 60 software development companies within a 
specific geographical region . The results revealed that more 
than half of the respondents had not heard of personas while 
the other respondents stated that personas were not well 
integrated into the development process. In addition, some 
problems related to time and budget constraints, limited 
knowledge 
with 
persona 
methods 
and 
inadequacy/ 
shallowness of persona descriptions were reported. 
Based on an observational study of design team 
conversations, Friess [11] questioned the benefits of personas 
as a tool for communication. Fries’ study showed that despite 
time and resources spent on developing and refining personas, 
they were only referred to briefly in designers’ conversations. 
Fries, however, resists the conclusion that personas are not 
useful with the observation that members of the design team 
who created personas invoked them in conversations much 
more often than other team members and stakeholders. Tharon 
[12] commented on the result that,  “Leaving the development 
of the personas to a select few on the team seems likely to 
ensure that those few are the only members of your team who 
will benefit from the time and money invested in the personas 
development.”  
 
C. Personas and Empirical Methods of User Research 
It is agreed across the several methods of creating personas 
[2]–[4][6]–[8][10] that personas should be derived from user 
research. The approach suggested by Cooper [1][2] was solely 
qualitative, involving informal manual clustering of users 
(based on ‘behavioral variables'). Such an approach has raised 
questions about possibilities of exploiting quantitative data 
[3][8]–[10], as well as issues of sample size [3][6][8]–
[10][14], adequacy of personas in terms of validity and human 
bias[7][8][10][14], and time and budget implications 
[3][6][8]–[10][12][14][15][21]. In response to such issues, 
some have proposed the integration of quantitative research 
and/or automating clustering methods.   
Pruitt, Adlin, and Grudin [3][9] were the first to combine 
quantitative and qualitative methods based on existing data 
about users. Their clustering method remained manual and 
was performed by experts in user research. They suggested 
validating personas through “sanity checks” and “foundation 
documents” to link them with the original gathered data. 
Later, Chapman’s and Milham’s [14] discussed the 
unexplored limitations of the former persona methods in terms 
of significance, accuracy, validity, human bias, and relation to 
the design of the product. The subsequent authors focused on 
bringing some automation to the process to increase 
objectivity, improve validity by increasing sample size, whilst 
also improving the efficiency of the method and making it less 
dependent on research expertise.  
Mulder and Yaar [10] proposed a mixed method for web 
design personas starting with a quantitative analysis of large-
scale market research and website log data and using semi-
automated 
clustering 
techniques 
to 
create 
market 
segmentation/user profiles, followed by qualitative analysis 
such as interviews, field studies or usability tests. Following 
this, McGinn and Kotamraju [8] suggested designing a survey 
with agreed attributes to collect large-samples of customer 
data. Factor Analysis (FA) was used from the initial 
groupings, followed by interviews with selected users to 
67

reveal the goals and motivation and to validate group 
membership.  
Maikenzie et al. [7] proposed Latent Semantic Analysis 
(LSA) for semi-automated clustering of qualitative interview 
transcripts data, proposing this method to be “more efficient, 
less subjective, and less reliant on specialized skills”. Brikey, 
Walczak, and Burgess [6] reported a study that classified the 
methods of creating personas in terms of manual qualitative 
techniques and semi-automated techniques (LSA, FA, 
principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate cluster 
analysis (CA)). The findings indicated that LSA semi-
automated method, when compared to the manual qualitative 
method, is not affected by the quantity of data, requires less 
expertise in clustering, is faster and cheaper, and minimizes 
human bias. The study also showed that the three automated 
clustering techniques didn't agree with the cluster assignment 
done by experts. 
In her 10-step approach, Nielsen [4] applies quantitative 
and qualitative research methods and considers manual 
clustering techniques (affinity diagrams and empathy maps) 
to be performed by qualified team members.  These 
approaches each in its own capacity have exploited at least one 
of the following: sample size, adequacy of persona, time and 
budget; 
yet 
all 
of 
them 
need 
the 
expertise 
in 
quantitative/qualitative data analysis for clustering users. 
 
D. Professional Literature 
We also conducted a review of professional magazines 
and association websites for articles on personas. Here, mixed 
opinions can be found along with specific concerns which in 
many cases echo those expressed in the academic literature. 
For example, Sholmo G. [22][23], an interaction designer 
intern at Cooper design agency, remarks, “For every designer 
who uses personas, I have found even more who strongly 
oppose the technique.” He reflects on his own conversion 
from negative attitude to positive once he started to develop 
and use personas “properly” in his work. He attempts to 
convince detractors to change their perceptions and promotes 
the use of personas for those who are unfamiliar with the 
process. Similarly Kellingley [24], another advocate for the 
development of personas, agreed with many of the criticisms 
under three headings: “Personas are time-consuming”, 
“Personas are expensive”, and “Personas need time to show 
ROI”. However, he argues that more time and money would 
be spent on building and rebuilding products without 
considering user requirements and personas. Accordingly, the 
attempt to reduce cost and time by cutting back on user 
research and abandoning the use of personas does not hold.  In 
the same way, Paul B. [25] discusses three reasons that lead 
some peers to adverse personas as design tools. First, the use 
of “Analytics”, which he argues can reveal many insights 
about the design components based on users’ interactions, 
overlooks how UX designers work and merely specifies user 
behaviors which is essential to the UX strategy. Second, A/B 
and multivariate testing assesses alternative designs in terms 
of quantitative results, but do not suggest how to reach the best 
design. Third, in an agile environment UX practitioners feel a 
burden when creating and designing personas because of time 
constraints, which again reveals that there is a need for better 
ways of fitting personas in the UX process. 
III. 
METHODS 
A. Survey Design 
The main survey contained 29 questions distributed across 
sections on: (1) demographics; (2) user research; (3) design 
and prototyping; (4) product development; and (5) evaluation. 
Section (1) contained questions asking the areas in which 
respondents had professional experience, the answers to 
which determined subsequent sections they were asked to 
complete. There were four questions about personas in the 
main survey across the remaining sections.  
The persona survey contained 16 items. Each elicited 
agreement with a series of propositions on a five-point Likert 
scale. Each proposition represents a possible attitude towards 
personas. They were derived by collating reported findings 
and opinions (explicitly expressed or apparently assumed) 
appearing in a range of relevant academic sources (most 
appear in the literature review above) and a selection of 
industry blogs. The propositions are itemized in TABLE I. and 
each is mapped against its multiple sources.  
Findings from previous studies were included because 
such studies were typically qualitative and/or longitudinal and 
based a small sample drawn from one specific contexts. In this 
sense, the survey can be seen as corroborating findings as well 
as opinions against a larger and more widely drawn sample. 
In some cases, sources contradicted each other. Here the 
survey can be seen as helping to resolve such conflicts. Thus, 
we believed we converged on a set of concerns that were 
relevant and might be profitably tested with reference to the 
experience of a larger sample of practitioners.  
It is not uncommon for surveys to use both forward and 
reverse-keyed versions of items to control for possible 
acquiescence bias. However, Sonderen et al. [26] and 
Schriesheim & Hill [27] argue that there is little  empirical 
evidence to support this recommendation and also 
demonstrate that it can increase respondent confusion and 
introduce difficulties in interpretation. In addition, including 
reverse-keyed items double the size of a survey which 
presumably can negatively affect completions and hence 
sample size. Hence, we opted for one item per proposition.  
B. Participants and recruitment 
The target population for the survey was UX/IxD 
practitioners. 
Respondents 
were 
recruited 
by 
non-
probabilistic convenience sampling via invitations to online 
interest groups, and by snowball sampling via the researchers’ 
professional networks. The requirement of working as a 
UX/IxD practitioner was included in invitations. Respondents 
were asked to give job titles as part of the survey and these 
were subsequently reviewed for relevance prior to analysis.  
C. Data Analysis 
Responses to each Likert item were coded on a scale of 1 
to 5 where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 
= agree, 5 = strongly agree. For each item, a lower bound one-
68

sample, one-tailed sign test was performed to assess 
agreement according to the following hypotheses: 
 
H0: The population median response is equal to or 
less than neutral (η<=3) (i.e., non-agreement) 
 
H1: The population median response is greater than 
neutral (η> 3) (i.e., agreement) 
 
Given the multiple tests, Benjamini and Hochberg [28] 
method was used to control for inflated type I error rate 
(αadjusted 
=.040625). 
The 
odds 
ratio 
(OR) 
-an 
unstandardized effect size statistic- was also computed for 
each item and to ultimately organize the responses in terms of 
strength of expressed opinion.

C. Results from the Personas Survey  
We report responses to the items in the persona survey, 
including results of a one-sample sign test used to assess 
agreement with each proposition. In each of the bar charts 
(Fig. 1─16), the left end of the red arrow indicates the lower 
bound of the 95% confidence interval and the dot indicates the 
estimated population median. Note that in a number of cases 
these values are the same.  
 
A1: Personas are time-consuming to create/use  
Fig. 1 shows that the attitudes to this item were mostly 
positive with median and mode of 4. 62% responded on the 
'agree' side of neutral (4 or 5) and 25% responded on the 
'disagree' side of neutral (1 or 2). A one-tailed sign test was 
highly significant (p=.0004 and p-adjusted=0.03125) 
supporting H1 (agreement). The odds ratio was 2.5.

CONCLUSION 
Existing 
persona 
studies 
are 
typically 
qualitative/ethnographic or case studies. They tend to involve 
small samples of practitioners with findings developed 
inductively. These studies are valuable for raising issues, but 
any generalization is problematic. Also, the claims in the 
literature are also diffused, uncorroborated and cannot be 
prioritized.   
The ‘What’s Hot in Interaction Design’ survey, with the 
additional persona survey component, represents one of the 
largest studies of personas that we know of to-date. It allows 
a quantitative analysis of the views of a large number of 
practitioners in relation to issues previously raised in the 
literature and which in many cases were a source of 
disagreement. It does this in a way that allows generalization 
and comparison between issues (i.e., prioritization). The 
results show that persona use is quite prevalent amongst 
IxD/UX practitioners, particularly to capture the results of 
user research but also to support design activities and to some 
extent, to support evaluation.   
Practitioners revealed strong opinions relating to 
challenges that are faced with personas such as the need for 
expertise in persona methods and expertise in qualitative 
research, as well as questions of user sample size and the 
amount of data required to create personas. However, the main 
challenge (high OR) turns out to be that, in the practitioners’ 
views, personas are not properly used by teams. 
Although previous research (TABLE I) included an 
agreement about financial costs (A2) and collaboration effort 
(A6), our findings show that practitioners had an overall 
neutral opinion towards them. The former might be explained 
by the fact that practitioners are more affected by time  
implications than they are by implications for budgets. The 
latter might be explained, not by a lack of collaboration 
difficulties, but by a lack of collaboration. On the other hand, 
our findings and literature tend to disagree on the question of 
personas lacking important information related to goals, 
needs, behaviors, and attitudes.

PRIORITY OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS PERSONAS BASED ON 
THE DESCENDING ORDER OF OR RATIOS. 
Our overall findings also provide an indication for the 
need for persona methods and tools that address the problem 
of using personas by teams and other challenges whilst 
maintaining personas benefits. It elicits the requirements for a 
personas tool that can support practitioners in their work and 
target the reported practitioners’ issues.  
In future work, we plan to follow up on the findings 
reported here by exploring them more deeply in an interview

study with IxD/UX practitioners and which will be helping 
further in the design/development of a persona tool. And as 
educators, given that personas are usually perceived as 
beneficial in the UCD, we would do well to include personas 
in our university syllabi but to find approaches that overcome 
or at least educate students about the challenges of resources 
and common pitfalls.
