Abstract—An intelligent handover decision system is necessary
for heterogeneous wireless mobile networks to fulﬁll user’s expec-
tations in terms of the quality of services. With emerging real-
time services, including multiple QoS parameters in handover
decision process seems essential. In this paper, fuzzy logic is
applied to enhance the intelligence of the handover decision
engine. An adaptive trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-based handover
decision system (ATD-HDS), which employs multiple decision
engines each optimized to a speciﬁc trafﬁc type, is presented.
The results show that, compared to a monolithic fuzzy-based
handover decision system, the proposed ATD-HDS signiﬁcantly
improves the decision quality and algorithm execution time.

I. INTRODUCTION
Heterogeneous wireless mobile networks require intercon-
nections of diverse wireless technologies such as WLAN,
WiMAX and Cellular mobile networks as illustrated in Fig.
1. Mobile users expect seamless services over a wide area
of mobility, with adequate quality and favourable price. In
order to satisfy the above requirements, multiple handovers
often become necessary. A handover may take place in a
homogeneous network environment (horizontal handover) or
in a heterogeneous network environment (vertical handover).
In either case some form of decision mechanism needs to exit
within the mobile device.
Fig. 1.
Architecture of Heterogeneous Wireless Networks
A horizontal handover decision [1] is normally a straight-
forward process as the decision can simply be based on
the received signal strength (RSS). However, due to varied
characteristics of different wireless networks, a simple RSS
based decision cannot achieve the required results in a vertical
handover decision process. Clearly there is a need for a
much more intelligent handover decision system (HDS) in
heterogeneous network environment [2].
Numerous fuzzy logic based solutions, which enhance in-
telligence for vertical handovers, have been presented in the
literature [3], [4]. However, in most of the existing work
only a limited number of decision parameters are considered.
This restriction seems to be due to the fact that as the
number of decision parameters increases, the number of fuzzy
rules increases signiﬁcantly, which leads to computational
complexity and very long execution time.
Nevertheless, for a more realistic evaluation of a vertical
HDS, an increased number of decision parameters must be
considered. Furthermore, due to the growing demand for
real-time services (VoIP, video streaming, etc.), the decision
parameters concerned with the QoS requirements (latency,
jitter and packet loss) are an essential part of this work.
In this paper, we are presenting an adaptive trafﬁc depen-
dent fuzzy-based HDS. The HDS consists of three dedicated
decision engines; each optimized to a given trafﬁc stream. The
trafﬁc streams assumed are: Constant Bit Rate (CBR), Variable
Bit Rate (VBR) and Available Bit Rate (ABR). The fact that
each trafﬁc type has different QoS requirements has been taken
into account in the design of decision engines. In doing so,
the total number of fuzzy rules have been reduced.
The performance of the proposed approach is compared,
in terms of the decision quality and execution time, with a
conventional monolithic fuzzy-based HDS design and Simple
Additive Weighting (SAW). Simulation results show an im-
provement of over 39% in the handover performance and a
reduction of up to 90% in algorithm execution time in certain
scenarios.
The paper is organized as follows. The related work is
presented in section 2. Section 3 presents a monolithic fuzzy-
based HDS. In section 4, an adaptive trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-
based HDS is presented. Handover decision system designs
are given in section 5. Section 6 gives simulation results and
comparison between different HDS designs. Conclusions and
future work is given in section 7.

II. RELATED WORK
As has been stated previously, numerous fuzzy-based so-
lutions for vertical handover decision systems have been
proposed in the literature. A fuzzy-based vertical handover
decision algorithm, which assumes interconnection between
WLAN and WMAN, is proposed in [5]. The decision param-
eters considered are: RSS, data rate, usage cost and user pref-
erence. The main aim of this work is to minimize the number
of handovers and the results presented are encouraging.
In a more recent work [6], minimization of the number of
handovers is considered whilst assuming RSS, data rate and
usage cost as the primary decision parameters. The results
show that the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the
total number of handovers.
A fuzzy-based handover decision for interconnection be-
tween WLAN and WiMAX is proposed in [7]. The decision
parameters considered are: RSS, data rate, and distance. The
main aim of this work is to minimize the percentage packet
loss, which is achieved successfully.
In all the above solutions, only the data rate is assumed to be
the QoS related decision parameter. However, recognizing the
importance of including other QoS parameters such as latency,
jitter and packet loss in the decision process, a great deal of
effort has been directed to evaluate the performance of a HDS
in the presence of multiple QoS parameters.
In [8], [9], bit error rate (BER) and RSS are considered
in their fuzzy-related decision algorithm. The results show
improvement in terms of the number of handover reduction.
In [10], a fuzzy-based vertical handover algorithm taking
data rate, delay and BER (along with other parameters such
as cost and security) into consideration is proposed. The
algorithm improves the process of wireless network selection,
thus avoiding unnecessary handovers.
Authors in [11] have proposed a QoS aware fuzzy rule based
vertical handover mechanism that considers data rate, latency,
jitter and BER. The proposed work is found to be effective
for selecting a wireless network that meets the requirements of
different applications. The results show a reduction in average
end-to-end delay and yield a moderate average bandwidth.
It seems that although it is important to extend the number
of decision parameters (which must include the QoS param-
eters), it is often not done due to computational complexity,
which results in unacceptably long execution time. Thus, a new
approach is needed that allows an extended number of decision
parameters to be included, considers QoS and minimizes the
execution time.
III. MONOLITHIC FUZZY-BASED HDS
A. Architecture of Fuzzy System
The architecture of a fuzzy system is shown in Fig. 2.
It comprises four components. Fuzziﬁer converts crisp in-
puts into fuzziﬁed data. Rule base contains IF-THEN rules,
which are required by the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). FIS
generates aggregated fuzziﬁed data, based on fuzzy inference
method used. Defuzziﬁer converts the aggregated fuzziﬁed
data into a scalar value (score). The score is then used by
the application.

B. Development of Monolithic Fuzzy-based HDS
In this study we have taken six decision parameters: data
rate (DR), usage price (PR), battery life (BA), latency (LA),
jitter (JI) and packet loss (PL). The corresponding input fuzzy
sets are denoted by g
DR, g
PR, g
BA, f
LA, f
JI and g
PL.
Each fuzzy set has three fuzzy memberships (low, medium
and high). With this combination the total number of rules = 36
= 729. Each rule is then assigned a decision output, which is
based on expert knowledge. This process formulates an output
fuzzy set, ˜Z, which contains seven fuzzy memberships deﬁned
as: very low (VL), low (L), medium-low (ML), medium (M),
medium-high (MH), high (H) and very high (VH)). Triangular
functions are used to express the fuzzy memberships in both
input and output fuzzy sets.
The crisp inputs (the values for each of the six parameters
offered by the mobile node and individual wireless networks
within heterogeneous network environment) are fuzziﬁed and
provided to FIS. There are two well-known fuzzy inference
systems, namely, Mamdani [12] and Sugeno [13]. However,
Mamdani FIS is used in this work as it is known to be well
suited to capture expert knowledge [14].
The aggregated fuzziﬁed data, µ ˜Zmono, is given by:

fork = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 729
(1)
where k is the total number of rules.
Defuzziﬁer then converts the aggregated fuzziﬁed data into
crisp value (score). The ﬁnal score, Scoremono, is calculated
using a centroid method given by:
Scoremono =
R
Rµ ˜Zmono(y).ydy
µ ˜Zmono(y)dy
(2)
This score is then used to make the handover decision.
IV. ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC DEPENDENT FUZZY-BASED HDS
From the above work, we note that extending the number
of decision parameters to six (with three memberships), a
monolithic decision engine generates 729 rules. This raises
113

the question of execution time. Furthermore, the membership
functions used are ﬁxed for all types of trafﬁc streams.
In order to deal with the above two issues, we are proposing
a new adaptive trafﬁc dependent fuzzy-based HDS (ATD-
HDS), in which multiple decision engines are employed, the
number of rules is reduced by considering the QoS require-
ments [15] for each trafﬁc type and the FMFs are tailored to
match the characteristics of the incoming trafﬁc.
The system consists of three dedicated fuzzy-based decision
engines, each matched to one of the three trafﬁc types, namely,
CBR, VBR and ABR. The Engine Selector (ES) ﬁrst identiﬁes
the trafﬁc type and then selects the corresponding decision
engine to carry out the network selection process. The general
architecture is shown in Fig. 3

The ES periodically sniffs incoming packets with sufﬁcient
frequency to detect trafﬁc activity. The trafﬁc type is identiﬁed
by receiving a ﬂag from the application layer. This can be
obtained from a commonly used session initiation protocol
(SIP), which runs at the application layer. SIP has the ability
to differentiate between CBR and VBR trafﬁcs. Thus, the ES
selects one of the three engines using the following logic (as
shown in Fig. 4):

CBR engine.
• Trafﬁc activity is present and VBR ﬂag is received - select
VBR engine.
• Trafﬁc activity is present but NO ﬂag is received - select
ABR engine
The number of rules is reduced by including latency, jitter
and packet loss for CBR engine, latency and packet loss for the
VBR engine and only packet loss for ABR decision engine.
By this matching process the total number of rules becomes
729, 243 and 81 for CBR, VBR and ABR decision engines
respectively.
The quality of decision is enhanced by using a combination
of triangular and trapezoidal functions to express the fuzzy
memberships. Furthermore, the fuzzy membership functions
(FMFs) are tailored according to the QoS requirements of each
trafﬁc type.
V. HANDOVER DECISION SYSTEM DESIGNS
Three HDS designs are produced: Monolithic design 1
(MD1) , Monolithic design 2 (MD2) and ATD design.
MD1 is a conventional design with 6 decision parameters
and all FMFs are triangular, with no regard to the incoming
trafﬁc type. MD2 has 6 decision parameters but the FMFs are
a combination of triangular and trapezoidal functions, which
are tailored to the most QoS-sensitive trafﬁc (in Fig. 5).
Fig. 5.
FMFs Speciﬁc to CBR Trafﬁc
ATD design has a variable number of decision parameters
and employs a combination of triangular and trapezoidal
functions, which are tailored to the incoming trafﬁc, as shown
in Fig. 5, 6 and 7 (noting that Fig. 5 is common to MD2 and
ATD designs).
A small portion of the fuzzy rules for CBR trafﬁc is given
(in table I) to illustrate the general idea. As the number of
decision parameters is ﬁxed in MD1 and MD2, the same set
of rules is used for all trafﬁc types (CBR, VBR and ABR),
and in all the three HDS designs. In contrast, the number of

decision parameters is variable in ATD design, so different
sets of rules are used for different trafﬁc types, as can be seen
from tables I
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To evaluate handover decision performance of the three
fuzzy-based HDS designs, we have assumed three wireless
network technologies (WLAN, WiMAX and Cellular) and
three trafﬁc models (VoIP, video streaming and ﬁle transfer).
Their QoS requirements are given in [15]
The performance criteria are the percentage success, which
is measured in terms of the number of times (expressed as a
percentage) the HDS selected the wireless network that had
the highest score among the three and fully satisﬁed the QoS
requirements, and the execution time.

A. Performance Measurement
Crisp input value for each of the decision parameters (with
the exception of usage price) is randomly selected from the
range given in table II, and used in all the three HDS designs
in the case of VoIP trafﬁc.
Similarly, in the case of video streaming, crisp values are
randomly selected from table III and used in ATD, whereas
MD1 and MD2 also need a value for jitter (JI), which is taken
from table II.
In the case of ﬁle transfer trafﬁc, crisp values are randomly
selected from table IV and used in ATD. JI is taken from table
II and used in MD1 and MD2, and latency (LA) is taken from
table III and used in MD1 and MD2.
The usage price for individual technologies is set at a ﬁxed
value and assumed to be incremental (i.e. WLAN to be least
expensive and Cellular to be most expensive [16]).
The range of values for decision parameters in tables II, III
and IV are taken either from real-life tests or commonly used
standards [17]–[21].

trafﬁc type. The above procedure was repeated to evaluate
the performance of Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) for a
comparison purpose. Simulation results are shown in Fig. 8,
9 and 10.
In the case of VoIP trafﬁc (Fig. 8), the performance of MD2
and ATD design have exactly the same performance. This
result is expected as identical rules and FMFs are employed.
However, there is an improvement of 37.4% compared with
MD1, which employs the same rules but ﬁxed FMFs, and an
improvement of 38.78% when compared with SAW.
It is interesting to note in Fig. 9 that the performance
of MD2 is slightly worse than MD1, in the case of video
streaming trafﬁc. As FMFs in MD2 are tailored for the most
QoS-sensitive trafﬁc, relatively less QoS-sensitive trafﬁc is
penalized. The performance of ATD design, on the other hand,
is 24.17%, 22.03% and 30.58% better than SAW, MD1 and
MD2, respectively.
In the case of ﬁle transfer trafﬁc, Fig. 10, a similar picture
emerges when comparing the performance of MD1 and MD2.
However, the performance of ATD is comparable with MD1
and is slightly better than SAW. This result suggests that the
tailoring of FMFs is more beneﬁcial when the number of QoS
parameters is increased.

As has been mentioned in section 1, minimization of the

applications. We have evaluated τ for the three HDS designs

Core 2 Duo with 4GB memory.
The results in Fig. 11 clearly show that our proposed ATD
design signiﬁcantly reduces τ for relatively less QoS-sensitive
trafﬁcs. The reduction achieved in τ is 70.05% and 90.37% for
video streaming and ﬁle transfer trafﬁc, respectively. However,
in the case of VoIP, there is no signiﬁcant reduction in the value

C. Battery Consumption Analysis
Our comparison of fuzzy-based algorithms with SAW algo-
rithm reveals that the superiority of fuzzy-based designs comes
at a price, i.e. the algorithm execution time of even the best
(ATD) fuzzy algorithm is much higher than that required by
the SAW. This raises the issue of power consumption and
the recharging frequency for the battery. In order to address
these issues we have made some projections based on the data
available to us.
Our simulations were carried out on MATLAB platform
using Intel processor of 65watts rating. The longest execution
time (worst case) for our fuzzy algorithms is 1.87 seconds
(Fig. 11). Therefore, the power consumption for the worst

case = 65x1.87 = 121.55 watt-seconds or 0.033 watt-hours.
Now the battery capacity of a modern smart phone is around
5.5 watt-hour. Thus, a smart phone can execute the above
algorithm around 166 times (this does not include the power
consumption of other components) before the battery needs
recharging.
If we now consider a processor that is actually used in
mobile devices (e.g. ARM Cortex A series of 1.3 watts rating),
the estimated power consumption reduces to 0.000675 watt-
hour. Assuming the same battery as above, a smart phone can
execute the algorithm for over 8,000 times before the need
for recharging. Further improvements will come from the fact
that an actual mobile device is likely to use dedicated and
embedded software instead of MATLAB platform to run fuzzy
algorithm. This will further reduce execution time and hence
the power consumption.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed an adaptive trafﬁc dependent handover
decision system to deal with the restriction imposed on the
number of decision parameters mainly due to the fact that
as the number of decision parameters increases, the number
of fuzzy rules increases to a very large value, resulting in
computational complexity and an unacceptably long execu-
tion time. In our approach multiple decision engines, each
optimized to a speciﬁc trafﬁc type, have been suggested. The
optimization has been achieved by tailoring FMFs to match
the QoS requirements of each individual trafﬁc type. The
number of fuzzy rules has been reduced, compared with a
conventional monolithic decision engine, by including only
those QoS parameters that are essential for a given trafﬁc type.
For evaluation and comparison purposes, three handover
decision system designs (Monolithic design 1, Monolithic
design 2 and ATD) have been developed. Assuming a het-
erogeneous networking environment and three trafﬁc types
(VoIP, video streaming and ﬁle transfer), simulation results
have been produced to compare the performance of the three
HDS designs and SAW in term of the decision quality and
execution time.
In terms of the decision quality, the simulation results
show that ATD design gives an improvement of 37.4% and
22.03% for VoIP and video streaming trafﬁcs respectively,
when compared with Monolithic design 1. The performance
of ATD is comparable with others in the case of ﬁle transfer
trafﬁc.
In terms of the execution time, the results show that ATD
design gives an improvement of over 90% and 70% in case
of ﬁle transfer and video streaming trafﬁcs respectively, when
compared with Monolithic design. The performance of Mono-
lithic and ATD designs is comparable in the case of VoIP
trafﬁc. Battery consumption analysis suggests that the power
consumption of the proposed algorithm is unlikely to have a
major impact on the battery life in real-life implementation.
Future work will investigate possibilities of further reduc-
tion in computational complexity and hence execution time for
the handover process.
