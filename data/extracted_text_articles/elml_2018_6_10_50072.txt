Abstract—To understand how software operates, it is necessary
to repeat an operation many times with the software. However,
carrying out a repeat operation that involves settings is not
easy. In this study, we use a snapshot of VirtualBox to restore a
personal computers (PC) to any previous settings state. As a
result, we developed a system that allows students to continue
exercises by restoring their PC to an earlier state or by copying
the state of an instructor PC.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, classes in which students use PC or tablet
devices have become more commonplace [1]. Students are
more accustomed to typing rather than performing operations
using software [2]. It is important that students be able to
repeat an operation several times in order to master the use
of the software. However, students are often only required to
imitate an instructor's operation in actual classes. In this
study, we propose a system whereby students can repeat
operations during a lecture.
In this paper, Section II introduces the problems students
face when acquiring a new skill, Section III describes our
proposal, Section Ⅳ explains the developed system, Section
Ⅴ evaluates of our system and presents a review by 
instructors and Section Ⅵ summarizes our work. 
II.
PROBLEMS
Instructors project their desktop display onto a screen
which is used to demonstrate how to use the software, and
show students how to perform the operations. Students need
to perform an operation repeatedly in order to master the use
of the software. However, students must restore settings by
themselves when performing a specific operation.
For example, we use “Data Analysis Tools” when
performing statistical processing with Excel [3]. When we
want to add “Data Analysis Tools” to the ribbon, we need to
check “File”> “Options”> “Add-ins”, “Manage:”, “Excel
Add-ins”, “Go…”, “Analysis ToolPak”. If the instructor
makes the students repeat the operation, the students must
restore the ribbon to its original state when “Data Analysis
Tools” was not added. Otherwise, any changes in add-ons
Figure 1.
Dialog windows for add-ins settings.
are kept when repeating exercises (Figure 1). Some actions,
such as the "Empty Recycle Bin" operation cannot be
undone, and if the registry is rewritten by installing an
application, it cannot be restored.
Students who are not skilled at performing operations
with software need to practice the same operation many
times. Therefore, even after some students have finished
practicing an operation, others may take more time. Even in
cases where all students have not finished practicing, the
instructor may have to move on to the next exercise and end
the practice session. As a result, the next explanation about
how to use the software may not be understood by all
students, forcing the instructor to delay future sessions until
all students have finished their work in the previous session.
III.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this research is to setup each student's PC
to easily perform repeat operations. Specifically, when the
students are instructed to repeat an operation, the new system
would restore the student's PC to its original state. Or, when
the instructor explains the contents of the next lecture to the
students, the system prepares the student's PC by loading a
state where it can perform the next operation. We propose
the introduction of virtualization technology to realize this
system. The snapshot function of virtualization technology
can preserve the state of a PC. Students can perform

operations from a preserved state by restoration, even after
performing different operations.
For example, snapshots S1, S2 are taken before and after
performing an operation in Excel (Figure 2). When snapshot
S1 is restored, the PC can return to a state prior to activation
of Excel, thereby allowing the student to repeat the same
operation. Even if the desired operation has not been
completed on Excel, the PC can revert to the state after the
Excel operation was performed by restoring snapshot S2.
Students can use snapshots on Guest PC. Guest PC is a
software function that emulates the working environment of
one PC on a Host PC (Figure 3). Students can use the Guest
PC without having to actively think about the Host PC when
using the Guest PC with full screen. However, restoration of
a state in the Guest PC can only be controlled by the Host PC.
Therefore, the student not only operates the Guest PC, but
also operates the Host PC to perform further operations
during lessons and exercises (Figure 4). Additionally, if the
snapshot was not properly taken, the state of the Guest PC
cannot be restored.
The purpose of this study is to facilitate the restoration of
a snapshot with 1 click on the Guest PC without the Host PC
control of the Host PC. Furthermore, restoration of a state on
a student's Guest PC based on a snapshot operation
demonstrated by the instructor will be examined.

DEVELOPED SYSTEM
The system developed in the study is shown in Figure 5.
This system is constructed from five modules. We used
VirtualBox
[4]
provided
by
Oracle
as
virtualization
technology software. Modules were designed for this study
using Java. A snapshot for the model operation to be
performed by students during lectures was prepared by the
instructor before the lecture.

A. Student PC
Module HOST performs an operation on the student PC's
Host PC, and Module GUEST performs an operation on the
student PC's Guest PC.
Module HOST imports snapshots by lecturers onto
student PCs. Then, Module HOST displays the Guest PC
screen in full screen mode. Depending on the control signal
of Module GUEST, a snapshot is either saved / restored for
the student or the instructor's snapshot is restored on the
Guest PC. These processes correspond to Table Ⅰ when
they are performed by existing functions of VirtualBox.
Figure 6 (A) shows the operation screen of Module
GUEST, and the sending of a control signal from Module
GUEST to Module HOST. The ‘Import’ button sends a
signal to restore the Guest PC based on a snapshot from the
instructor and the load button sends a signal to restore the
Guest PC based on the snapshot of the student. The ‘Save as’
button sends a signal to take a snapshot of the state of the PC
at that time. After progressing to the next session, the saved
snapshot becomes restoration point information available by
the ‘Load’ button.
Thus, students can use the Guest PC without having to
actively think about the Host PC. They can perform the
repeat operation or synchronize to the lesson with only one
click of Module GUEST.
B. Instructor PC
Module ROOT operates on the Host PC for the instructor
PC; Module PRE and Module CTRL operate on the Guest
PC for the instructor PC.
Module ROOT has three functions. First, it performs the
function of preserving snapshots of the instructor based on
the control signal from Module PRE. Second, the function of
transmitting
the
control
signal
that
determines
which
snapshot is to be restored by Module HOST on the student
PC is performed by Module CTRL Third, the transfer of the
snapshot from the instructor PC to the Host PC of the student
PC is performed with cooperation from Module HOST.
Figure 6 (B) shows the operation screen of Module
CTRL, and the restore points from all snapshots are
displayed as a list. The snapshot of the selected thumbnail
image becomes the restoration information of the ‘Import’
button of Module HOST.
V.
EVALUATION
We verified the effectiveness of the developed system.
For the purposes of verification, we researched possible
factors that could affect the actual operation, such as disk
capacity and transfer time, and asked several instructors to
review our research.
A. Performance
The snapshot stores all the information needed to restore
the state of the computer. The information includes not only
operations by the user, but also background operations run
by the operating system. The larger the size of the snapshot,
the more time it takes to save and restore a state. Tables II
and III show the size, the saving time, and the restoring time
of a snapshot.
Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the contents of Word [5] and
Excel exercises, and the operations described are included in
the Microsoft Office Specialist Study Guide [6][7]. From
these results, we confirmed that snapshots can be saved and
restored in as long as 10 seconds.
Although
it
depends
on
the
work
content,
when
performing the exercise during basic experimental class
without using our system, it was necessary for the instructor
to wait about 15 minutes for the students to re-do an exercise.
The instructor was able to restore the previous state even in
one
minute
by
using
our
system.

B. Review
Here are some of the comments from instructors:
1)
Mr. Murayama (Information Technology):

I think that it can be used at the time of class that
students need to accumulate basic knowledge to
advance to the next session.

I would like to use it for debugging and verification
of the system.
2)
Mr. Fujino (Computer science):

This tool will bring a lot of benefit to my computer
science courses, such as operating systems and
databases.

Considering the situation of exercise, it will very
convenient for students when they make mistakes in
exercises if they can reset the states of the computer.
We got a favorable impression from instructors.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In a conventional computer class environment, it is
difficult for students to learn how to repeat an operation
demonstrated by an instructor as the instructor has time
constraints and must wait for each student to complete the
operation.
In this paper, we introduce the possibility of a new
classroom
approach
by
using
computer
virtualization
technology, and thereby demonstrated the performance of
this system.
In the future, we are planning to confirm the system's
effectiveness by using it in other instructional classes.
