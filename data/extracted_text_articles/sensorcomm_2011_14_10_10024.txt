Abstract—In this work, the condition of a metallic structure
is classiﬁed based on the acquired sensor data from a surface-
mounted piezoelectric sensor/actuator network. The structure
under consideration is an aluminum plate with riveted holes
and possible crack damage in these holes is investigated. The
sensor/actuator network uses diagnostic signals injected to
piezoelectric actuators and received sensor signals to detect the
crack. The damage classiﬁcation system consists of three major
components: sensitive signal acquisition, principal feature ex-
traction and damage classiﬁcation. An appropriate sine wave
burst is used as diagnostic signals for actuators to transmit
to sensors in order to detect the integrity of the structure.
The combination of time-domain S0 waves from all sensitive
sensor signals is directly used as features to detect damage.
Since the time sequence of the extracted S0 waves is selected
as the feature and has a high dimension, principal component
estimation is applied to reduce the data dimension before
entering the neural network training. Finally, in structure
condition classiﬁcation, a LVQ (learning vector quantization)
neural network is used to classify structure conditions as
healthy or damaged. In this paper, a number of FEM (ﬁnite
element modeling) simulation results of sensor signals are
taken as inputs to the neural network for training, since it
is found that the FEM results have a good agreement with the
experimental testing results on real plates. The performance of
the classiﬁcation is then validated by using these testing results.

I. INTRODUCTION
Early detection of damages such as cracks in metallic
structures due to cyclic loads and environmental corrosion is
critical for preventing catastrophic failure and prolonging the
life of aircraft structures. To reduce the cost of maintenance,
structural health monitoring (SHM) has been proposed as an
alternative approach to replace traditional time-consuming
inspection for maintenance. The wave propagation method
for structural health monitoring has been demonstrated to be
effective in detecting debonding in composites and cracks in
metallic structures. Therefore, in this work, wave propaga-
tion method based on surface-mounted piezoelectric sensor
arrays is adopted to monitor crack growth at riveted holes.
In general, the structural health monitoring system con-
sists of two major parts: hardware and software. The
hardware includes the distributed sensor network and the
data acquisition system. In this work, the active sensing
network with actuators excited by known diagnosis signals is
adopted. And the software part for diagnosis includes signal
analysis for sensitive feature extraction and intelligent al-
gorithms for damage interpretation and classiﬁcation, which
actually result in the physical condition of a given structure
from the raw sensor measurements. Our research reported in
this paper is concentrated on feature extraction and structure
condition classiﬁcation.
Neural network methods are widely used to solve clas-
siﬁcation problem, since when properly trained they eas-
ily map the extracted feature space to structure condition
space. Designing an effective neural network has always
been a challenging task. In [6], a three-layer propabilistic
neural network is applied to classify the sensor data into
several categories relative to the damage location in the
circular plates using resonance frequency shifts of E/M
(electro/mechanical) impedance as damage features. In [7],
a backpropagation neural network is trained to categorize
cracks according to their lengths using FE modeling data for
scattering of ultrasound by the cracks emanating from rivet
holes in a thin aluminum plate. An impedance-based damage
detection combined with a backpropagarion neural network
is developed in [8] to locate and identify the structure
damages. In [9], with independent component analysis for
vibration features, a multi-layer perceptron neural network,
trained using an error backpropagation algorithm, is able to
detect the undamaged and damaged states with very good
accuracy and repeatability.
Lamb wave is much more sensitive to structure dam-
ages than other structural responses such as modal shape,
natural frequency, etc., and the artiﬁcial neural network
technique based on Lamb wave testing is able to lead to
precise identiﬁcation of the damages. In [10], the authors
developed an identiﬁcation technique for debonding in ad-

hesively bonded joints using Lamb wave signals interpreted
by neural network training. In [11], different crack lengths
at four locations in a PVC sandwich panel were numerically
simulated and the percentage shifts in structural energy
were used to train a backpropagation neural network. Good
identiﬁcation precision was achieved for another numerically
simulated damage cases, while poor precision was attained
using measurement signals. In [12], the so-called DDFs
(digital damage ﬁngerprints) are extracted from the spec-
trographic characteristics of Lamb wave signals and serve
as damage features. Various numerical simulation results
are employed to train the NN (neural network) and then
experimentally validated by identifying cylinder through-
holes and delamination in the composite laminates. In most
of these papers, the artiﬁcial NN employs the method of
supervised feedforward backpropagation.
This paper presents a method based on neural network
for the classiﬁcation of an aluminum plate with and without
crack damage at reveted holes. The time-domain sensor
signals are directly used as damage features, and key fea-
tures having reduced data size are extracted after principal
component estimation. The estimated key features are then
considered as the input at the neural network, which is
trained according to the learning vector quantization method.
The NN training uses FEM (ﬁnite element modeling) data of
Lamb wave propagation in the active sensor network system,
and the classiﬁcation performance is evaluated through the
validation using the experimental testing data.
II. ACTIVE SENSING SYSTEM FOR STRUCTURE CRACK
DETECTION
Figure 1.
Active sensing system for an aluminum plate with riveted holes
with cracks.
The aluminum plate with riveted holes illustrated in Fig. 1
is studied on crack detection using the active sensing system,
which consists of sensors denoted as s1, s2, · · ·, s7, and
actuators denoted as a1, a2, · · ·, a7. The cracks in the hole
are indicated in Fig. 1 with length l. The actuators excited by
the diagnosis signal, which is here the windowed sinewave
burst as shown in Fig. 2, transmit the signal to the sensors.
The received signal on the sensor contains the information
about the integrity of the structure between the actuator and
the sensor, and will be used to detect any crack occurrence
by investigating any change in the received signal. Based
on the analysis of the sensor signals, information can be
retrieved concerning the extent of the damage and used to
assess and classify the health condition of the structure.
In this work, we take actuator a4 as one case which is
excited by the diagnosis signal in Fig. 2. Signal propagation
is simulated with FEM method, and will be veriﬁed by
testing on real plates.

A. FEM simulation
The FEM result of sensor signals for the pristine plate
is shown in Fig. 3. The fundamental symmetric (S0) mode
is widely used to detect surface crack in metallic structures
due to its sensitivity to crack growth [1] and thus in this
work it is utilized for crack detection. As indicated in Fig.
3, S0 wave is obviously fetched by the sensors.
When the plate has a crack with l=6mm at the hole #4,
the signals of sensors 1 to 4 are shown in Fig. 12. It is
obviously noticed that the S0 wave amplitude of sensor 4
is reduced compared with that of the pristine plate. In this
case, because sensors s5, s6 and s7 are symmetric to sensors
s3, s2 and s1, their signals are respectively the same as those
of sensors s3, s2 and s1 and thus omitted here.
With different crack lengths, the maximum amplitude of
S0 wave of each sensor signal is plotted in Fig. 5. As
expected, sensor s4 is most sensitive to crack at hole #4,
which is proved from Fig. 5 as the curve corresponding to
s4 drops most signiﬁcantly even for a small crack l=2mm.

Other sensors s2 and s3 are sensitive to bigger cracks, while
s1 signal does not change much and thus it is not able to
detect the crack at hole #4.
Simulation results of sensor signals for cracks located
respectively at holes # 3, 2 and 1 have been obtained. The
S0 wave maximum amplitude versus different crack lengths
is displayed in Fig.s 6-8. In Fig. 6, s3 and s2 are most
sensitive to cracks, and s1 is also possibly useful to detect
crack. In Fig. 7 for the crack at hole #2, s1 and s2 are
able to detect it. However, for crack at hole #1, none of the
four sensors is capable of detecting the crack. This implies
that excitation to an actuator closer to it is required. In this
work, we study the case of actuator a4 excited. As for other
actuators, the processing to sensor signals is similar.

B. Experimental veriﬁcation
The experimental setup consists of an Arbitrary Wave
Generator (AWG) 2041, PZT driver, sensor signal ampli-
ﬁers, and a programmable GAGE Compuscope 82G card
connected to a PC running Labwindows/CVI. The actuation
and the sensor signals are ampliﬁed by high bandwidth
ampliﬁers. The data acquisition subsystem includes a PCI
interface controlled with the PC running Labwindows/CVI,
and the data are saved in PC through the GAGE card. The
schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 10.
Figure 10.
Experimental setup.
Experimental testing on a real plate has been conducted.
Circular transducers as sensors and actuators are mounted to
the surface of the plate by using epoxy. Excitation signal to
the actuator is the same as that in Fig. 2. The sensor signal is
collected via the data acquisition card with 20MHz sampling
rate. For the pristine plate, sensor signals are displayed in
Fig. 11, which agrees well with the simulation results in Fig.
3. We take the plate with crack l=6mm at hole#4 as one
example with crack. Fig.s 12-13 show the simulation and
experimental results, where it is observed that the S0 mode
agrees quite well to each other.

involved in the methodology are 1) S0 wave extraction, 2)
Estimation of principal components, 3) Structure condition
classiﬁcation using a neural network.
The proposed approach makes use of an architecture that
consists of a neural network to classify different structure
conditions. The scheme employed in the approach is shown
in Fig. 14, and is detailed in subsequent sections and outlined
below.
Figure 14.
Classiﬁcation architecture.
The ﬁrst step of the methodology involves the extraction
of S0 wave. The time sequences of S0 waves from several
sensors are used as inputs to the stage of principal com-
ponent estimation. This step directly uses the time-domain
signal of the sensors, which reduces the processing time for
the sensor signals.
The second step given in the proposed approach involves
the dimension reduction of the sensor signal using Principal
Component Estimation. Principal component analysis (PCA)
is a statistical technique used for data compression by
determining a linear transformation matrix W ∈ Rm×n
(m < n). The data X ∈ Rn×1 is compressed and a lower
dimension data y ∈ Rm×1 is yielded and given by
y = WX.
(1)
The PCA technique is to reduce the number of features
representing a data by discarding the ones which have small
variance and retains only those that have large variance. It
uses singular value decomposition method in calculating the
eigenvectors of the co-variance matrix formed by analyzing
the sensor data. Only those eigenvectors are selected which
give the maximum information about the data. These chosen
eigenvectors form the matrix W.
The last and the main step of classifying structure condi-
tions are obtained from the methodology of neural network.
The neural network is based on Learning Vector Quantiza-
tion (LVQ) nets. The LVQ network is trained using Kohonen
learning rule to classify structure conditions.
IV. CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The time domain data of S0 waves from sensors 1 to 4
discussed in Section II is used as feature to classify the cases
into categories relative to the structure condition. In this
paper, two classes are assigned: 1 representing no damage,
and 2 representing damage with crack.
As shown in Table 1, the shaded parts are the types of
plates under investigation. It is shown that the data used for
principal component estimation and neural network training
are mostly coming from FEM results. Only one case is
from a real specimen as the pristine plate. For principal
component estimation and neural network training, these
data are expanded as 1019 pristine plate and 736 damaged
plates, which means the sensor data for pristine plate is
repeatedly used for 1019 times, and the sensor data for each
damaged case is repeatedly used for 46 times. The dimension
of S0 wave combination from the four sensors is 1684. After
principal component estimation, the dimension is reduced
from 1684 to 13.
The used LVQ neural network (’newlvq’ function in Mat-
lab) is a a two-layer network. The ﬁrst layer is a competitive
layer that uses the compet transfer function and calculates
the distance from an input to each row of the input weight
matrix. The second layer is a linear layer having purelin
neurons. In this application, the number of hidden neuron
369

of the ﬁrst layer is 4 and the class percentages are 45% and
55%.
As shown in Table 1, testing results from 10 real plates
(indicated by the shadow) are used to verify the classiﬁca-
tion method. Based on the trained LVQ neural network, 8
plates are classiﬁed correctly, and 2 plates are not classiﬁed
correctly. It is noted the NN training is mainly based on
the FEM simulation results. The trained NN leads to such a
classiﬁcation results for the tested specimens is acceptable
and promising. It is also noticed that the trained NN is
potentially able to identify combined cracks, although it is
solely based on the single crack cases.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the aluminum plates with the riveted holes
and possible crack damage at these holes have been studied
and the surface-mounted piezoelectric sensor/actuator net-
work has been utilized to detect the crack. The 400 kHz
sine wave burst has been used as diagnostic signals and
injected to actuators and it propagates to sensors in order
to detect the integrity of the structure. The combination of
time-domain S0 waves from all sensitive sensor signals has
been directly used as features to detect the crack damage.
After the principal component estimation, the reduced-size
data work as input for the LVQ neural network training.
The neural network training has utilized a series of FEM
simulation results, since it has been found that the FEM
results have a good agreement with the experimental testing
results on real plates. The performance of the classiﬁcation
has been ﬁnally validated by using the testing results from
10 real plates.
