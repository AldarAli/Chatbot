Abstract—Catheters are thin tubes or wires made of medical-
grade materials that are inserted through small incisions into
the human body. In order to have a safe and effective robot-
assisted radio frequency ablation, a real-time force estimator is
required to measure the applied forces at the tip of the catheter.
Finite element analysis can provide the real-time contact force
of the steerable catheter. To do so, a nonlinear planar finite
element model of the steerable catheter was first developed using
parametric material properties in ANSYS software. After that,
a series of finite element simulations based on each mechanical
property was performed, and the deformed shape of the catheter
was recorded. Next, the performance was validated by comparing
the outputs of the simulation with experimental results from
setup. In fact, the validation force was between the range 0
and 0.45 N that determined the material properties of the
catheter. The results of the proposed finite element model were in
fair agreement with reference values from the experiment. The
proposed method met the requirements for autonomous cardiac
ablation in terms of accuracy and speed.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the elderly population, Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is the
most common arrhythmia, in which the electrical activity
within the atria becomes chaotic [1]. Consequently, chaotic
contractions of the atrium may result in blood clots and
strokes [2]. As a treatment, in Radio Frequency Ablation
(RFA), the arrhythmogenic sites within the cardiac tissue are
partially burned off to reduce the undesired pulsation within
the cardiac tissue. Catheters are thin tubes made of medical-
grade materials that are inserted through small incisions into
the body. The majority of atrial ablation procedures are carried
out using manual catheters; however, robotic catheter inter-
vention systems have been introduced to enable more precise
mapping and ablation procedures [3][4]. It has been shown
that excessive contact force (greater than 0.45 N) increases
the incidence of tissue perforation, while inadequate force
(less than 0.1 N) results in ineffective ablation. Figure 1
shows a scheme of a cardiac steerable RFA catheter used for
AFib treatment. For RFA catheters, researchers have proposed

sensor-based [5][6], and model-based [3] shape estimation
schemes [7]. Even though sensor-based studies have shown
favorable accuracy [8][9][10], sensor-embedded catheters are
limited by their size, weight, compromised flexibility, and
high cost [11]. In the literature, sensor-free approaches for
estimating force have been proposed based on shape sensing
[12]. Typically, these methods use real-time images of a
deflected catheter to determine tip contact forces based on
a mechanistic model of the catheter. Among the mechanistic
methods to model the catheter is the Pseudo-Rigid-Body
(PRB) model, which showed low accuracy [13][14] to be used
in the medical applications. Also, the other models such as
interaction modeling [15], piecewise circular arcs [16], spatial
curves [17], Kirchhoff models [18], and Cosserat rod models
[19][20], are not suitable for estimating the shape of the
catheter in real-time because they are mainly computationally
expensive. On the other hand, learning-based methods have
been proposed to estimate the contact forces directly from the
images containing the deflection shapes of the distal shaft [21]
[22]. However, such approaches are in need to be fed by the
realistic data obtained from experimental setups. Compiling
a dataset that comprises all possible deflections with respect

to the eclectic catheter’s material is costly and cumbersome.
The scientific achievement of this study is the development of
a real-time force estimator for robot-assisted radio frequency
ablation using finite element analysis.
Given the reviewed limitations, this study proposes a para-
metric Finite Element Model (FEM) to simulate the deforma-
tion of a steerable catheter and estimate the tip contact force.
The main contribution of this study is to propose a shape-based
force estimation according to the finite element simulation.
Due to the availability of real-time X-ray images during RFA
procedures (fluoroscopy), the shape of the RFA catheter is
available intraoperatively. Given such a capability, the pro-
posed simulation can pave the way for leveraging the deep
learning potentiality in finding the relationship between the
parameters and their corresponding bending shape. This will
obviate the run-time issue in the simulation-based approaches.
Having a precise shape of the catheter along with the generated
contact force outputted by the proposed simulation, it will also
be possible to estimate the contact forces using the proposed
method by matching the authentic catheter’s deflection to the
simulation output. Section II describes the finite element model
used in this study. In Section III, validation of the simulation
using the experimental setup will be presented and the results
of the model are shown in Section IV. Finlay, the main
contributions of this study will be concluded in Section V.
II. FINITE ELEMENT SIMULATION
In this study, the catheter is modeled as a cantilever beam
with a length of L = 108 mm and diameter D = 2.33 mm
(this size is equivalent to the French size 7). These are the
dimensions of the available catheter (Blazer II XP, Model
4770THK2, total length 110 cm, Boston Scientific [23]). Only
the distal segment of the catheter was imported into the simu-
lation. Figure 2 shows the cross-section of the proximal section
and distal segment of the catheter. Since different materials are
used to prototype the catheter (e.g., kevlar wrap and steering
plate), the equivalent Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and
density are considered as parameters in the finite element
simulations of the catheter. Then based on the deformation of
the catheter during the experimental setup, the values for these
parameters are tuned. During the simulation, the catheter’s tip
was squeezed on a rigid surface (e.g., the lumens or cardiac
tissues) for 40 mm, and the reaction force at the base was
recorded. Figure 3 shows the FE homogeneous Dirichlet and

Neumann boundary conditions which were applied at the right-
most of the model to simulate the cantilever condition for the
distal shaft of the catheter. The model was discretized and
solved using 108 elements and the nonlinear geometry (large
deformation) assumption using ANSYS software (ANSYS
Inc., PA, USA). Figure 4 shows the representative deformed
shape of the catheter under 40 mm tip displacement. Next
section will provide more details of the simulations validation.
III. VALIDATION STUDY
To validate the parametric simulation and find the material
properties, a range for every three parameters is considered
as follows: Young’s modulus ranges from 120 to 200 MPa,
Poisson’s ratio from 0.3 to 0.4, and density from 7000 to
8000 kg/m3. The range specifies the minimum and maximum
of each parameter during the simulation. Table I shows the
experimental points for the range of each parameter and the
corresponding reaction force.

The experimental setup in Figure 5 mimics the catheter
simulation. Prior to the experiment, 108 mm length of the
catheter tip was measured and fixed in the holder of the linear
actuator. The linear actuator was rapidly prototyped using a
3D printer (Replicator+, MakerBot, NY, USA) so as to align
the center of the holder and 6-DoF force/torque sensor (ATI
Industrial Automation, F/T Sensor: Mini40) (Figure 5 (4))
[24]. The purpose of the 6-DoF force/torque sensor is to
measure the force applied to the clamped base by the tip
of the catheter. Next, a Nema 17 stepper motor (Figure 5
(8)) controlled by an Arduino MEGA 2560 (Figure 5 (11))
squeezed the catheter tip against the force sensor mounted
at the end of the linear actuator. It is the purpose of the
stepper motor to drive the linear actuator. Simultaneously, a
camera (Figure 5 (3)) perpendicular to the deflection plane
was used to record the deflection of the catheter. During the
experiment, the catheter tip’s bending angle was set to 0◦ by
using the catheter’s knob, and also the initial shape of the
catheter was straight. The wiring of the stepper motor in Figure
5 (8) is connected microstep driver Figure 5 (12). Figure 6
compares the result of the experiment and simulation when
the tip of the catheter was squeezed for 40 mm. Utilizing
ANSYS’s response surface optimization (RSO) module, the
candidate point is selected with the aim of minimizing the error
between the reaction force obtained from the force sensor and
the simulation. Figure 7 shows the recorded force during the
experiment. Next section provides the result and discussion of
the study.

Figure 8 shows the variation of reaction force by changing
the density in the range of 7000 to 8000 (kg/m3) while
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio are set to 137.6 MPa
and 0.394, respectively. Similarly, Figure 9 and Figure 10
show the variation of reaction force by changing the Young’s
modulus and Poisson ratio while other parameters are set to
the candidate values. The Figures showed the sensitivity of the
reaction force to the Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio.
As illustrated in Figures 8 and 10, the reaction force is
slightly changed by the variation of the density and Poisson’s
ratio. However, as shown in Figure 9 the reaction force
is highly dependent on the value of Young’s modulus. In
addition, igures 11 to 13 provide a 3D plot of the variation
in reaction force at the selected candidate points. The results
showed that the reaction force increased by incensing Young’s
modulus and density. The reason for this is that the capability

of transferring force is directly related to the material property,
and that by increasing the material property and having a
stiffer material, more force can be transferred. However, by
increasing the Poisson’s ratio, the reaction force decreased.
Moreover, as the catheter’s tip weight is small, density almost
has no impact on the reaction force, proving the validity of
the quasi-statistics assumption in the FEM modeling and in
the applications that the velocity of deformation is slow.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A real-time force estimator is necessary for ensuring the
safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted radio frequency ab-
lation. The purpose of this study was to simulate a parametric
finite element model for a steerable catheter which will be used
for the estimation of force during radio frequency ablation
procedures. A setup experiment is conducted to determine the
design parameters of the catheter by comparing the deforma-
tion of the catheter between the experiment (by capturing the
deformation of the catheter) and the finite element simulations.
The results of the FE simulation were in fair agreement with
the reference values obtained from the experiment. Based
on the outcome of the current study, the proposed method
was able to meet both the accuracy and speed requirements
for procedures involving robot-assisted autonomous cardiac
ablation. In terms of simulation speed, the time required
for the ablation process to be completed can be measured
and compared against a desired time frame or benchmark.
For future work, a learning-from-simulation model will be
proposed to estimate the tip contact force without actually
running the simulation in real-time. This feature will enhance
the accuracy and precision of minimally invasive procedures
for robotic catheter intervention systems.
