Abstract—The response of calcifying marine organisms, 
especially from corals – arguably among the most 
biologically 
diverse 
and 
ecologically 
important 
ecosystems on the planet – could have a potential 
mitigating role in buffering atmospheric CO2. Here we 
report that the organic substances that participate in 
biocalcification in coral skeletons contain a carbonic 
anhydrase (CA) enzyme which is a biological catalyst 
responsible for the interconversion of CO2 and 
bicarbonate. 
Also, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
internal 
physiological condition of the body of corals has 
precisely evolved to respond to external environmental 
conditions. We find that the CA in the organic matrix 
acts as “keys” to control those internal conditions to 
enable a response to external environmental change. 
This study of biocalcification process can be used as a 
tool for understanding coral mineralization in nature 
and global climate change, and also has implications for 
CO2 capture from the atmosphere.

anhydrase ; climate change; organic matrix

 INTRODUCTION  
  Calcifying marine organisms make extensive use of 
calcium carbonate (CaCO3), one of the most abundant 
minerals in nature, as a structural or protective material. 
Biologically formed calcium carbonates are mainly calcite, 
aragonite and vaterite as well as high Mg-calcites. During the 
work on biocalcification, it is seen that morphology, 
mineralogy and chemistry of biologically formed calcium 
carbonate are largely dependent on both biological species 
and physical-chemical environmental conditions. Proteins 
and enzymes may act as “keys” to control internal conditions 
and respond to external environmental change.   
Identification and elucidation of proteins and their enzyme 
activity involved in calcium carbonate skeleton or spicules 
formation in corals are very important to understand the 
calcification process, biodiversity of their ecosystems and 
carbon cycling, along with global environmental change. 
Atmospheric CO2 is expected to reach double the 
preindustrial levels by the year 2065. It is believed that the 
increase in CO2 concentration is responsible for global 
warming. Biological sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
in geological formations is one of the proposed methods to 
reduce the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. 
Mineralization of CO2 can be achieved by direct contact of 
gaseous CO2 with mineral sources of calcium or magnesium 
or by dissolving CO2 in water and then bringing the solution 
into contact with the minerals. Either way will produce 
calcium or magnesium carbonate, which are solids and will 
precipitate [1, 2].  In the present work, the feasibility of 
using CA enzyme as a catalyst for hydration of CO2, as well 
as its precipitation in the form of calcium carbonate, was 
studied. The effects of enzyme concentration and 
temperature on the hydration of CO2 and formation of 
calcium carbonate were investigated. Here we applied CA 
enzyme extracted from the soft coral sclerites, Sinularia 
polydactyla as a model. The information gained from this 
study 
would 
be 
applicable 
in 
understanding 
the 
biomineralization process of corals and their response to 
global climate change. 
 
II.     MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A.   Sample preparation  
     Sclerites were separated from the coral colony (Sinularia 
polydactyla) according to the mechanical and chemical 
treatments followed by Rahman et al., 2006 [3]. Briefly, the 
collected sclerites were stirred vigorously in 1M NaOH for 
2 hours and subsequently in 1% NaClO solution for 2 hours 
to remove the fleshy tissues and debris. Treated samples 
were washed under tap water until the sclerites were 
completely cleaned. Finally, samples were washed with 
distilled water (five times) to remove unwanted substances. 
 
B.  CA assay 
     To examine the CA activity, the chemically treated 
sclerites were decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 7.8) overnight, 
followed by dialysis against H2O for 48 hours. Proteins 
were separated from the soluble organic matrix of sclerites 
using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to 
the method of Laemmli [4]. After electrophoresis, the bands 
of interest were excised from the SDS-PAGE and the pure 
proteins were extracted by electro-elution treatment, using

the Electro-eluter (Model 422, Bio-Rad) according to the 
procedure of Rahman et al., [5]. The Micron centrifugal 
Filter Devices (Millipore) were used for further purification 
of the sample.  
    The amount of protein concentration in each fraction was 
measured by the method of Lowry et al. [6] using chicken 
ovalbumin (Kanto chemical) as a standard protein followed 
by a spectrophotometric assay of protein. We measured CA 
activity using the CO2-Veronal indicator method [7] as 
follows. Six drops of phenol red, 3 ml of 20mM Veronal 
buffer (Sodium 5, 5-Diethylbarbiturate, pH 8.3), and 0 .5 ml 
of a sample were mixed and placed in ice water; then the 
reaction was started by adding 2 ml of ice-cold water 
saturated with CO2 followed by observation of the time until 
the color changed from red to yellow for a pH drop to 7.3. 
The EU was calculated according to the following equation. 
Activity unit (EU) = (To – T)/ T 
[where T and To are the reaction times required for the pH 
change from 8.3 to 7.3 at 0oC with and without a catalyst, 
respectively].  
C. Enzymatic Hydration of CO2. Carbonic anhydrase 
catalyzes the hydration reaction of CO2, and consequently, 
hydrogen ions are transferred between the active site of the 
enzyme. This results in a change in pH. Therefore, 
measuring pH via the delta pH method is a viable method to 
monitor the progress of this enzymatic reaction [8]  
D.   Enzymatic Precipitation of Calcium Carbonate.   
     The influence of CA enzyme on the precipitation of CO2 
in the form of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was studied 
according to Mirjafari et al [9] and Rahman et al. [10]  
 
III.      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
A.   Biocalcification  
     For understanding biocalcification process in corals and 
their response to climate change, we purified proteins and 
enzyme from a soft coral sclerites, S. polydactyla. The SDS-
PAGE analysis of the preparation showed seven proteins 
with the apparent molecular masses of 109, 83, 70, 63, 41, 
30 and 22 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 2) that we named SP-1 
(Sinularia polydactyla-1), SP-2, SP-3, SP-4, SP-5, SP-6 and 
SP-7 respectively. In the present work, we purified a protein 
with a molecular mass of about 83-kDa  (SP-2) (Fig. 1, lane 
2), which has high CA activity (Fig. 2). We excised the 
protein bands from the SDS-PAGE and extracted the 
purified proteins by electro-elution treatment. We confirmed 
the CA protein (SP-2) followed by the technique as 
indicated above (Fig. 2).  
In order to identify CA activity associated with the purified 
proteins, the samples were assayed independently. Fig. 3 
shows that the SP-2 possessed specific CA activity; where 
other has lower activity. The CA activity of both the matrix 
protein (SP-2) and bovine erythrocyte enzyme (BECA) was 
inactivated by heat treatment at 100oC for 10 min, which 
showed no activity. Since SP-2 showed the highest and most 
significant activity among the seven proteins, we can 
consider only SP-2 to be a CA domain protein in S. 
Polydactyla.  
    Internal and external reactions of coral body including 
hard 
endoskeleton 
of 
sclerites 
are 
occurred 
with 
biocalcification process. In the mineralization of CO2, 
calcium carbonate is produced through a reaction between 
calcium ions and aqueous CO2. The following reactions take 
place in this process:  
(1) First, gaseous CO2 dissolves in water to form aqueous 
CO2.    
         CO2(g) ↔  CO2                                      (1)   
(2) Then, aqueous CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic 
acid:  
         CO2(aq) + H20 ↔ H2CO3                      (2)  
 
(3) In the next step, carbonic acid dissociates to bicarbonate 
and carbonate ions in the presence of CA enzyme: 
 
        H2CO3 ↔ H+  +  HCO3
-                       (3)  
 
        HCO3
-   ↔ H+  +  CO3
2-                        (4) 
 
Reaction 3 is very rapid and is virtually diffusion controlled.  
(4) At the end, in the presence of calcium cations, calcium 
carbonate forms and precipitates:  
 
            Ca2+   +    CO3
2-  →  CaCO3↓              (5) 
 
Among reactions 1−5, reaction 2 is the slowest, and it is the 
rate-limiting step. It is proposed that a biological catalyst be 
used to increase the rate of this reaction.[11-13]. The 
biological catalyst for this reaction is enzyme carbonic 
anhydrase.  
B.  Enzymatic Precipitation of Calcium Carbonate  
     The amount of CaCO3 decreased as the temperature 
increased. The weight of CaCO3 at 0, 30, and 50 °C was 
0.2097, 0.1282, and 0.095 g, respectively. This is because 
the solubility of CO2 in water decreases with increasing 
temperature [14]. This result did not depend on the 
temperature or concentration of the enzyme. When the 
buffer is absent from the reaction mixture, addition of CO2 
to the mixture drives the pH down to low values (near 4). 
The 
chemistry 
of 
CO2 
hydration and bicarbonate 
dissociation shows that, in low pH, there is not enough 
carbonate ion present [15]. As a result, the solution does not 
become saturated with CaCO3. This is the reason 
precipitation was not observed in this condition.  
     In the absence of the enzyme, precipitation was observed 
after 2 h. The amount of CaCO3 was almost the same as its 
amount in the presence of the enzyme (Table 1). However, 
Figure 3 indicates that precipitation of calcium carbonate 
was much faster in the presence of CA enzyme. This figure

presents a comparison of the precipitation in the presence 
and absence of the enzyme. It is clearly seen that, in the 
presence of the enzyme, CaCO3 reached its maximum value 
in less than 10 min; however, when no enzyme was added to 
the reaction mixture, the formation of calcium carbonate 
took place very slowly.  
     Carbonic anhydrases are very well-known enzymes that 
are ubiquitous in nature. They can be found in animals and 
plants and even in the human erythrocyte. They exist in 
different forms, with different structures and molecular 
weights, and their activities vary from one to another. They 
are among the fastest enzymes known. For instance, each 
molecule of isozyme C from the human body can catalyze 
1.4 × 106 molecules of CO2 in 1 s [16].  
     In the presence of an anhydrase enzyme, the mechanism 
of hydration of CO2 changes completely. The evidence 
suggests that the catalysis of CO2 hydration is initiated by 
the nucleophilic attack on the carbon atom of CO2, by zinc-
bound OH-, to produce bicarbonate, which is then displaced 
from zinc by a water molecule [17].  In this study, the 
Mineralization of carbon dioxide is investigated as a method 
of converting CO2 to mineral carbonates. The slow rate of 
hydration of CO2 has been a limiting factor to make this 
method widely accepted. Carbonic anhydrase enzyme 
isolated from soft corals sclerites has been shown to be 
credible 
as 
biological 
catalysts 
to 
overcome 
this 
shortcoming. The results showed that this enzyme was a 
very effective catalyst for coral mineralization. Overall, it 
promoted the hydration of CO2 and, consequently, the 
precipitation of CaCO3.
