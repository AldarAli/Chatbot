Abstract— Static geosensor networks equipped with variety of 
sensors are used for collecting and transmitting physical data 
from their surrounding environment. These geosensor networks 
are used for monitoring potential disaster areas for early 
warning systems. Weather stations are an example of such static 
geosensor networks used for the collection of meteorological 
data, as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind direction and 
speed, used, for example, as input data for forest fire prediction 
and behavior systems. Nevertheless, static geosensor networks 
show some limitations, in terms of insufficient coverage, low 
density, nondynamical, limited power source and budget 
constraints. In recent years, the use of crowdsourced 
Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has emerged as a 
working methodology for retrieving real-time data in disaster 
areas; thus, allowing real-time and continuous aggregation of 
data and production of information. Using VGI methodologies, 
having the capacity of collecting dynamic real-time data can 
reduce deficiencies related to the use of static geosensor 
networks. This study is aimed at proving the feasibility of using 
VGI data as a reliable data source for reducing weather 
geosensor network limitations along with estimating the 
reliability and accuracy of crowdsourced data. This is done by 
analyzing the observations made by smartphones to prove their 
capacity. An example is presented to emphasize the potential of 
using crowdsourced VGI to densify and enhance static 
geosensor networks.

 INTRODUCTION 
Forest fires are vital natural phenomenon that maintains 
the health of ecosystems in reproducing, renewing and 
extending the diversity of species. Still, forest fires can also be 
a destructive natural disaster having devastating impact on the 
ecological, biological and social environment. Fast detection 
of fire and short arrival time of the fire brigades are key 
elements that can make the difference between small-scale 
disaster and mass casualty incident. Knowing in real-time 
crucial physical components that affect the spread and extent 
of forest fires enable the emergency agencies to act faster, and 
to be better prepared in case of forest fires. Because of the 
necessity for receiving - in real time - data from the area, early 
warning systems were developed. 
A. Geoseneor Networks for Early Warning Systems 
Early warning systems for disaster situations are usually 
based on static geosensor networks that monitor a 
predetermined stationary area for providing hazardous 
warning in cases of fires, floods, earthquakes and more. These 
geosensor networks are comprised of physical sensors aimed 
at warning of potential risk for disaster occurrence. Those 
sensors collect physical data from their environment and have 
the ability of transmitting it. Nevertheless, static geosensor 
networks show some limitations, in terms of insufficient 
coverage, low density, nondynamical, limited power source 
and budget constraints.   
 By using crowdsourced VGI working methodology, i.e., 
collecting data from volunteers in the area, limitations related 
to the use of static geosensor network can be reduced. For 
example, coverage and density of the network can be 
expanded using real-time user generated observations 
(negating the cost limitation), which if required, contribute to 
a more reliable data interpolation for acquiring information 
from unreachable areas. Moreover, the location of the reports 
varies in time, hence making the network dynamic and 
flexible. In addition, disabled sensors (e.g., damaged, blinded, 
or without power source) can be replaced with real-time data 
generated voluntarily by nearby citizens. 
B. VGI for Disaster Situations 
In recent years, the use of Volunteered Geographic 
Information (VGI) has emerged as a working methodology for 
retrieving real-time data in disaster areas. VGI is a subset of 
crowdsourcing paradigm, a working premise in which user-
generated information is gathered and shared by individuals 
who participate voluntarily in a specific task. The reliability 
of information is usually derived by the number of volunteers 
in the area [1][2]. Geo-related crowdsourcing working 
paradigm that combines sensing and communication 
technologies, enables virtually everybody to collect data about 
the immediate environment - with almost no effort and 
expertise; thus, allowing real-time and continuous aggregation 
of data and production of information [2][3]. VGI is an 
effective method for data collection that can be used for 
expanding the variety of data sources and enhancing the 
resolution of sensor readings and reports, thus enriching and 
augmenting information derived from static sensors, 
especially when the nature of the geographic phenomena is 
dynamic [4]. 
In a disaster situation, geospatial data and tools have an 
essential part in many aspects of disaster management 
(planning, 
response, 
recovery 
and 
more).

crowdsourcing tools, geo-tagged data can be collected by 
different means, allowing relief organizations to react better 
in case of emergencies and disasters [5]. It is widely 
acknowledged that real-time geospatial data are an essential 
source of information for all aspects of disaster management 
[6]. 
Generally, relying on user-generated data obtained in real-
time from individuals nearby the interest area can augment the 
knowledge gap that might exist due to lack of accurate and 
updated data that is a result of inadequate sensor network 
deployment. Thus, enabling a more complete understanding 
of the disaster area. As in forest fires monitoring: fusing the 
crowdsourced sensor-data in real-time, and thus densifying 
existing static sensor-networks, have the potential to increase 
the likelihood to derive knowledge in respect to what is 
happening in real-time (i.e., now) – and where exactly. Also, 
to make a reliable and accurate assessment as to what will 
happen next, and consequently - how to respond. 
This research is aimed toward improving and augmenting 
geosensor network deficiencies by using crowdsourced VG 
data. This paper presents preliminary examination of this 
research paradigm by analyzing meteorological data collected 
solely via smartphones (without the need of additional 
devices). The research is focused on determining the 
reliability and accuracy of the collected data when compared 
to authoritative meteorological geosensor networks. This will 
serve as a preliminary stage towards the feasibility of using 
the crowdsourcing paradigm for such scenarios. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as followed: 
section II reviews related work in the field of VGI, section III 
introduces the methodologies used in this study, section IV 
describes the experiments, followed by analysis and 
evaluation of the results, which are detailed in section V. 
Section VI presents an example of the potential this paradigm 
have, and section VII concludes this paper and presents future 
work.

RELATED WORK 
Recent studies have proved that the public is collaborating 
in sharing and collecting information [7][8][9]. Furthermore, 
in cases of emergencies and disasters, the public's motivation 
for data collection is even bigger [10]. Various different VGI 
based solutions and platforms have emerged for emergency 
and disaster response. Ushahidi, for example, is a 
crowdsourcing platform used for the creation of crisis maps 
on the basis of integrating data from multiple sources and 
devices, as in the Haitian earthquake, Japanese tsunami, 
Kenyan post-election violence crisis [3]. OpenStreetMap 
(OSM) is a platform for creating GI by volunteering 
participants, which edit the map data by uploading GPS 
tracks, interpreting aerial imagery, out-of-copyright maps - 
and more [11]. This enables to use the platform for disaster 
situations characterized by the need for up-to-date maps (used 
in the 2010 Haitian earthquake) [3]. VGI can be used for flood 
damage estimation [12], radiation monitoring [13] or 
environmental sensing. Common Scent is an example of a 
crowdsourced based platform for environmental sensing that 
provides near real-time air quality data based on physical 
sensors mounted on bicycles [14]. Virtually, VGI enables to 
reduce the dependency on experts, while relying on the fact 
that accurate data is collected via diverse sources, 
consequently 
producing 
reliable 
information. 
The 
contribution of VGI for disaster situations is widely 
implemented in various different applications, assisting in 
better managing, controlling and recovering from such events, 
such as fires, earthquakes, violence riots, and also for 
environmental awareness, such as monitoring air quality, 
radiation level and other different hazards [5][15][16]. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
A. Required Data for Forest Fire Model 
The relevant crowdsourced data that is collected for 
fulfilling the objectives of this study can be divided to 
meteorological data and auxiliary data. The meteorological 
data are comprised of: (1) ambient temperature, and (2) 
relative humidity. These are the cardinal input data for fire 
spreading simulators (which generate information regarding 
ongoing fire: perimeter, growth, spreading rate and 
direction), and for fire danger rating systems (used for 
estimating the potential threat of a fire to ignite and spread 
over a large area) [17]. 
Auxiliary data assist in analyzing the reliability of 
meteorological data by describing the environmental 
conditions affecting the collection device. Since here data are 
collected via portable devices, auxiliary data are comprised 
of: (1) illumination – how exposed is the device to direct 
sunlight, (2) proximity - for detecting possible close by 
exterior disturbances, (3) battery properties – in terms of 
heating and current usage, and (4) GPS – acquiring the 
geographic position of the meteorological measurements. The 
readings of the first three give information that is relevant for 
the consistency of metrological data, since they might bias 
them and affect their reliability. 
B. Data Collection Platform 
Since crowdsourcing data collection relies on random 
individuals  situated nearby the interest area, hence most 
probably portable devices will be used that have the 
capability to collect both the meteorological and auxiliary 
data and transmit it in real-time (via the internet). The more 
common and widespread the data collection platform is, the 
probability of citizens participating in gathering data 
increases, therefore enhancing the overall data – and hence 
information - accuracy, density and reliability. After 
examination of possible data collection platforms suitable for 
this purpose, the device that was chosen is the Samsung 
Galaxy S4 (SG4) model GT-I9500 (Samsung having a 
market share of 25% [18]). This model contains sensors 
required for the collection of all the aforementioned data 
types (such that no additional devices are needed). The 
application used for collecting and managing the data is 
'WeatherSignal', which satisfies the collection requirements. 
The SG4 ambient temperature/relative humidity sensor 
model is SHTC1, manufactured by 'Sensirion'. The sensor is

calibrated by the manufacturer for each device it is installed 
in before use in a controlled environment. The official 
accuracy of the sensor is depicted in Table I [19]. 
C. Reference Data 
Analyzing the credibility of the crowdsourced collected 
data, it is necessary to have reliable and accurate sets of 
reference measurements of the same meteorological 
parameters; these will be used for comparison and evaluation 
purposes. For this, data from the Israel Meteorological 
Service (IMS) weather stations, which comply with the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards – also 
in terms of accuracy (depicted in Table II) [20] - are used. 
IV. 
FIELD EXPERIMENTS 
To determine the accuracy of the SG4 ambient 
temperature and relative humidity measurements, data were 
collected in three different scenarios, which differ by the 
collection duration and location (environmental conditions), 
to enable a more qualitative assessment of collected data and 
measuring conditions. 
In the first scenario, the aim was to verify that the 
measurements' accuracy is compatible with the official 
manufacturer accuracy (shown in Table I), and also in non-
laboratory conditions only, i.e., field conditions as well. 
Therefore, data were collected continuously for a long 
duration (about 20 hours), while the SG4 was positioned 
statically nearby an IMS station in a shadowed place to 
eliminate the heating impact of exposure to direct sun light. 
The second scenario was composed of a series of short 
duration measurements: four different times of day for 
approximately 1 hour, and nearby two alternative IMS 
stations. This scenario aims at determining the accuracy of 
the SG4 readings over short periods without having the need 
for data post-processing. 
 The SG4 measurements might be biased due to 
environmental conditions, which affect the measuring 
sensors. Therefore, it is essential to determine when do the 
SG4 readings are accurate without having to rely on external 
reference data. This is determined in the third scenario, which 
is composed from a series of five measuring sessions, where  
in each the SG4 was exposed for a short period to direct 
sunlight, which resulted in erroneous readings. Subsequently, 
the SG4 was moved from the sunlight to a shaded place until 
accurate measurements were obtained in comparison to the 
IMS data (with confidence level of 95%). 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND EVALUATION 
A. First Scenario 
The results of the first scenario are displayed in Table 
III. The ambient temperature mean difference between the 
SG4 and the IMS measurements is 1.1°C, with Standard 
Deviation (SD) of 1.4°C. Assuming the data is normally 
distributed, the estimation interval of the mean with 
probability of 95% is 1.1°C ± 0.2°C. The relative humidity 
mean difference is 6.6%, with SD of 4%. The relative 
humidity confidence interval with probability of 95%, 
assuming the data is normally distributed, is 6.6% ± 0.7%.   
 Possible improvement of the measurements' accuracy 
can be achieved by eliminating outliers, which are caused by 
the surrounding environmental conditions affecting the 
sensor readings. Several outlier detection methods were 
implemented (IQR, boxplots, mean and SD methods). The 
outlier detection methods identified 6 to 9 outliers for the 
ambient temperature measurements, and 1 to 2 outliers for the 
relative humidity measurements; both, out of 134 
observations, such that approximately 95% are considered as 
accurate and reliable. The mean and SD method was chosen 
to be used for eliminating outliers, since it was found to be 
more sensitive to outliers than the other methods. 
 After removing the outliers, the data were analyzed 
again, and the results are presented in Table IV. The ambient 
temperature mean difference was reduced to 0.8°C with SD 
of 0.7°C and confidence level of ±0.1°C. The relative 
humidity measurements were slightly reduced but remained 
of the same scale as prior to the outlier removal since not 
many outliers existed. 
B. Second Scenario  
The ambient temperature mean residual varies from 
minimal value of 0.3°C with SD of 0.1°C and similar 
confidence interval, to maximal value of 1.4°C with SD of  
0.3°C and similar confidence interval, as can be seen in Table  
V. The average of overall mean residuals is 1°C, which is 
similar to the values obtained in the first scenario before the

outlier removal. The relative humidity means residuals range 
from 1% with similar SD and confidence interval of 1%, to 
14% with SD and confidence interval of 1%. 
The mean residuals in 6 out of 8 temperature 
measurements were better or similar to the data obtained in 
the first scenario before removing outliers. In the relative 
humidity measurements, 5 out of 8 mean residuals were 
smaller than the first scenario data after removing outliers. 
According to the analysis results obtained for the two 
different scenarios in controlled conditions, it is clear that the 
SG4 can be used for acquiring accurate and reliable 
meteorological data, even without eliminating outliers, since 
it serves with good quality measures and low bias of 
measurements. 
C. Third Scenario 
The aim of this scenario was to determine the 
environmental conditions in which the SG4 measurements 
are accurate and reliable; this is aimed to allow not to use 
external reference data. Since sensors calibration time 
(needed for obtaining reliable results) are not constant and 
cannot be predetermined, four parameters were defined, 
which 
are 
calculated 
dynamically 
from 
the 
SG4 
measurements, that help determine when the sensor readings 
are stable (not biased) and accurate, hence sensor is 
calibrated: (1) gradient (of data); (2) SD; (3) number of 
observations, and (4) illumination. Using statistical analysis, 
threshold values for the aforementioned parameters were 
determined, depicted in Table VI; based on these parameters 
a calibration algorithm was developed, depicted in Figure 1. 
Implementing the algorithm makes it possible to identify 
when the sensor readings are biased and/or erroneous, while 
correctly detect when readings are reliable - without having 
to use any external reference data. 
Validation of the algorithm is depicted in Figure 2, 
showing a comparison of the IMS temperature data 
(reference) with VGI readings. It can be noted that the 
ambient temperature readings from both data sources are 
similar at the calibration point, characterized in the graph by 
horizontal slope of both indicators (SD and gradient of data), 
that was determined automatically by the algorithm. 
VI. 
POTENTIAL OF VGI FOR REAL-TIME WEATHER DATA 
The potential of using crowdsourcing for the collection of 
weather data is illustrated by the use of the crowdsourced 
weather map created by 'Weather Signal' (WS). WS is an 
application used for voluntarily collecting weather data 
(along with other available sensor data) from sensors 
mounted on portable devices (such as smartphones). The map 
depicted in Figure 3 demonstrates the high density VG data 
have in respect to the static network which is comprised of 
weather stations that are part of the IMS network used by 
KKL-JNF (Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund) 
to monitor meteorological data nearby forests, thus on the 
augmentation potential of using crowdsourced weather data. 
It is clear that the VGI ambient temperature readings are 
filling the gaps in areas having no coverage of weather 
stations, densifying the impact zones, which are sparsely

represented by a single static IMS station. Moreover, it can 
be noticed that using crowdsourced data, areas currently not 
having any IMS station in their vicinity (south, center) now 
have several readings, which greatly contribute to a better 
assessment of physical conditions. 
The crowdsourced weather data, downloaded from WS 
database for a specific date and time (22/3/2014, 13:00-14:00 
GMT+2), were processed using spatial and attributional 
queries for eliminating measurements with incomplete data 
or characterized as indoor, which are irrelevant for this 
analysis. The algorithm used for this process was 
implemented using ArcGIS model-builder. Figure 4 depicts 
Kriging interpolation of the VGI ambient temperature 
readings, with and without existing IMS data for that specific 
date and time. Inspecting the interpolation results, it is clear 
that they are continuous and similar in values - VG data in 
respect to reference data (IMS) with no anomalies detected – 
supporting the fact that VGI measurements are reliable. More 
importantly, as depicted in the lower image, it is clear that 
some physical conditions are revealed and made clear and 
local (mainly in the center) thanks to the data densification – 
a direct result of using VGI. 
VII. 
  CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
The feasibility of collecting reliable and accurate VGI 
metrological observations (ambient temperature and relative 
humidity) via smartphones (SG4 in this case study) was 
verified. Consequently, as presented in the previous section, 
the use of crowdsourced volunteered meteorological 
measurements is made possible, enhancing the input weather 
data collected from the surrounding. Although the accuracy 
of the 'SHTC1' sensor might decrease due to environmental 
conditions, the algorithm developed for this research is 
capable to detect such situations, thus having the possibility 
to filter out erroneous observations. This proves that with 
relatively small post-processing, and without having the need 
to use reference data to analyze the correctness of the data, 
the collection device can function as a reliable and accurate 
'dynamic geosensor station' that serves as supplementary data 
source that is external and independent to the static network. 
Though other devices - other than the SG4 - should be 
analyzed, first inspection made with available WS data 
showed that alternative portable devices are also reliable. 
The next phase of this research will be focused on the 
collection and analysis of crowdsourced VG data from wider 
areas, and on the development of a fusion algorithm designed 
for observations from crowdsourced VGI and IMS. These are 
aimed for densifying the static geosensor network, while the 
output of such process will augment and improve the input 
data required for forest fire models.
