Abstract—Comparison between transport mode classiﬁers is
usually performed without considering imbalanced samples in
the dataset. This problem makes performance rates, such as
accuracy and precision, not enough to report the performance
of a classiﬁer because they represent a cut-off point in the
classiﬁer performance curve. Our rule-based method proposes
to combine both, the network elements associated with the
transport mode to identify, and the elements associated with other
means of transport. We performed a comparison between our
proposed method and another geospatial rule-based method, by
applying a real-world representative dataset with a target class
imbalance. We evaluated the performance of both methods with
ﬁve experiments, using the area under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic curve as metric. The results show that the tested
methods achieve the same false positive rate. However, our
method identiﬁes correctly 84% of the true positive samples,
i.e., the highest performance in our test data (data collected in
Belgium). The proposed method can be used as a part of the
post-processing chain in transport data to perform transport and
trafﬁc analytics in smart cities.

INTRODUCTION
Mobility surveys are carried out around the world with the
purpose of discovering the behavior of citizens according to
the transport mode [1]. Knowing the demand for transport ser-
vices helps cities to manage and improve their transportation
systems. Different strategies, such as questionnaires, interviews
or space-time diaries have been used to collect travel data
in the past. With the advent of smart-phones, that integrate
sensors, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers,
crowdsourcing has come to the scene as a new tool to gather
mobility data, either using a travel diary app or as a background
location-aware service. Hence, automatic public-transport clas-
siﬁcation becomes the key element to capture user’s activity
patterns as well as to perform transport and trafﬁc analytics.
Therefore, the identiﬁcation of public transport modes has
become an active research area [2]. For instance, Transmob
project [3] provided users with mobility cards as a single
payment method to pay bus, tram, subway and train tickets,
parking at garages or streets, and shared bike rentals. M-card10
[4] is a smartphone application of De Lijn, the Flemish bus
agency, in which commuters can buy up to 10 public transport
tickets. The app activates a ticket when getting on a bus or
a tram. These ticket-based systems provide information for
automatic public transport mode detection. However, users
must generate events, check-in and check-out, to identify each
mode accurately. Live positioning systems [5][6] take advan-
tage of the capabilities of Geographical Information Systems
(GIS) to perform transport-mode classiﬁcation on tracking
data collected through cell phones. Such systems require the
integration of tracking data with open access or proprietary
GIS layers for generating geospatial data to discover new
knowledge.
In several studies, GPS data is used because of the temporal
aspects, accurate information about travels and geographical
aspects when it is combined with GIS data, such as Open Street
Map (OSM) transport network [5][7]–[9]. These studies are
aimed to identify transport mode using a rule-based approach.
A common factor among those methods is to use network
elements related to the transport mode for the automatic
transport mode identiﬁcation, e.g., train segments will only
cross railways and train stations. In this paper, we named
these kind of elements as Passing Points (PP). Our approach
for transport mode classiﬁcation also considers trafﬁc network
elements that do not belong to the transport mode to be
identiﬁed. We called these elements Non Passing Points (NPP).
Usually, researchers focus only on reporting the success
rates of their proposed systems. However, when a represen-
tative dataset is used, real case scenarios, this is typically an
unbalanced classiﬁcation problem where it is easy to classify a
sample as non-class to get a high accuracy and precision [10].
Hence, we focus on the true positive rate to report our
outcomes. Our method performs transport mode classiﬁcation
(e.g., train) using the network elements associated with the
transport mode to identify (e.g., train stations and railways),
but we also consider elements associated with other means of
transport (e.g., motorway junctions) to ﬁlter out false positive
trip segments. In this paper, we perform a comparison between
an improved version of our methodology [6] and the work
described by Gong et al. [5]. We evaluated both techniques by
applying them on an extensive labeled dataset collected during
a mobility campaign. Results show that the probability of
falsely rejecting train trips decrease when Non Passing Points
are considered into the method.

the transport network information, and position our approach
related to the state-of-the-art. In Section 3, we describe the
methodology used to compare the tested methods. In Section

methods. Furthermore, in Section 5, we perform experiments

sion at Section 6. The ﬁnal section includes the concluding
remarks.
II.
GPS AND GIS TRANSPORT MODE CLASSIFICATION
Nowadays, mobility survey studies are carried on with GPS
technology. Transport and trafﬁc analytics require that GPS
raw data are post-processed to identify transport modes. Some
studies follow a fuzzy logic approach to carry on this task. The
study by Sch¨ussler et al. [11] combines GPS data as well as
accelerometer data and the locations of public transport stops
to derive stage start and end times and transportation modes.
They report an accuracy of 92.5%. The study by Rasmussen
et al. [12] implemented a three stage method which combines
GIS rules and fuzzy logic. The method to identify rail trips
was very efﬁcient; however, there are two differences among
our studies. First, they use a small dataset to test their method
while our is bigger and follows an ofﬁcial statistics distribution.
Finally, a dedicated GPS device was used by them during the
data collection while in our case data was gathered through
crowdsourcing using smartphones, so the resolution and the
quality data are different [13]. The study by Biljecki et al. [14]
used geographical data to calculate some indicators, such as
the proximity of the trajectory to the network to perform the
classiﬁcation of single-mode segments. The accuracy of their
method is 91.6%, however they do not report the accuracy by
each transport mode.
Another alternative are the rule-based approaches where
spatial operations are used for ﬁltering out trip segments that
do not correspond to the target transport mode to identify.
They can achieve similar results compared to machine learning
approaches [15]. The study by Stopher et al. [8] used the con-
textual information from the user (e.g., if the household has any
bicycles), or from the transport network (e.g., most bus stops
are located midway along blocks) to build a probability matrix
to determine if the user is walking, biking or driving. Then,
motorized vehicle trips are identiﬁed using street and public
transport GIS layers using an elimination process looking for
what happens before and after the trip segment analyzed (e.g.,
public transport trips usually are among walking trips). This
study used a dedicated GPS device. Data logging was sporadic
in buses or it was non-existent in trains. They classiﬁed a
segment as a train segment when the starting and/or ending
point was on a railway. They do not report the accuracy per
transport mode however they report an overall success rate of
about 95%. Bohte and Maat [9] also use a similar approach
comparing the starting and ending points of a trip against the
locations of train stations of the rail network however they
apply more rules to these points under the assumption that
a train trip take place between the two trips. They report a
success rate 34% for train trip classiﬁcation.
Gong et al. [5] developed a rule-based methodology to
identify ﬁve transport modes (walk, subway, rail, car and bus).
This study was carried in New York city, using a dedicated
GPS device. They report the best success rate (35.7%) for
train trip classiﬁcation to the best of our knowledge. Therefore,
we will perform a comparison with this method. Our studies
have some similarities and differences. The study by Gong
et al. was applied over a small dataset which contains data
generated by 63 volunteers in one week while our was applied
to a large crowdsourcing dataset; however, both dataset are
made of multimodal trips. Our studies differ in the data
collection method, they used a dedicated GPS device while
we used cellphone devices. Regarding to the techniques, both
use train station elements from a GIS layer for classifying
transport mode of GPS segments likewise the previous studies
mentioned, but only both use railway elements to determine
alignment between GPS points and the rail network. Our
technique exploits trafﬁc network elements that belong to
others transport network to improve the elimination process,
i.e., those segments that cross elements, such as motorway
junctions and train stations will be excluded.

METHODOLOGY
This paper presents a comparison among two rule-based
methods that perform transport mode classiﬁcation using GPS
and GIS data.
Gong et al. [5] classiﬁes four transport modes: bus, car,
foot and train. However, we modiﬁed the output to focus only
on train classiﬁcation. This method uses ﬁve rules to identify
walking segments, four rules to identify train segments, and
ﬁnally four rules to classify bus and car segments. This method
uses rail stations and rail links to establish whether the GPS
points that belong to a trip segment follow the railway or not.
The rules used to detect train trips in this study are listed as
follows:
1)
Distance from ﬁrst point of trip segment to the nearest
subway entrance <100 m or to the nearest commuter
rail station <200 m; or distance from ﬁrst point of
trip segment to nearest subway or commuter rail link
endpoint <200 m
2)
Distance from last point of trip segment to nearest
subway entrance <100 m or to the nearest commuter
rail station <200 m; or distance from last point of
trip segment to nearest subway link endpoint <200
m
3)
Distance from each point of trip segment to nearest
subway or commuter rail link <60 m
4)
If possibly elevated train, then distance from each
stopped point to nearest subway station <184 m or
to the nearest commuter rail station <311m
In our work, the transport mode classiﬁcation is performed
based on the assumption that a train trip segment is a trip
segment which along its path includes at least one train
station, follows the railway and does not include other transport
network elements, such as motorway junctions. We use a set
of rules to ﬁlter out all those trips that do not comply with
these characteristics.
First, we smoothed the segments using a speed-based ﬁlter
to ﬁltered out GPS point with high speed. We used 300 km/h
as threshold due to the high-speed trains that uses part of
the railway network. Second, we extracted Passing Points,
such as train stations and railways, and Non-Passing Points,
such as motorway junctions, from OSM. Then, Non-Passing
131

elements that intercept with Passing elements were excluded
(e.g., using a 100 meters buffer around railways, we excluded
motorway junctions which were close to railways). Third, we
performed spatial operations to ﬁlter out non train segments.
The smoothed trip segments were intercepted with train station
buffers to keep segments which cross train stations. The
remaining segments were intercepted with motorway junctions,
which are distant from railways, to ﬁlter out every possible
car segment. Finally, a distance-based ﬁlter between the GPS
points of the remaining segments and railways was applied
to ﬁlter out segments that are not following the railway. The
remaining trip segments correspond to the train trip segments.
We designed ﬁve experiments for testing our proposed
method. In each experiment, we built a classiﬁer following
the rules of each method. We identiﬁed three parameters in
common among the methods: the train station buffer radius,
the amount of necessary GPS points, and the distance between
GPS points and railways.

EXPERIMENT EVALUATION
A. Dataset
In this study, we used a labeled subset of 4,534 trip
segments, which correspond to 178 devices from the dataset
collected during the GPSWAL mobility survey, a crowdsourc-
ing travel survey carried out between 2016 and 2017 by the
L’Institut Wallon de l’´evaluation, de la Prospective et de la
Statistique (IWEPS), in Belgium. This dataset was described
in our previous work [6]. Figure 1 shows a sample of GPSWAL
segments.

The distribution of the trip segments by transport modes
follows the modal split described by the Flemish Travel
Behavior Survey OVG 5.1 [16] and is depicted in Table I.

To implement both methods, we used four GIS data sources
to extract transport network elements. The following layers
were created and data transformation and cleaning processes
were performed over them:
1)
Bus stops from bus agencies: De Lijn, TEC Walloon
and MIVB/STIB Brussels
2)
Train stations from OpenStreetMap
3)
Railways from OpenStreetMap
4)
Motorway junctions from OpenStreetMap
B. Evaluation
Each experiment was repeated changing the threshold of
the parameters to ﬁnd the best classiﬁer, i.e., every possible
combination of the parameter values was evaluated. We com-
puted a confusion matrix for every operating point to gather
information about the classiﬁer’s performance. The following
rates were calculated using the confusion matrix:
ACC =
(TP + TN)
(FP + FN + TP + TN)
(1)
PRE =
TP
(TP + FP)
(2)
TPR =
TP
(TP + FN)
(3)
FPR =
FP
(FP + TN)
(4)
where TP is the True Positive, FP is the False Positive, FN
is False Negative, and TN is True Negative. Here, ACC and
PRE are accuracy and precision, respectively. These rates are
valid only for one single operating point. Shifting the decision
threshold of the classiﬁer, we plotted values of True Positive
Rate (TPR) against False Positive Rate (FPR). The resulting
curve is called a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve [17]. ROC graphs are useful tools for selecting models
for classiﬁcation based on their performance with respect to
the false positive and true positive rates [18]. Figure 2 shows
those ROC for the ﬁrst experiment.

points and railways is 30 m, train station buffer is 100 m.
The optimal classiﬁer in every experiment was selected
using the ROC Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC). In general,
a ROC AUC with the highest value identiﬁes the classiﬁer
with the best performance. To identify the operating point
that represents the combination of parameters with the best
performance, we computed the Euclidean distance to the top-
left corner of the ROC curve for each cutoff value. This is
deﬁned as follows:

(5)
where TPR is the true positive rate and FPR is the false
positive rate. We selected the best operating point based on the
lowest distances to the corner. Finally, using the ROC AUC
and the Euclidean distance metrics, we perform the comparison
between the ﬁve classiﬁers.

EXPERIMENTS
Before performing the experiments, we determined the
threshold of each parameter.
In the literature, spatial buffer size has been used in other
studies to analyze public transport facilities [19], transport
classiﬁcation [5][14] or public transport ﬂow analysis [20].
This parameter usually ranges from 20 to 1000 meters. Gong
et al. [5] ﬁxed the radius value in 200 m. Figure 3 shows how
many train segments cross the train stations when the buffer
radius increases. In our method, it was ﬁxed in 100 m, 93.33%
of the train segments cross at a distance less than or equal
to this. For the benchmarking, we performed the experiments
using these two values to set the buffer radius.

Figure 3. Number of train segments crossing around train stations.
Gong et al. [5] used the total number of GPS-point’ seg-
ment for classifying, i.e., 100% of GPS points. We wondered
which is the minimum amount of GPS points from a train trip
segment to classify it as such. We changed this parameter in
steps of 5% in each iteration, ranging from 5% to 100%.
The distance between GPS points and railways was ﬁxed
to 60 meters in the study by Gong et al. [5]. We analyzed the
labeled train segments to determine the appropriated range of
values to change the threshold of this parameter. We found that
GPS points from train segments were in average 18.19 meters
far from rail ways, while the maximum distance was 217.56
meters. Hence, the possible values of this parameter are in a
range between 15 and 220 meter, we changed this parameter
in steps of 5 meters in each iteration.
The ﬁrst experiment consisted in applying our method [6]
to the labeled dataset. The results have shown that there are
misclassiﬁed train segments; this occurred when a segment
crossed more than one train station, but it does not use
railways. Another issue not handled by this version was the
non-classiﬁcation of train segments when they cross only one
train station. We improved our method incorporating a stage
to ﬁlter further non-train segments using the amount of GPS
points needed per segment as well as the distance between
those points and the rail ways. We compared the performance
of both versions computing a confusion matrix in each case.
The values of the confusion matrices are shown in Figure 4.

The second experiment consisted in the implementation of
the method by Gong et al. [5]. We conﬁgured the parameters
according to the values established in their method. Figure 5a
shows the confusion matrix computed after applying this
method on the labeled dataset. Figure 5 shows the confusion
matrix of the classiﬁer modiﬁed to focus only on train classi-
ﬁcation. We evaluated the method to determine which are the
best parameter values to built the best classiﬁer. The confusion

We performed three additional experiments combining the
rules used by Gong et al. [5] for detecting train trips. Ex-
periment three consisted in combining rules one and three,
so this experiment analyze the starting point and how far the
GPS points which belong to a segment are from the railways.
Experiment four combines rules two and three. In this case,
ending points and how far the GPS points which belong to a
segment are analyzed. The last experiment uses rules one or
two combined with rule three. Hence, segments that start or
end in a train station are analyzed in conjunction with how far
their GPS points are from the railways.
The confusion matrices at the best operating point for each
experiment performed with Gong et al. [5] method are shown
in Figure 6. The parameter values, performance rates, and
metrics calculated for the best classiﬁers are shown in Table II.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents the results of the performed compar-
isons. We have evaluated two methods through ﬁve experi-
ments, one corresponds to our method which uses Passing and
Non-Passing Points and four correspond to Gong et al. [5]
method which uses only Passing Points. The dataset has an
unbalanced set of classes, e.g., the target class represents only
1.69% of the data.
Before benchmarking, we performed the value choice of
the three parameters in common between the methods: the
train station buffer radius, the amount of necessary GPS
points, and the distance between GPS points and railways. In
each experiment, we selected the classiﬁers that maximize the
relation between the true positive rate and the false positive rate
instead of only considering the accuracy or precision. Figure 7
shows the benchmarking using the ROC AUC as metric. The
parameter values, computed rates and metrics of each ROC
curves are showed in Table II.
Results showed that the ROC AUC in experiment two had
the lowest values. After analyzing this scenario, we realized
that rules of the method by Gong et al. [5] were too restrictive
for the used railway network and dataset quality [21]. Because
of this, we performed three other experiments to test its
behavior with less restrictive rules. This classiﬁer has an
accuracy of 97.85% while its true positive rate is 0.13, the
lowest among the experiments. The results of experiment three
showed us an improvement of the method by Gong et al. [5]
in the identiﬁcation of positive cases when only rules one

Figure 7. Benchmarking for the ﬁve experiment using the ROC AUC metric
and three are combined. In comparison with experiment two,
we observed that in this experiment the true positive rate and
precision are better, however the accuracy is lower. The results
of experiment four showed a good performance, i.e., when only
segments and end train stations are used. This experiment had
the highest rate values when we applied the method by Gong
et al. [5] to the dataset. Nevertheless, the ROC AUC value does
not represent the best classiﬁer with this method. Experiment
ﬁve used a combination between rule number one or two with
rule number three used. In this case, the results showed the
best ROC AUC value using the method by Gong et al. [5]
besides having the best true positive rate among experiments
with this method. However, the number of false positive cases
increased.
When comparing the results obtained from the bench-
marking between the method by Gonzalez and the proposed
method, we determined that our classiﬁer presents a better
performance in relation with the true positive rate. For instance,
we classiﬁed correctly 84 trips out of every 100 train trips,
while the method by Gong et al. [5] only identiﬁed 68 trips.
However, both methods misclassiﬁed 2 train trips in every 100
trips.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we reported a comparison performed among
location based methods which aim to classify transport mode.
We have also presented the design, execution and results of
the experiments performed with each method. Additionally,
the inﬂuence of the parameters of the tested algorithms has
been experimentally studied with the purpose of performing a
fair comparison. Finally, we have shown the results of the best
classiﬁer according to the ROC curves.
The objective of this paper was to perform a comparison
between a methodology that only uses Passing Point elements,
and a methodology which uses both Passing and Non-Passing

Points, applying both on a dataset where the transport-mode
classes are unbalanced. Previous works in transport mode
classiﬁcation only report successful rate but the results showed
that in addition to calculate the accuracy and precision of
a method, it is also necessary to calculate the true positive
and false positive rates to evaluate the classiﬁer performance.
According to the ROC graph, the proposed method has the
greatest ROC AUC value, i.e., it has a better performance
in comparison with the method by Gong et al. [5]. The
true positive rate of the proposed methodology is 84% in
comparison with 64% obtained by the best classiﬁer using the
method by Gong et al. [5]. For future work, we plan to apply
the proposed method to classify other transport modes (e.g.,
bus) or combining it with other kind of techniques. We also
plan to explore transport classiﬁcation with unbalanced classes
using crowdsourcing data.
