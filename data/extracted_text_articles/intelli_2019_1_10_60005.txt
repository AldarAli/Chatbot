Abstract—In this paper, we demonstrate how to analyze the WiFi
data of the German highspeed trains called InterCityExpress
(ICE) on the basis of a neural network. To achieve this, we apply
a Self-Enforcing Network with cue validity factors to underline
the importance of selected features. It is shown that the quality
of the WiFi connection, in terms of the rate of downloads and the
latency, can be grouped and explained by just a few determinants.
We will show where the network coverage is especially good or
bad and suggest ways to improve this quality to enhance the
comfort of traveling on the highspeed trains and therefore to
possible expand the proﬁts of the operating company.
Keywords–Self-Enforcing Network (SEN); self-organized learn-
ing; cue validity factor; Intelligent data analysis; Industry 4.0 data

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the demand for mobile Internet access
grew at a rapid pace. The reasons for this development are
diverse. There is ongoing research on how this change affects
people in various ways (e.g., [1][2]). Furthermore, there is a
growing literature trying to identify the factors which drive the
ongoing rise in demand [3][4]. While user habits change, new
challenges, and opportunities for many businesses arise.
Technical challenges to manage wireless networks in gen-
eral [5][6] and in highspeed trains in particular [7][8], are
discussed in numerous recent publications, using very different
algorithms like k-means, deep- and reinforcement learning,
support vector machines, optimization algorithms, Decision
Trees, Naive Bayes, to name only a few [5][9][10][11][12][13].
Despite the analysis of technical improvements, the possibility
to get other information such as the numbers of train travelers
using mobile phone data ([14] for an overview), or how
passengers use travel time [15][16] are also of interest.
In an increasingly competitive transportation industry, the
existence of free mobile Internet access will be a crucial factor
to attract new customers [17]. That is why the biggest German
railway company “Deutsche Bahn AG” announced to offer
a free WiFi system to all travelers on their highspeed trains
in the course of their quality improvement program “Zukunft
Bahn” [18]. The main goal of this program is to achieve higher
customer satisfaction and hence to expand their proﬁts.
This paper contributes to this sphere by analyzing the
supply side of mobile Internet access. To be more speciﬁc,
we analyze the user experience when using the WiFi network
that is provided on German highspeed trains (ICEs) in different
regions of Germany.
In particular, the analysis of GPS based data with tradi-
tional statistical methods is challenging. While, for example,
regression approaches are good at describing continuous linear
and nonlinear relationships between variables and are com-
putationally simple, they are not suited for clustering data.
Algorithms like k-means clustering are better suited but still
require quite strong assumptions like knowledge about the
exact number of clusters in the data. Therefore, we utilized
a self-organized learning neural network to analyze a dataset
containing locations speciﬁc WiFi data [19]. The usage of this
self-organized learning neural network enabled us to analyze
the data with only a minimum of prior assumptions needed
and without the need of prior variable selection.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section II describes the Self-Enforcing Network (SEN). In
section III, the technology for providing the WiFi on the trains,
the data used and methodology are explained. In section IV,
the key results are presented focusing on factors affecting the
network coverage; section V concludes.

THE SELF-ENFORCING NETWORK (SEN)
SEN is a self-organized learning neural network, developed
by the Research Group “Computer-Based Analysis of Social
Complexity” (CoBASC). Only the functionalities that are
relevant to this analysis are brieﬂy presented. More detailed
descriptions of the SEN are found in, e.g., [20][21]. The
data, consisting of attributes and objects, are represented in
a “semantical matrix” where the rows represent the objects o,
and the columns represent the attributes a. The values in the
matrix wao represent the degree of afﬁliation of an attribute
to an object. In this case, the semantical matrix contains the
preprocessed real data imported from .csv-ﬁles (see below).
The training of the network is done by transforming the
(min-max normalized) values of the semantical matrix into
the weight matrix of the network according to the learning
rule. The most speciﬁc for SEN is, that the weight values
are not generated at random (as usually in neural networks),
1

INTELLI 2019 : The Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Applications

meaning that the weight matrix displays the real data. In
addition, a “cue validity factor” (cvf) [22][20] is introduced to
exclude, to dampen, or to increase the importance of selected
attributes. The whole learning rule is then deﬁned as follows
(see Equation 1) with w being the assigned weight and c being
a constant deﬁned as 0 ≤ c ≤ 1:
w(t + 1) = w(t) + ∆w, and
∆w = c ∗ wao ∗ cvfa
(1)
As in any neural network, the activation functions play
an important role. In SEN several activation functions are at
disposal [23]; in this study we have used the logarithmic-linear
activation function (LLF), which is deﬁned as follows (see
Equation 2) with wij being the value of the (i, j)th Element
of the weight matrix and ai being the corresponding values of
the semantical matrix:
aj =
X log3(ai + 1) ∗ wij,
if ai ≥ 0.
log3(|ai + 1|) ∗ −wij,
else.
(2)
The logarithmic-linear activation function is well suited for
our purpose because the dataset includes many extreme obser-
vations and also differs much across the different variables.
This logarithmic-linear function ensures that those extreme
values do not receive weights that would be too high otherwise
and thus outweigh the other (smaller) values.

DATA DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS
To understand how the WiFi on a German Highspeed Train
(ICE) works, the technical background will be discussed here
shortly.
Figure 1 gives an overview of the installed hardware on the
ICEs to provide the local WiFi. The base of this system is the
combined infrastructure of the three big telecommunication
companies Telekom, Telef´onica, and Vodafone, resulting in
a more stable system and better network coverage [18]. The
signals (the data) coming from cell towers of all three providers
are received by the antenna mounted on top of the train.
Then the collected stream of data is processed by the router
to merge the different signals and is sent to different access
points across the train, from which the travelers can access
the mobile Internet by connecting to the WiFi Network. To be
recognizable, the Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID) of this Network
is always set to “WiFionICE”.
A. Data
The dataset called “WiFi on ICE” which is analyzed in this
paper is provided by the Deutsche Bahn AG [19]. This dataset
consists of about 23.5 million observations with 15 variables.
Table I sums up all variables which we have used in our
analysis. The sid stores a unique ID of each router used in the
trains. Together with the GPS variables, it is possible to match
observations to individual train connections. Furthermore, the
rate of downloads and the latency are essential factors that
inﬂuence the user experience. High rates of download are
good because the content will be downloaded faster, e.g., a
website can be displayed fast, or a movie can be played at
higher image quality. High latency values, on the other hand,
are undesirable. The latency values describe the time which
passes until an initial response from the server is received.

Additionally, we included the rate of uploads and data on
the number of devices connected to the network to check the
consistency of our results and to interpret the latter.
B. Preprocessing the Data
To get a ﬁrst impression of the dataset, we utilized R-
Studio. R-Studio is an integrated development environment
which allows to comfortably program in the statistical pro-
gramming language R [24].
Because of the huge number of observations looking at them
individually was not feasible. Therefore, we looked at ﬁrst
at the number of missing values. In 2 variables, namely gps v
and gps richtung, the amount of missing observations exceeds
about 10%. In consequence, we omitted all observations that
have missing values. This step was necessary to interpret the
results later on. Furthermore, we transformed the variable con-
cerning the velocity of the train by multiplying with the factor
3.6 to obtain velocities in kilometers per hour instead of meters
per second, which was the original unit of measurement. We
excluded observations with an altitude lower than -80 meters
and or speed of over 350 kilometers per hour. This is because
velocities much larger than this value cannot be reached by an
ICE train. Therefore those values have to be seen as results
of measurement errors. Lastly, we created a unique identiﬁer
which functions as a label. This allows us to easily search
for an individual observation of interest when needed. Finally,
we are left with 10.1 million observations. Those observations
are used to analyze two different train connections across

Germany. We chose connections to cover a good amount of
the German railway network. The selection of individual train
connections was possible by using the sid variable. The dataset
after preprocessing, which is used in the subsequent analysis,
is visualized in Figure 2.
C. Clustering the Data
For clustering the data with regard to the rate of downloads
and the latency, the selected data is reduced once more to
1, 000 observations per chosen connection. Those observations
are not chosen at random but regularly over the entire observed
period of time (e.g., one observation per minute).
Those in total 2, 000 observations in 8 variables are then
labeled with their relative latency, and rate of download
and afterward imported into Self-Enforcing Network Second
Edition (SEN.SE) the tool for applying the neural network
and visualizing the results. The ﬁrst step then was letting the
Self-Enforcing Network (SEN) structure the given data without
further information or any adjustments. This procedure resulted
in the following visualization (see Figure 3).
There are clearly some clusters, and there is some structure
in the data. This is good news because it is evidence that the
data is not uniformly distributed, i.e., there is information that
can be extracted by further analyzing the dataset.
To steer the clustering towards the variables of interest,
the available settings and parameters are set differently. As
already mentioned, the Cue Validity Factor (CVF) is a measure
for to which extent attributes are associated with a particular
category. Therefore one can adjust the importance of an
attribute by setting the value of its CVF. If it is set to a high
value (i.e., CVF = 1 or possibly even higher), the attribute
is highly relevant. If it is set to zero (i.e., CVF = 0), the

values.
attribute is not important at all and therefore not considered in
the following clustering process.
The value of the CVF for the attributes we want to explain
(i.e., the rate of downloads and the latency) is set to the highest
value, i.e., 1. The values of the CVF for the other attributes
is lowered stepwise until a clear grouping of the objects is
reached. A good starting point for setting the CVFs is the
correlations between the variables we want to explain and the
other covariates. A (in absolute) high correlation indicates that
the speciﬁc CVF should be set relatively high at the beginning
of the process of lowering the values of the CVF for the
attributes. The correlations between all the variables in the
dataset are visualized in Figure 4. The resulting values of the
CVFs are given in Table II. Those adjustments on the SEN then
result in the following clustering of the data (see Figure 5).
One can see that the data now is ordered in a very different
way. Observations with high normalized latency values (red
labels) are sorted in the bottom right corner whereas smaller
values (i.e., observations with a smaller normalized latency)
are sorted in the top left corner (blue labels). The respective

latency values are displayed right next to the corresponding
red markers. This clustering, on the one hand, allows us to
select regions of observations with very high or low latency
or download rates to further analyze them utilizing R. On the
other hand one obtains a good impression how the observations
are distributed according to their latency values or download
rates.

RESULTS
This section presents the key results obtained from the
analysis of two different routes across Germany.
A. Berlin - Cologne
ICE line 10, the connection between Berlin in East Ger-
many and Cologne in West Germany, links two important areas
of high population density. As the red points in Figure 6 reveal,
the rates of downloads are high, especially at the train stations
in the major cities. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows that the line
segment between Cologne and Hanover is characterized by
high rates of downloads whereas the segment between Hanover
and Berlin consists of mostly low rates of downloads (indicated
by the blue points) with only a few exceptions. Those high

rates can be caused by either many active devices in the WiFi
or by a bad connection to the Internet.
The latter hypothesis can be evaluated with regard to the
latency. Looking at Figure 6 again, it becomes clear, that
the latency is far more volatile over the entire length of the
connection than the rate of downloads. In particular, between
Hanover and Berlin, the latency is constantly relative high
explaining the in general lower rates of downloads in this
segment. This could possibly be explained by the fact that this
region is not highly populated. Therefore the infrastructure of
mobile communication may not be that far developed (like
for example a larger distance between the cell towers) as
for example in the Ruhr area with a much higher population
density.
B. Binz - Munich

Germany. High latency values and high rates of downloads are
indicated in red, whereas low ones are blue. It can be seen that
on the one hand near Binz, a small coastal town on an island
in the Baltic Sea, the rates of downloads are typically low.
This comes as no surprise because the population density of
this region is quite low. This is also reﬂected in the usage data,
i.e., there are very few devices authenticated to the network.
On the other hand, there are quite a few observations with high
download rates between Berlin and Nuremberg.
Looking at the latency values, one can notice the low values
near Binz. Hence the supply is very good while there is no
great demand for it. On the contrary, there is high demand
between Berlin and Munich, on average, there are more than
100 devices connected, but the latency is very high most of the
time. The latter especially holds between Berlin and Leipzig.
Between Leipzig and Nuremberg, the values of the latency are
very volatile, which means that the connection to the WiFi
might be unstable. Other interesting observations are the high
latency values at Munich; they contrast with most observations
in other big cities. Unfortunately, the download rates are
average at Munich, so it is difﬁcult to assess any further
conclusions. At least there is some room for improvement
around Munich.
V.
CONCLUSION
In the preceding chapters, we showed how to analyze the
WiFi attributes of two selected line-sections of the German
railroad network using a SEN. To visualize our results, we
used the statistical programming language R. High relevance
of our analysis is attributed to the GPS data itself, the download
rate, latency and the authenticated devices in the network.
While well known statistical approaches suffered fulﬁlling our
requirements, the SEN enabled us to cluster the data without
extensive prior model speciﬁcation.
Our results show a good quality of the WiFi in Northern
Germany near Binz. Rather bad quality can be expected when
traveling between Berlin and Munich. The identiﬁcation of
areas where the supply of mobile Internet access is good or
bad was possible.
We assumed that the user experience using the WiFi
mainly depends on the latency and the download rate. To
prove this, one could analyze the correlation between data
on the user experience and our results. Unfortunately, we
were not able to gather data on the user experience, so this
remains an exciting area of subsequent research. Furthermore,
subsequent research could utilize our methodology to analyze
which factors determine the connection between trains and cell
towers by including additional data like micro deployment data
of the antennas (e.g., the distance between antennas, signal
strength, load, etc.). Unfortunately, micro-deployment data is
rarely publicly available. This would allow exploiting further
relationships between the quality of the WiFi on the ICEs
and the mobile network in Germany. Furthermore, one could
explore the relationships between train delays and network
usage.
While our results cannot be generalized because they are
speciﬁc for Germany, the generalization of our methodology
should be possible. Our analysis mainly relies on the assump-
tion that WiFi access is positively correlated to the customer
satisfaction of railway companies. If this assumption holds, and
proper data is available, one can conduct the same analysis for
other countries.
