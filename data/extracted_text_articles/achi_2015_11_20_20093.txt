Abstract—The 
mining 
industry 
is 
interested 
in 
novel 
visualization systems to improve operational efficiency. 
Technologies to enhance the operator’s experience are 
advancing but there is a lack of evidence supporting the extent 
to which these emerging technologies positively affect user 
experience and performance. In this paper, we describe 
initiative of web based immersive panoramic display system 
that could be used in mining context. This idea represents a 
step towards new platforms that will increase the efficiency 
and safety of the mining operations by video monitoring with 
annotations of information coming from analytics engines.

I.  PAST WORK 
In the past, we have developed a Panoramic Display 
System that was effectively used in scientific and industrial 
environments to visualize 360-degree panoramas in real-time 
(15FPS) [1]-[3]. The video was constructed out of six 
streams of images captured by PointGrey LadyBug3 camera 
[4]. The camera was located in a remote operating location, 
and stitched video buffers were sent to a location where 3-m 
hemispherical dome was installed. The stitched images were 
displayed on the virtual sphere and transformed to a fisheye 
projection in order to have proper mapping proportions and 
viewing perspectives, see Figures 1 and 2.

II. WEB BASED PANORAMIC SYSTEMS 
The new prototype is currently under development for 
displaying immersive video environments using technologies 
supported or natively built into modern web browsers 
(WebGL [5], WebCL [6], WebRTC [7]). Based on our 
previous experience, we intend to develop and use the 
capabilities of 360-degree immersive video in web-based 
environments, but with playback inside of a Head Mounted 
Display (HMD), such as, an Oculus Rift [8] (see Figure 3), 
3-m hemispherical dome, or in the browser window itself.

The equipment to be used to produce 360-degree videos, 
is six or twelve GoPro 3+ cameras mounted on 3D printed 
mounts, 360-HEROS [9]. The videos are to be played back,

inside the web browser (Figure 4), in full-screen mode. 
WebGL based code is used for rending. Additional 
functionality will be provided to enable video streaming 
using standard web technology, WebRTC, for multi-users 
chat and data communication in web browsers. The intention 
is to have multiple users existing and observing the same 
virtual environments. Discussions and measurements of 
objects in the environment could also occur through 
placement of 3-D annotations. 
 
III. CONCLUSIONS 
The present paper described new prototype for displaying 
robust immersive video environments using modern web 
technologies natively built into web browsers. Such system 
would have many potential applications; some of them are 
listed below: 
• 
3D movies for training purposes, 
• 
Immersive Tele-conference systems, 
• 
Manufacturing, 
• 
Remote supervision, 
• 
Forensics.
