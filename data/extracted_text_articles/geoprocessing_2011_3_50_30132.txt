Abstract—There 
are 
many 
indicators 
of 
sustainable 
development of towns defined by urban specialists, sociologists, 
economists, etc. The paper presents the first part of a project 
whose goal is to find indicators of harmonic development of 
towns based on analysis of forty years development of fifty 
Czech towns. The indicators are studied in land use spatial 
changes, demography and road traffic intensity changes. First 
ten towns were processed for the period between 1970 and 
2009 being mapped in general urban land use classes and 
related to the measured road density. City land use class areas 
were derived from combination of actual and historical city 
plans and remote sensing data using GIS tools. It was found 
that the traffic intensity within towns and to and from towns is 
more dependent on existence of close highways and by-pass 
roads unlike number of inhabitants, e.g. Political changes from 
the communist regime to the democratic one was also an 
important breakpoint in the city developments. Increase of the 
road traffic intensity and enlarging of residential areas are 
features proving the fact. The paper presents a methodology of 
spatial mapping of land use classes utilized for determination 
of town development. The town developments and their 
relation to road traffic is presented on maps and graphs. 
 
Keywords-GIS, remote sensing data, city plan, number of 
inhabitants, urban model,  land use, road traffic intensity,

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The development of cities during last decades has faced 
us with a new situation. Most inhabitants in many European 
countries are concentrated in large towns. One fifth of the 
Czech Republic population is living in three largest towns – 
Prague, Brno and Ostrava. 
Present state of the balance among consumption level of 
society and quality of life is a matter of scientific papers, 
research [2], [3], [4], many projects [1], [7], and political and 
economical discussions in many countries. Life quality is 
directly related to a lot of environmental and socio-
economic conditions. These conditions determine a 
harmonic development which should be based on equivalent 
and adequate demands of the human society. To define 
―adequate‖ means to take into account both consumption, 
and quality of life. Both are closely connected to the road 
traffic and its intensity. 
The Department of Mapping and Cartography has been 
processing a project focused on a detailed evaluation of 
relations between the quality of life and present behavior of 
the human society. The project goal is to create a model 
allowing improving the present development status in urban 
areas  being less demanding to ensure their sustainable 
development. 
The project is a logical continuation of several projects 
performed by specialists from the Czech Technical 
University in Prague in the Czech Republic and the State 
Institute for Regional Planning who have collected and 
summarized large data volume of fifty towns (including 
three largest ones - Prague, Brno and Ostrava) on: 
1. Functional typology comprising five classes 
housing and infrastructure areas, industrial and 
agricultural  areas, areas of  transport, areas of 
recreation including sport and green vegetation 
land, and areas of other functions, 
2. Urban, agriculture, forest and water surface areas 
and other function areas from the Czech Office for 
Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre (COSMC) and 
Czech Statistical Office. The data are related to 
1970, 1980, 1990, 2000,  2003, 2005 and 2008, 
3. Basic components of the environment, 
4. Basic components of the social and economical 
development. 
The previous projects were focused on statistical data 
collected from the above mentioned sources and their 
processing. They did not comprise any spatial data and no 
spatial analyses were performed. Their city collection 
resulted in a large range of cities differing by size (from ten 
thousand to more than one million, by economic orientation 
(agricultural, industrial, university, touristic), by natural 
conditions (lowland surrounded by agricultural areas,

mountainous situated large forest areas), by geographic 
position in the republic – close/far to a frontier, etc. The city 
set is a good sample covering practically all Czech city 
types. 
       The processed project is focused on two new views – to 
select suitable indicators of the sustainable city development 
in the Czech Republic using also spatial characteristics 
together with already collected ones, and the role of the road 
transport intensity in the development. 
land use city maps 
Individual land use areas offer different conditions for 
living. The same land use classes in different areas and 
therefore all spatial units are characterized by a long list of 
attributes.  
The spatial town development of first nine towns was 
derived from city plans designed by local administration, 
from aerial photographs collected between 1950 and 2008, 
and satellite image data (Thematic Mapper, MSS data) 
covering period between 1970 and 2000. The system of 
determination of individual time level of land use maps was 
based on map vector data representing municipal maps and 
the remote sensing data. Their content allowed to verify 
whether the mapped units are reality or the project author´s 
proposal. 
The 
supervised 
classification 
(maximum 
likelihood – used very often for land use/cover classification 
by many remote sensing specialists - [7], [8], e.g.) made the 
verification easier and quicker. The latest land use map was 
the first processed level and further step headed back to the 
previous levels. The land use maps were controlled by the 
statistical data of the Czech Statistical Office and Czech 
Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre. Individual 
statuses for above mentioned years in urban land use 
functional classes – areas of housing, areas of facilities, 
industrialized areas, transport areas, recreational areas, 
green areas, and other areas. 
II. 
ROAD TRAFFIC DATA 
A large data base of the road network development has 
been created by the Road and Motorway Directorate. The 
data base comprises - among others - measurements of the 
road traffic intensity in many points of roads of various road 
classes since 60-ies (1968, 1973, 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, and 2010) of the 20th century. The road traffic intensity 
is a number of vehicles. per 24 hours which passed through a 
determined point on a road in both directions. The 
measurements are collected in several thousands of selected 
locations in the Czech Republic and represent 24 hours´ 
period. It is an average of several 24 hours´ s data collection. 
The measurements are available in map forms where each 
location is marked together with total amount of passed 
vehicles (including motorcycles), and tables where the 
amount is enumerated in a more detailed way distinguishing 
heavy-duty vehicles, cars and motorcycles.  
III. 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA 
A deep analysis of another large data volume which has 
been collected since the second half of the 20th century will 
be performed in the proposed project. The data comprise 10-
year research of socio-economic data of environmental 
changes performed at the University of Economics in 
Prague, e.g. Each city is described by several hundreds of 
statistical data. The data were collected by many students of 
the University within their thesis. The processing of the data 
is not presented in this paper and is a matter of the further 
research.  
 
IV. 
CZECH TOWNS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT 
The Czech Republic does not have a continuous political 
and urban development. The development was formed 
mainly by political decisions having a decisive role of the 
urban land use changes. After the Second World War the 
urban development was relatively uneven and can be 
characterized by three types of cities. One type of cities had 
only a relatively slow and continuous spatial evolution 
within their administrative boundaries. The second type are 
cities with growing administrative areas; however, this 
growth was artificial as a result of political decisions to join 
surrounding villages to a close city.  The third group of 
towns is similar to the second one; the only deference is in 
the further separation of one or more early joined villages. 
This development classification was firstly described and 
denoted by Vepřek [8]. He uses three new terms: core area 
for town size representing in most cases a status in 1970. It 
was a year when the process of joining villages to neighbor 
cities became an important phenomenon in administrative 
structure of the country. The joined areas are named 
associated areas by Vepřek in [8]. Urban parts in associated 
regions are called agglomerated ones. The parts which 
became independent villages later on, are called peripheral 
areas Vepřek in [8].  
This spatial development is archived in Cadastre books in 
the form of table records showing concerned cadastre 
districts.  The transfer of this information can show the 
spatial city development using the cadastre districts´ 
boundaries of an appropriate period. This transfer was 
performed also into city plans, whose processing intervals 
vary in individual towns. City size evolutions cannot be 
derived from remote sensing data. If a town belongs to the 
second or third group, there are large spatial changes. The 
largest parts of these changes are in prevailing part 
represented by agricultural areas.  The main difference 
between a core area and associated area are separated urban 
parts occurring in them. 
V. 
LAND USE CLASSES DETERMINATION 
Land use class definitions were created from land use 
classes applied by urban engineers in city plans which were 
processed in several-year periods. Their classes in different 
cities are not standardized even though their dissimilarities in 
76

various cities are not important. However, their classification 
is too detailed for a general land use evaluation and was 
simplified to seven or nine land use classes in urbanized 
areas which were finally reclassified to five functional urban 
classes. These were the city plans which were the first 
information layer for urban land use maps processing.   
The first step of preparing urban land use classes is a 
reclassification of detailed legend classes. The final 
functional classes were residential, production, recreational, 
traffic and other areas. Each class is therefore formed by a 
higher number of city plan classes. The residential area is 
formed by mixed residential region, general residential and 
rural ones, and public areas. The reclassification means also 
including  local roads belonging to roads of low level in the 
state roads hierarchy into residential or  other surrounding 
areas. The reclassification is performed individually for each 
town according to its city plan classes.   
The advantage of this approach was the fact that the basic 
classification was performed by urban specialists, however,  
city plans comprise not only a real status, but also an urban 
plan. Therefore the next step was to verify the present city 
plans and the real state of towns as the plans comprise plans 
which may and really significantly differ from the real state 
especially in newly urbanized areas. This part of the 
processing was done by visual interpretation of the remote 
sensing data (aerial photographs) combined with a change 
registration/vectorization of the vector city plan and the 
result was a map of functional classes of the present state. 
The forty years development was divided into 
determination of previous phase maps of functional classes 
in 2000, 1990, 1980 and 1970. The process started in the 
latest period and ended in 1970. These maps were processed 
using remote sensing data. Two types of remote sensing data 
were used for the change detection allowing mapping of the  
given year. The latest map (2008) was a result of the present 
city plan processing by implementing corrections found in 
discrepancies between the plan and aerial orthophotographs. 
Satellite data - Thematic Mapper (TM) data - were utilized 
for determination of land cover changes. They were derived 
from a subtraction of original satellite image bands and 
normalized vegetation index in two different years (2008 
band minus 2000 band). Found changes were pixels with 
high positive or negative values. This approach yielded areas 
with different land cover, however, there was an additional 
task to determine and ―translate‖ a land cover change into a 
land use change. Each functional class comprises a wide 
range of the land cover classes in the aerial photographs 
spatial resolution; however, these detailed classes are not in 
prevailing part detectable on the Thematic Mapper data. The 
Thematic Mapper resolution does not allow determining 
urban functional classes – agriculture area spectral behavior 
can be similar to vegetated areas for some plants, etc. The 
areas with important changes (extreme positive and negative 
pixel values) were verified using the aerial photograph taking 
into account also their shape and texture. The oldest map 
showing the 1970 year was also visually controlled using 
aerial 
orthophotomosaic 
created 
from 
aerial 
orthophotographs collected in 50-ies in the last century.  
All functional classes were controlled by the statistical 
table data available at the Czech Office for Surveying, 
Mapping and Cadastre for  city administrative areas. The 
functional classes in individual years were used for further 
evaluation 
between 
road 
transport 
density, 
town 
development and investments into road network in the form 
of new by-pass, highways, etc. Following indicators showing 
the relation were: development of functional class areas, 
development of number of inhabitants, development of road 
transport density, and building of new decongesting roads. 
VI. 
RESULTS 
First nine cities processed in the first year of the project 
have brought very interesting results.  
Kladno is one of processed towns situated 30 km north 
west from Prague. The town consists both of a core, and 
associated parts. The city was an industrial city in the 
communist period of the republic. The industrial production 
has been extremely declining since 1990 and most 
inhabitants are employed in Prague at present. Figure 1 
shows spatial changes of four functional classes between 
1969 and 2009 mapped by the above mentioned method. The 
dashed line (Figure 1 a) determines the core area as an 
administrative city boundary at the end of the 70-ies in the 
20th century. The solid line delineates the administrative city 
boundary since 80-ies of the previous century which has not 
changed. The red color patches are residential areas in 1969. 
The green patches are residential areas built between 1969 
and 2008.

Development of production areas is shown on Figure 1b, 
facility areas on Figure 1c), and traffic areas on Figure 1d.  
Town development is further presented on two graphs – 
Figure 2 and Figure 3. Figure 2 shows administrative, core 
and associated areas with their built-up and non-built-up 
area. Figure 3 represents built-up core area. Looking at the 
statistical evaluation presented in Figure 3, we can see that it 
was the area of production whose growth was the steepest in 
the core part. Comparing residential parts development, we 
can find that it covers larger areas with a steeper increase of 
size than those of traffic ones within the core region during 
last 20 years. However, there is a new highway passing the 
town in 5 km distance enabling the town to be used in 
prevailing part as a terminal location for the road traffic and 
not as a passing through town location. The town has not 
yield larger areas for recreation, leisure time, sport, etc., 
during last 40 years (Figure 3). 
The administration area has not changed since 1982. The 
core area changed - unlike most towns - between 1982 and 
1989. The residential area and area of production cover a 
similar part of the built-up area, however, the growth of the 
production area is steeper. Non built-up areas are in a 
prevailing part the forested ones. The associated areas are in 
most cases formed by an agricultural and forest land, 
however, their  sizes declineafter the 1989 political change . 
The spatial changes are described in the coincidence table 
(Table 1). Each row shows the size of an individual class 
and its transformation between 1950 and 2008. Each column 
comprises original areas forming the present size of an 
individual class. Areas without changes are highlighted in 
diagonal cells of the table.Comparing of the last row  (Sum 
2008) and last column  (Sum 1950) allows to find encrease 
and decrease of class areas.  
 
The road traffic intensity was checked both on local and 
higher level class roads. Both road types express a growth, 
however, mutually uncomparable. The slope of the growth 
is lower after 1995 when a new pass-by highway was built 
(Figure 4a). This phenomenon is presented as an impact of 
the highway construction out of the city on traffic intensity 
of the individual functional land use classes on Figure 4b.

on Figure 5. The city of Mělník has a very low number and 
growth of inhabitants in last 40 years if compared to 
Ostrava, e.g.; however, numbers of measured vehicles 
leaving and coming to both cities are similar. Mělník does 
not have any by-pass road and is situated on the direction 
among Prague and other important Czech cities. Analyzing 
Kolín and Hradec Králové, their traffic intensity and number 
of inhabitants show analogue situations.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
The 
project 
methodology 
is 
based 
on 
a 
multicorrelational processing using statistical (social, 
economical, geographical and natural) data of cities and 
spatial land use development and changes. There are more 
than six hundred economical, social and other statistical 
indicators whose mutual relation are prepared to be 
analyzed. The spatial development visualization can be 
usefully presented by coincidence table.  
Relations between town development and road traffic 
density showed interesting dependences. The traffic 
intensity changes cannot be generalized for a town as a unit. 
There are serious temporal changes within each town. These 
changes are caused by newly built commercial areas where 
this growth is incomparable to any other locations in the 
city, by new roads passing out of cities, e.g. The road traffic 
is also an important indicator of the economic inhabitant 
level – the traffic increase of personal and heavy- duty 
vehicles intensity on one side and decrease of motorcycle 
intensity and number of inhabitants on the other side since 
70-ies is a proof of the higher economical power of the city 
inhabitants which was found at all fifty analyzed cities.  
Results of any urban planning are always long lasting 
phenomena influencing the society. The spatial land use 
changes in 50 various cities will yield a rich source of data 
for the evaluation. The road traffic intensity is information 
on the air pollution, data on life expectancy are an issue 
concerning a social situation and health care, etc. The 
project results should offer a set of usable tools = indicators 
for urban planners and their further urban planning to 
achieve sustainable development of cities in the Czech 
Republic.  
The paper presents a very small analysis performed for 
functional classes and road traffic intensity. Spatial changes 
and their relation to the traffic evolution have already 
brought a great deal of information which will be processed 
in a form of one of indicators. The future research is focused 
on determining a list and sequence of indicators for the 
sustainable development of cities.
