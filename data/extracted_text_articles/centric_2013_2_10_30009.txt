Abstract— Detection of human respiration and heartbeat is an 
essential demand in medical monitoring, healthcare vigilance, 
as well as in rescue activities. Radar is an important tool to 
detect human respiration and heartbeat. Compared to body-
attached sensors, radar has the advantage of detection without 
contact to a subject, which is favorable in practical usage. We 
conducted preliminary studies on ultra-wideband (UWB) 
radar for detection of respiration and heartbeat by computer 
simulations in this paper. The main achievement of our work is 
the development of a UWB radar simulation system, which is 
designed in line with real implementation. Using the developed 
system, three UWB frequency bands are compared for 
respiration and heartbeat detection. The effects of using 
antenna arrays are also examined.

 INTRODUCTION 
Detection of human respiration and heartbeat is of 
essential importance in medical and healthcare services. 
Some examples are patient’s status tracking in medical 
triage, routine monitoring in elderly healthcare, searching of 
survivals under rubble of earthquake aftermath, and so on. 
Although respiration and heartbeat can be obtained by using 
body-attached 
sensors, 
detection 
without 
physical 
intervention to human body is much more comfort and 
convenient in practical usage. Radar is an important tool to 
detect human respiration and heartbeat without physical 
intervention to a subject. Researchers have been conducting 
studies on respiration and heartbeat detecting radars for 
decades. Some recent works can be found in [1-5, 8]. 
Doppler radar is often used for respiration and heartbeat 
detection [1-3]. In this case, the Doppler shift incurred by 
respiratory and circulatory contraction and expansion is 
measured by a continuous wave (CW) radar. Generally, the 
reflections and interference of surrounding scatters as well 
as interference between the respiration and heartbeat 
degrade the detection sensitivity. Using higher frequency is 
helpful to increase the detection sensitivity. L. Chioukh, et al. 
evaluated the effects of frequencies for 5.8 GHz, 24 GHz, 
and 35 GHz, and concluded that the highest sensitivity 
detection is achieved at the highest frequency [1].  
UWB radar for human tracking had been studied by 
several researchers [6-7]. Moreover, many authors had 
conducted studies on respiration and heartbeat detection 
using UWB radars. In [4], a pulse generator at the 
transmitter and a sampler at the receiver were used to detect 
respiration using UWB pulses at 0.5GHz - 2.5GHz. In [5], 
design issues for UWB radar at 3.1-10.6 GHz with 90nm 
CMOS were discussed. 
In this paper, we present preliminary results of UWB 
radars for detection of respiration and heartbeat by computer 
simulations. We developed a computer simulation system 
for UWB radar in line with real implementation. UWB 
bands are different in countries and regions, the developed 
radar simulation system mainly targets at the frequency 
bands that are allowed in Japan, while with the frequency 
band allowed in USA as comparison. Moreover, antenna 
array models are developed to investigate the effects of the 
number of antennas under the constraint of maximum total 
radiation limits.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, 
the developed simulation system of UWB radar and the 
detection principle are illustrated in detail. In Section III, the 
simulation setting and models are described. Then, examples 
of simulation results and discussions are presented in section 
IV. A short conclusion of the paper is given in Section V.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW 
The block diagram of the developed UWB radar system 
for simulation is shown in Figure 1. The clock generator 
generates strobe pulses with a frequency of fcg for 
synchronization of all modules in the system. In pseudo 
random (PN) dither module, strobe pulses are randomized in 
accordance with PN M-sequence. Each strobe pulse triggers 
a random PN number according to the law of M-sequence. 
Period of M-sequence in time unit is given by

where, NPN denotes the length of the M-sequence. Each 
strobe pulse arrived at PN dither will be delayed by a time 
interval that is linearly related to the PN numbers. The 
maximum delay corresponds to the maximum number of M-
sequence and it does not exceed the period of strobe pulse.

There 
are 
two 
main 
purposes 
to 
perform 
pulse 
randomization. Firstly, randomization can reduce the line 
spectrum components at frequencies that are multiples of 
clock frequency fcg. Secondly, randomization makes the 
signal spectrum more noise-like, which is favourable for 
better electromagnetic compatibility and for achieving 
efficient usage of power spectral density. Finally, the PN 
dither outputs randomized pulse sequence, whose repetition 
period is equal to TPN. 
After PN dither, the randomized pulse sequence is 
divided into two equivalent parts. On one hand, the first part 
is sent to pulse former (1) to generate UWB pulse for 
emission. On the other hand, the second part is passed 
through a variable delay module and sent to pulse former (2) 
to generate a heterodyne signal for signal detection at the 
receiver. At pulse former (1), randomized pulse sequence is 
modulated by an IF former. The latter operates on the clock 
frequency fcg and generates periodic square signal with a 
period of 2TPN. Therefore, pulse former (1) is switched on 
during the first TPN interval and outputs the randomized 
pulse sequence.  Pulse former (1) is switched off during the 
second TPN interval without outputs. Another role of the IF 
former is that it enables the use of bandpass amplifier 
working at intermediate frequency at receiver. That 
eliminates the flicker noise in the amplification of the 
received signals. In contrast, pulse former (2) outputs a 
delayed version of randomized pulse sequence continuously.  
Pulse burst from pulse former (1) is sent to the transmit 
antenna array (TX array). At TX array, input signal is 
divided and fed into every element. Each element of the TX 
array contains an adjustable delay unit (ADU), a variable 
gain amplifier (VGA), and an antenna. The ADUs can be 
used to coordinate delays among antennas.  After delay and 
amplification, UWB pulses are emitted towards subject. The 
numbers of array antennas enabled in the simulation system 
are 11, 22, and 44, respectively.  
The emitted UWB signal is reflected by the subject. A 
sequence of reflected pulses is received by the receive 
antenna array (Rx array). Each element of the RX array 
contains an antenna, a VGA, and an ADU. ADUs are used 
to coordinate delays among receiving antennas. The 
received signals from all elements are added and fed into the 
mixer, where the received signal is demodulated using the 
heterodyne signal from pulse former (2). The output of the 
Mixer is passed to the integrator. 
If the received signal matches with the heterodyne signal, 
the integrator outputs correlated signal, which strength is 
proportional to the amplitude of the received signal with the 
period of 2  TPN. By taking advantage of the huge 
bandwidth of UWB, we use a range-gated architecture with 
a basic sensing resolution element of dR.

where c is speed of light and dt is the UWB pulse length 
measured at -10 dB level. The latter varies in accordance 
with frequencies and bandwidths. We can detect a number 
of NdR resolution elements by sequentially sending NdR of 
pulse bursts and adjusting variable delay for pulse former 2, 
so that each pulse burst corresponds to one out of the NdR 
elements.  
Then, the signal is amplified by VGA to compensate 
signal attenuation due to reflection and transmission. Finally, 
the signal is filtered by BPF and passed through analogue 
digital converter (ADC) and then fed into the digital signal 
processing (DSP) unit. The sampling frequency is same as 
the clock frequency fcg. 
The structure of DSP is shown in Figure 2. In amplitude 
detector module, the input signal is divided into in-phase 
and quadrature-phase components and converted into 
baseband signal. Square root samples of envelope of the 
baseband signal are calculated for each resolution element. 
The obtained envelope samples are sent to the bin 
decimation module, where decimation is performed while 
keeping the resulted sampling frequency large enough to 
recover the targeting objective.   
The signal reflected from stationary objects, repeats in 
each sweep and presents as DC component in each 
resolution element. Infinite impulse response (IIR) filter of 
the first order is applied as Bin DC filter to remove the DC 
component and to output realizations of samples. In the 
cyclic buffer module, a number of NFFT counts of 
realizations are stored for each of the NdR resolution element.

When the buffer is full of NFFT counts, a new incoming 
count will drive out the oldest count so that the buffer is 
continuously updated. Then, Bin FFT module performs 
sequentially moving fast Fourier transform (FFT) with pre-
weighting by windowing function. A weighted realization

Finally, the resulted spectral samples are sent to target 
detectors. In which, corresponding spectral components of 
respiration and heartbeat are tuned. The maximum value is 
chosen from the tuned spectral components, which is 
compared with a threshold. If the spectral component is 
larger than the threshold, the corresponding subject is 
detected.

SIMULATION SETTING 
In this section, we describe the assumptions and 
conditions that are used to carry out simulations with the 
developed UWB radar system. We first show the frequency 
bands examined, which affect the UWB pulses directly. 
Then, parameters related to radar as well as parameters of 
subject to be detected are illustrated. 
A. Frequency Bands 
The available UWB bands are different in countries or 
regions. In the developed simulation system, we mainly 
investigate the following three frequency bands.  
(1) 3.4 - 4.8 GHz 
(2) 7.25 – 10.25 GHz 
(3) 3.1 -10.6 GHz 
where, (1) and (2) are UWB low band and high band 
regulated in Japan, while (3) is UWB band regulated in 
USA. The reason that we select both low band and high 
band of Japan is that low band will be impelled to more 
strict regulation, although low frequency is suitable for radar 
in general. A UWB pulse can be expressed as

where, fc is the center frequency of the corresponding band, 
a is a pulse parameter and is dependent on UWB band. Amax 
is the maximum amplitude, which is restricted by 
regulations and is also dependent on UWB band. For the 
above three UWB bands and different antenna arrays, these 
parameters are summarized in Table I.

B. Detection Setting 
As shown in Figure 3, the radar is located at the ceiling of 
a room. In our simulation system, omni antennas are 
assumed. When 2 2 or 4 4 antenna array are used, the 
neighbour antennas are separated by a distance of λ/2, 
where λ is the wave length at the center frequency of the 
UWB band. The body skin vibration caused by respiration

and heartbeat is combination of respiration signal RP(t) and 
heartbeat signal HB(t). Suppose that the radar is put in a 
position right above the subject as shown in Figure 3, the 
skin vibration caused by respiration and heartbeat will only

reflection area of the target is assigned with values of 20 cm2 
for respiration and 3 cm2 for heart beat respectively. The 
antenna gain Gt and Gr are both set to 0 dBi and the transmit 
power Pt is decided by the allowed UWB power spectrum 
density (PSD) and bandwidth. The wave length λ is 
calculated at the center frequency of a given UWB band. 
Furthermore, thermal noise is assumed with a one-sided 
power spectral density N0.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In the following, we show some examples of the 
computer simulation results. Our main concern is put on the 
examination on the three UWB bands as well as the 
examination on numbers of antennas. In the developed 
simulation system, GUI is installed so that one can 
intuitively observe the detection of a subject. Graphics in 
both frequency domain and time domain are shown 
simultaneously through GUI. 
Examples of respiration and heartbeat detections on GUI 
are given in Figures 4 and 5 respectively. In Figure 4, an 
example of respiration detection using 3.4-4.8 GHz band and 
with 2 2 antenna array is shown. It can be seen that the 
respiration frequency is clearly detected at 0.4 Hz, although a 
small component appears at the two-time harmonic in the

frequency domain. In the time domain, the period of the 
respiration can be clearly recognized, which is about 2.5s. 
An example of heartbeat detection using 7.25-10.25 GHz 
band and with 44 antenna array is shown in Figure 5. The 
heartbeat is detected at 1.2 Hz in frequency domain and the 
period of heartbeat obtained in time domain is about 0.83s. 
In Figure 6, required gains of the VGA that is located 
after the integrator are obtained. The detection target is 
respiration and the distance between the subject and radar 
antenna is fixed at 3m. For comparison convenience, the 
results are normalized to that of the 11 antenna case on 
3.1-10.6 GHz band. Evaluation and comparison among the 
three frequency bands as well as the three patterns of array 
antennas are made. 
It can be seen that for all three frequency bands, 
increasing the number of antenna can steadily reduce the 
required VGA gains. Compared to 11 antenna, 22 array 
saves 9-10 dB gains, while 44 array further saves another 
9-10 dB gains compared to 2 2 array. For each case of 
antenna array, we give two results which correspond to two 
detection status. The results show that 3.4-4.8 GHz band 
and 7.25-10.25 GHz band present similar detection ability. 
In comparison, 3.1-10.6 GHz band can save 3-4 dB gains 
than the other twos. The reason that 3.4-4.8 GHz band and 
7.25-10.25 GHz band give similar results can be explained 
as follows. On one hand, the center frequency of 3.4-4.8 
GHz band is slightly less than half of that of 7.25-10.25 
GHz band. On the other hand, 7.25-10.25 GHz band has a 
slightly larger bandwidth than double that of 3.4-4.8 GHz 
band. The merit provided by the low center frequency is 
waived by the merit of large bandwidth. 
Next, we investigate the maximum distance for heartbeat 
detection for the three UWB bands. To make fair 
comparisons, in each frequency band and for each antenna 
combination we increase the maximum VGA gains as large 
as possible until ADC clipping occurs. The obtained results 
are summarized in Figure 7. It can be seen that when 3.4-4.8 
GHz band and 7.25-10.25 GHz band are used, there is not 
big difference on maximum distance. However, when 3.1-
10.6 GHz band is used, the detecting distance is increased. 
Moreover, increasing the number of antennas results in large 
detecting distance. In Figure 7, using 3.1-10.6 GHz band 
with 4  4 array, the heartbeat can be detected from a 
distance of 3.4 m. 
Finally, using heartbeat detection as an example, the 
relation of detecting distance with required gain are depicted 
in Figure 8. All three UWB band are investigated with 44 
array and 22 array, respectively. The results for 22 array 
are shown with blank symbols while the results for 44 are 
shown with filled symbols. It can be seen that for each 
combination among the three UWB bands and two types of 
antenna arrays, the required gain almost linearly increases 
with detecting distance. The inclinations of increase for all 
cases are very similar. Except for a single point at 1m, 3.1-
10.6 GHz band needs less gain than the other two bands. It is 
also obvious that 44 array presents constant gain against 
2 2 array. The gain is around 8-11dB. This number also 
coincides with the result of respiration detection given in 
Figure 6, in which the gain obtained by 44 array over that 
of 2 2 array is 9-10 dB. Thus, it is an effective way to 
increase the radar detectability by increasing antennas.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
We conducted preliminary studies on UWB radar with 
antenna arrays for detection of human respiration and 
heartbeat. A computer simulation radar system is developed 
in line with the structure and processing of real radar systems. 
We also installed a GUI so that the detection of respiration 
and heartbeat can be shown intuitively. 
As our goal is to develop a UWB radar system within the 
scope of regulation in Japan, the regulated UWB low band, 
3.4-4.8 GHz, and UWB high band, 7.25-10.25 GHz, of Japan 
are investigated. The regulated USA UWB band, 3.1-10.6 
GHz is presented as a comparison. Three types of antenna 
combinations, 1 1, 2 2, and 4 4, are also investigated.  
The simulation results show that UWB low band and UWB 
high band of Japan present identical detection performance. 
Both of them are a little deteriorated by the 3.1-10.6 GHz 
band. However, if the subject is under rubble, 3.4-4.8 GHz 
band should be superior because it can go through rubble 
more easily than the latter. Our results show that increasing 
antenna is an effective way to enhance detection ability.
