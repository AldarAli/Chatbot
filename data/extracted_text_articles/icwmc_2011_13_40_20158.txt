Abstract—Interference between two RAT (Radio Access 
Technology) wireless networks will lead to the system capacity 
deduction. In this paper, system capacity loss was analyzed by 
using snapshot method and the simulation results show that 
system capacity loss is closely related to the relative offset and 
antenna direction between two RAT wireless networks. Based 
on the interference analysis above, a novel wireless 
architecture was proposed by rotating antenna direction and 
adjusting offset between two RAT wireless networks. 
Simulation results verified that it can effectively avoid system 
interference.

 INTRODUCTION  
Long Term Evolution (LTE) is designed to reduce 
latency, improve capacity and coverage, and enhance Quality 
of user Experience (QoE) [1]. However, there will be the 
scenario of coexistence of LTE network and other RAT 
(Radio Access Technology) wireless networks due to the 
huge cost of network building and scarce frequency resource 
[2]. Previous works have focused on analysis of system 
interference in two wireless networks coexistence, the 
problem of wireless network layout influencing system 
performance still remains open [3-7]. So, it is essential to 
analyze interference between two wireless networks and 
explore wireless network architecture to reduce interference.  
There are two kinds of interference analysis methods, 
analytical method and simulation method. Analytical method 
requires an accurate mathematical model abstracted from 
system level behavior of wireless network. Interference 
could be analyzed by mathematical derivation. The 
simulation method is a snapshot method developed from 
Monte Carlo method [9]. By establishing the system 
simulation platform, randomizing user’s parameters such as 
position, speed, wireless channel state and running program 
periodically, statistics could be obtained in a cyclic snapshot 
way for interference analysis.     
As it is difficult to get an accurate mathematical model 
for CDMA 2000 1xEVDO and LTE coexistence scenario, 
snapshot simulation method could be considered as a proper 
way for interference analysis. One simulation procedure 
including several snapshots of LTE system is described as in 
Figure 1.   
Figure 1. Basic process of snapshot method.  
 
One simulation process is composed of n independent 
snapshots and each snapshot includes m continues TTIs 
(Transmission Time Interval). Simulation results of each 
snapshot are stored and the system performance can be 
obtained by averaging the stored results.   
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, interferences in two wireless networks coexistence 
scenario are briefly described. In Section III, simulation 
platform is introduced and simulation results were shown. A 
new wireless network architecture is proposed and verified in 
Section IV. Section V concludes the work.

 This section describes interference types in coexistence 
of wireless networks of CDMA 2000 1x EVDO and LTE 
systems.

Figure 2(a) shows a one cell model for the wireless 
network architecture of three sector antenna. A cell is 
composed of three sectors represented as regular hexagon.   
Figure 2(b) shows the coexistence of wireless networks 
architecture. As it can be seen, the LTE network is depicted 
in dashed line and CDMA 2000 1x EVDO is in solid line.      
The network architecture of two systems is the same such 
as cell radius, antenna direction. But, there is a position 
offset between LTE and EVDO wireless network. The offset 
direction is depicted by a dotted line. The maximum of 
offset is 
3R
, where R is cell radius as shown in Figure 
2(b). After normalization of offset, offset’s range is from 0 
to 1, where 1 presents the maximum offset 
3R
and 0 
indicates no offset between EVDO and LTE network 
architecture.    
B.  Interference types    
Interference includes inter-cell interference and adjacent 
channel interference. Inter-cell interference is caused by 
inter-cell users which share the same frequency with victim 
user. Adjacent channel interference is mainly composed of 
adjacent channel leakage and adjacent channel selectivity 
[10]. Scenario of CDMA2000 1x EVDO AT interfering LTE 
eNB can be described as Figure 3 and interference to 
downlink is the same.

LTE eNB in the center presents the serving station

data to this serving eNB which is interfered by inter-cell 
interference and inter-system interference. In addition, black 
solid line denotes interference from inter cell LTE User 
equipments (UE) and dashed line represents adjacent channel 
interference from EVDO system. The SINR (signal 
interference noise ration) of signal received by serving eNB 
can be calculated as following.

INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS BY SNAPSHOT   
A.  Simulation Platform   
The simulation platform is established according to 3GPP 
and 3GPP2 specifications [10-12].  When calculating inter-
system interference, the simulation time period of EVDO 
sub-frame length (20/3 ms) has to be aligned to LTE system 
TTI (1ms). Figure 5 represents the process of time alignment.  
After time alignment, EVDO transmitting power during 1 ms 
remains unchanged.     
Figure 6 shows the flowchart of snapshot process 
including initial layout of coexistence networks and 
procedure of each snapshot. A TTI process is composed of 
modeling the channel fading of LTE and EVDO system, 
scheduling (or rate controlling), calculating mean SINR of 
receiving signal  considering interference signal power from 
the other system, and storing the system throughput of 
current TTI through link level interface.

Figure 7. Downlink sector capacity loss.  
 
From each figure, we can find a common phenomenon 
that downlink capacity loss while offset=0 is more serious 
than the other two offset situations.   
Comparing two figures above, EVDO is much easier to 
be interfered than LTE. As mentioned on parameter tables 
291

in Section II, LTE is working on a wider band than EVDO 
and both systems are working on the adjacent channels. The 
LTE leakage power to the adjacent channel is so wider in 
frequency domain that it covers EVDO working band totally. 
Quite different, the power leakage of EVDO in frequency 
domain could only cover a small part of LTE working band. 
As a result, EVDO downlink is much more vulnerable than 
LTE when interfering with each other.  
In order to limit capacity loss which should be less than 
5% for example, the ACIR of LTE system should be larger 
than 32.5dB, 31dB, 31.5dB when offset is 0, 0.5, 1 
respectively. For EVDO system, the ACIR should be larger 
than 34dB, 35dB, 32.5dB when offset is 0, 0.5, 1 
respectively.

The result shows that uplink capacity loss is the most 
serious when offset=1 among three offsets. After comparing 
Figure 8(a) with Figure 8(b), we can find that EVDO uplink 
is easy to be interfered than LTE. The reason is similar to 
downlink case.   
In order to confine capacity loss within 5% for example, 
the ACIR of LTE should be larger than 15dB, 22dB, 25dB 
when offset is 0, 0.5, 1 respectively. For EVDO system, the 
ACIR should be larger than 21dB, 33dB, 39dB when offset 
is 0, 0.5, 1 respectively.   
IV. 
A NEW WIRELESS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE   
In order to reduce the system interference as described 
above, a new wireless network architecture is proposed, 
which is different from that presented in 3GPP specification 
[10]. This wireless architecture is shown in Figure 9.   
 
Figure 9. Definition of offset and antenna rotation. 
 
In Figure 9, solid line denotes LTE cell and dashed line 
means EVDO cell. Comparing to traditional network 
architecture in Section 2, the antenna of LTE rotates theta = 
60 degrees and other parameters remain unchanged. The 
offset remains the same definition as defined in Section 2. In 
order to compare with system performance in traditional 
architecture, simulation results of capacity loss are shown in 
the same figure. Theta=0 represents traditional network 
architecture, while theta=60 represents new coexistence 
architecture. The result is shown as follows.   
A. Downlink  
In the new architecture scenario, downlink capacity 
loss of LTE and EVDO are shown in Figure 10(a) and 
Figure 10(b). The results show that system capacity loss 
under new coexistence architecture is reduced comparing to 
the system performance under traditional architecture when 
the offset is fixed. To confine capacity loss within 5% under 
the new architecture, ACIR of LTE should be larger than 
30dB, 29dB and 27.5dB when offset is 0, 0.5 and 1 
respectively. On the other hand, ACIR of EVDO should 
meet the minimum requirements of 36.75dB, 35.5dB and 
35dB when offset is 0, 0.5 and 1 respectively.

(b) EVDO uplink capacity loss 
Figure 11.  Uplink sector capacity loss. 
 
To confine capacity loss within 5% under the new 
architecture, ACIR of LTE should be larger than 19.5dB, 
31.5dB and 40dB when offset is 0, 0.5 and 1 respectively. 
On the other hand, ACIR of EVDO should meet the 
minimum requirements of 15dB, 24.5dB when offset is 0 
and 1 respectively. The result shows that under the new 
architecture, uplink capacity loss is reduced comparing to 
traditional wireless network architecture.     
V. 
CONCLUSION 
 In the paper, system performance of LTE and EVDO 
under different wireless architecture was analyzed by 
snapshot simulation method. The simulation results show 
that with increasing offset between two RAT wireless 
networks, downlink capacity loss is decreased while uplink 
capacity loss is increased. After rotating antenna direction, 
interference is relieved in downlink and uplink. Furthermore, 
comparing to rotating antenna direction of each wireless 
networks node, adjusting offset between two RAT wireless 
networks is more effective to reduce inter system 
interference.
