I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, more and more multimedia applications 
integrate 
wireless 
transmission 
functionalities. 
Wireless 
networks are suitable for those types of applications, due to 
their ease of deployment and because they yield tremendous 
advantages in terms of mobility of User Equipment (UE). 
However, wireless networks are subject to a high level of 
transmission errors because they rely on radio waves whose 
characteristics are highly dependent of the transmission 
environment. 
 In wireless video transmission applications like the one 
considered in this paper and presented in Figure 1, effective 
data protection is a crucial issue. 
 
JPEG 2000, the newest image representation standard, 
addresses this issue firstly by including predefined error 
resilient tools in his core encoding system (part 1)  and going 
straightforward by defining in its 11th part called wireless JPEG 
2000 ( JPWL) a set of error resilient techniques to improve the 
transmission of JPEG 2000 codestreams over error-prone 
wireless channel

II. OVERVIEW OF JPEG 2000 AND WIRELESS 
JPEG 2000 
A. JPEG 2000  
JPEG 2000 is the newest image compression standard 
completing the existing JPEG standard  [1]. 
The interest for JPEG 2000 is growing since the Digital 
Cinema Initiatives (DCI) has selected JPEG 2000 for future 
distribution of motion pictures.  
Its main characteristics are: lossy or lossless compression 
modes; resolution, quality and spatial scalability; transmission 
and progressive image reconstruction; error resilience for low 
bit rate mobile applications; Region Of Interest (ROI) 
functionality, etc. 
Part 1 of the standard defines different tools allowing the 
decoder to detect errors in the transmitted codestream, to select 
the erroneous part of the code and to synchronise the decoder 
in order to avoid decoder crash. Even if those tools give a 
certain level of protection from transmission errors, they 
become ineffective when the transmission channel experiment 
high bit error rate. Wireless JPEG 2000 (JPEG 2000 11th part) 
addressed this issue by defining techniques to make JPEG 2000 
codestream more resilient to transmissions errors in wireless 
systems.  
 
B. Wireless JPEG 2000 (JPWL)  
Wireless JPEG (JPWL) specifies error resilience tools such 
as Forward Error correction (FEC), interleaving, unequal error 
protection. 
In this paper we present a wireless JPEG 2000 video 
streaming system based on the recommendations of JPWL final 
draft  [2]. 
In  [3], the description of the JPWL system is presented and 
the performance of its Error Protection Block (EPB) is 
evaluated. A fully JPEG 2000 Part 1 compliant backward 
compatible error protection scheme is proposed in  [4]. A 
memoryless Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) is used for 
simulations both in  [4] and  [3]. However, as packets errors 
mainly occur in bursts, the channel model considered in those 
works is not realistic. Moreover JPEG 2000 codestreams 
interleaving is not considered in  [4].  
In this paper we address the problem of robust and efficient 
JPEG 2000 images and video transmission over wireless 
networks. The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we

present a state of art of wireless JPEG 2000 multimedia 
communication systems along with the challenges to overcome 
in terms of codestreams protection against transmission errors. 
In section III, we provide an overview of channel coding 
techniques for efficient JPEG 2000 based multimedia 
networking. Finally section IV, provides discussions and 
prospective issues for future distribution of motion JPEG 2000 
images and video over wireless networks. 
 
III. WIRELESS JPEG 2000 MULTIMEDIA 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND ITS CHALLENGES   
 
In high error rate environments such as wireless channels, 
data protection is mandatory for efficient transmission of 
images and video. In this context, Wireless JPEG 2000 the 11th 
part of JPEG 2000  [2] uses different techniques such as data 
interleaving, Forward Error Correction (FEC) with Reed-
Solomon (RS) codes etc. in order to enhance the protection of 
JPEG 2000 codestreams against transmission errors.    
In wireless multimedia system such as the one considered 
in this paper (see Figure 1), a straightforward FEC 
methodology is applying FEC uniformly over the entire stream 
(Equal Error Correction - EEP). However, for hierarchical 
codes such as JPEG 2000, Unequal Error  
Protection (UEP) which assigns different FEC to different 
portion of codestream has been considered as a suitable 
protection scheme.  
Since wireless channels' characteristics depend on the 
transmission environment, the packet loss rate in the system 
also changes dynamically. Thus a priori FEC rate allocation 
schemes such as the one proposed in  [5] are less efficient. Two 
families of data protection schemes address this issue by taking 
the wireless channel characteristics into account in order to 
dynamically assign the FEC rate for JPEG 2000 based 
images/video. The first family is based on a dynamic layer-
oriented unequal error protection methodology whereas the 
second relies on a dynamic packet-oriented unequal error 
protection methodology. Hence, in the first case, powerful RS 
codes are assigned to most important layers and less robust 
codes are used for the protection of less important layers. It is 
worth noting that in this case, all the JPEG 2000 packets 
belonging to the same layer are protected with the same 
selected RS code. Examples of layer-oriented FEC rate 
allocation schemes are available in  [6] and  [7]. On the other 
side, in packet-oriented FEC rate allocation schemes such as 
the one presented in  [7], RS codes are assigned by decreasing 
order of packets importance. In  [7], we demonstrate that the 
proposed optimal packet-oriented FEC rate allocation is more 
efficient than the layer-oriented FEC rate allocation scheme 
presented in  [6] and  [7]. However, layer-based FEC rate 
allocation schemes have low complexity while packet-oriented 
FEC allocation methodologies are complex especially when the 
number of packets in the codestream is high. In this case, 
packet oriented FEC schemes are unpractical for highly time-
constrained images/video streaming applications. In this case 
switching to a layer oriented FEC rate allocation scheme is 
more interesting.  
 
The smart FEC rate allocation scheme 
proposed in  [9] address this issue by allowing switching from a 
packet oriented FEC scheme to a layer oriented scheme such as 
the ones proposed in  [10].  
 
In section III.A we present the packet oriented system 
proposed in  [7] to address the issue of robust JPEG 2000 
images and video transmission over wireless network. Then in 
section III.B the layer-oriented scheme proposed in  [10] is 
described. Finally, in section III.C we present the system 
proposed in  [9] to unify packet and layer based scheme. 
 
A.  Optimal Packet-oriented FEC rate allocation scheme for 
robust Wireless JPEG 2000 based multimedia 
transmission 
 
The functionalities of the proposed JPWL packet-oriented 
system are presented in Figure 2 The aim of this system is to 
efficiently transmit a Motion JPEG 2000 (MJ2) video sequence 
through MANET channel traces. 
 
The system is described as follows: 
 The input of the JPWL codec is a Motion JPEG 2000 
(MJ2) file. The JPEG 2000 codestreams included in the MJ2 
file are extracted and indexed.  
These indexed codestreams are transmitted to the JPWL 
encoder ( [2] presents a more accurate description of the used 
JPWL encoder) which applies FEC at the specified rate and 
adds the JPWL markers in order to make the codestream 
compliant to Wireless JPEG 2000 standard. At this stage, 
frames are still JPEG 2000 part 1 compliant, which means that 
any JPEG 2000 decoder is able to decode them.  
To increase JPWL frames robustness, an interleaving 
mechanism is processed before each frame transmission 
through the error-prone channel. This is a recommended 
mechanism for transmission over wireless channel where errors 
occur in burst (contiguous long sequence of errors). Thanks to 
interleaving the correlation between error sequences is reduced. 
The interleaving step is followed by RTP packetization. In 
this process, JPEG 2000 codestream data and other types of 
data are integrated into RTP packets as described in  [11].

RTP packets are then transmitted through the wireless 
channel which is modelled in this work by a Gilbert channel 
model. At the decoder side, after depacketization, the JPWL 
decoder corrects and decodes the received JPWL codestreams 
and rebuilds the JPEG 2000 frames. At this stage, parameters 
such as Packet Error Rate ( PER ) are extracted, increasing the 
knowledge of the channel state. The decoder sends extracted 
parameters back to the JPWL encoder via the Up link. The last 
process of the transmission chain is the comparison between 
the transmitted and the decoded image/video. Figure 3 presents 
JPEG 2000 codestreams transmission through the JPWL 
packet-oriented FEC system

B. Optimal Layer-oriented FEC rate allocation scheme for 
robust Wireless JPEG 2000 based multimedia 
transmission 
Unlike the system described in  [7], where the FEC rate 
allocation scheme is packet oriented, in the current system we 
consider a layer oriented FEC rate allocation scheme. In other 
words the difference between both systems is the FEC rate 
allocation module. Actually, in the packet oriented scheme the 
redundancy is added by taking the packets importance into 
account (see Figure 3) while in the layer oriented scheme we 
rely on layers importance to allocate the adequate RS codes 
(see Figure 4).

C. Smart combined Packet/layer based FEC rate allocation 
scheme for robust Wireless JPEG 2000 based multimedia 
transmission 
The functionalities of the proposed smart JPWL based 
system are presented in Figure 5. 
In this system, indexed JPEG 2000 codestreams are 
transmitted to the smart FEC rate allocation module. If the 
number of data packets available in the codestreams is low 
(typically under the defined smart threshold), the smart module 
uses the optimal packet-oriented FEC rate allocation 
methodology presented in  [7] whereas it switches to the 
dynamic layer-oriented FEC rate allocation methodology 
presented in  [10]  when the number of data packets is high. 
Ones the protection rate determined, the codestreams are 
transmitted to the JPWL encoder which applies FEC at the 
specified rate and adds the JPWL markers in order to make the 
codestream compliant to Wireless JPEG 2000 standard. Hence, 
Figures 3 and 4 correspond to the JPWL protection where 
redundant data are added to original codestreams. If the JPEG 
2000 Frame which is being processed is constituted by less 
than a defined threshold (smart_thresh) , then the smart FEC 
rate allocation scheme emulates a scenario similar to the one 
presented in Figure 3 (packet-oriented FEC rate allocation). 
Otherwise, it emulates the scenario of Figure 4 (dynamic layer-
oriented FEC rate allocation). Protected data are then 
interleaved and transmitted.

system 
 
The interest of the smart FEC rate allocation scheme is to 
allow switching from the scenario presented in Figure 3 to the 
scenario described in Figure 4, reducing by this way the 
complexity of the FEC rate allocation process. Hence, in case 
of highly layered images/video streaming, the time needed to 
select the suited FEC rate is significantly reduced. In the 
following section we present the packet-oriented and layer-
oriented algorithm considered in this paper.  
 
 
IV. RESULTS 
A.   Performance of layer based FEC scheme in terms of 
time consumption 
In Figure 6 the run time of the proposed layer based FEC 
rate allocation scheme is plotted versus the number of data 
packets available in the JPEG 2000 codestreams. This curve is 
compared to the one achieved using the optimal packet oriented 
FEC rate allocation scheme  [7]. These results are achieved 
using an Intel core Duo CPU 2.9 Ghz Workstation. 
As packet-oriented and layer oriented schemes are linked 
by the number of layers available in each image, we vary this 
parameter in order to derive some comparable results.  In the 
considered scenario, the number of available resolution and 
component of JPEG 2000 frames are fixed (resolution = 10 and 
component = 1) because these parameters do not impact the 
time-performance of layer oriented FEC rate allocation 
schemes.  In Figure 6 each packet (i) corresponds to a specific 
JPEG 2000 frame (with a specific quality layer). 
 In this scenario, the available bandwidth in the system is 
set to 18 Mbits/s (
Mbits s
Bav
/
=18
). It is worth noting that in 
practice few existing JPEG 2000 codecs allow high quality 
scalability and to our knowledge, none of them can handle 
more than 50 quality layers. Hence, the considered scenario 
allows generalization to future high quality layer scalable FEC 
rate allocation systems. 
In Figure 6 we notice that both layer and packet oriented 
scheme have a run time linearly increasing with the number of 
packets available in the codestreams. However, the optimal 
layer based FEC scheme is significantly less time consuming 
than the packet based FEC scheme. For codestreams containing 
less than 1000 packets (quality layers ≤  10) the packet 
oriented FEC scheme is 3 times more time consuming than our 
optimal layer based FEC scheme. For JPEG 2000 codestreams, 
whose number of packets is between 1000 and 5000 (quality 
layers between 10 and 50) the packet oriented scheme is up to 5 
times the run time of the layer based FEC scheme. Since 
existing JPEG 2000 codecs handle less than 50 quality layers, 
our proposed optimal layer based scheme is a good candidate 
for real-time JPEG 2000 codestreams over wireless channel as 
its yields low time consumption.

The proposed optimal layer based scheme, due to its low 
time consumption, could be viewed as a good candidate for 
future high quality layer scalable wireless JPEG 2000 based 
images and video streaming applications.

Although the layer 
based scheme 
achieves 
good 
performances in terms of time consumption in comparison to 
packet oriented FEC rate allocation schemes, the last ones 
present better performance in terms of visualization quality 
especially for highly noisy channels. In the following section 
we demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal layer based 
FEC scheme thanks to a client/server application of Motion 
JPEG 2000 video streaming over real ad-hoc network traces. 
 
B. Packet-oriented and Layer-oriented FEC rate allocation 
for Motion  JPEG 2000 video streaming  over real ad-hoc 
network traces  
In this section we present the results achieved while 
streaming Motion JPEG 2000 based video over real ad-hoc 
network channel traces  [13] [13] and we demonstrate that the 
proposed optimal layer based scheme outperforms existing 
layer oriented FEC schemes even if for highly noisy channel it 
is less efficient than packet oriented FEC scheme. The 
comparison is handled both in terms of Structural Similarity 
(SSIM)  [14] and in terms of successful decoding rate. We 
derive the Mean SSIM metric of the Motion JPEG 2000 video 
sequence by averaging the SSIM metrics of the JPEG 2000 
images contained on the considered video sequence. It is worth 
noting that each SSIM measure derived is associated to a 
successful decoding rate metric which corresponds to decoder 
crash avoidance on the basis of 1000 transmission trials.  
 
The considered wireless channel traces are available in  [13]  
and the video sequence used is speedway.mj2  [12]  containing 
200 JPEG 2000 frames generated with an overall compression 
ratio of 20 for the base layer, 10 for the second layer and 5 for 
the third layer. Figure 7 presents the successful decoding rate 
of the motion JPEG 2000 video sequence speedway.mj2  [12] 
transmission over real ad-hoc network channel traces  [13]. We 
observe that for highly noisy channels (
dB
C N
15
/
≤
), the 
proposed optimal layer outperforms other layer based FEC 
schemes but is less efficient than the packet oriented scheme. 
For noisy channel (
dB
C N

18
/

≤
≤
), we notice that all 
layer based UEP schemes exhibit similar performances in 
terms of successful decoding rate.  
For low noisy channel (

C N
18
/
≥
) all the FEC schemes 
yield the same improvement in terms of successful decoding 
rate.  
 
Fig.7 Successful decoding rate versus Carrier to Noise 
Ratio  
 
 
In Figure 8 we show that our proposed optimal layer based 
FEC rate allocation scheme still outperforms other layer based 
schemes in terms of Mean SSIM. This is due to the fact that the 
base layer which is the most important part of the codestreams 
is highly protected in our proposed scheme, in comparison to 
other layer based schemes, guaranteeing this way a good 
quality for the visualization.

V. CONCLUSION AND OPEN ISSUE : SCALABLE   
JPEG 2000 TRANSMISSION  
Many problems are still to be addressed in the framework 
of JPEG 2000 codestreams transmission over wireless 
networks. Image scalability based on dynamic available 
bandwidth estimation is one of those problems. In the 
literature, proposed image scalable systems have been 
implemented using a fixed available bandwidth in their 
considered scenarios  [15],  [16]. This assumption is no longer 
true in wireless systems because they rely on radio waves 
whose characteristics depend on the transmission environment. 
Moreover, 
few 
of 
the 
proposed 
systems 
addressed 
simultaneously the bandwidth estimation problem and the issue 
of smoothness for JPEG 2000 codestreams scalability. In  [17], 
we addresses both issues by proposing a scalable and non 
aggressive wireless JPEG 2000 image and video transmission 
algorithm based on a dynamic bandwidth estimation tool.  
The main limitation of the scalable system proposed in  [17] 
is that it handles only one wireless client. However, this 
limitation could be overcome by generalizing the proposed 
algorithm to multiple wireless clients’ scenario. We propose a 
framework for this generalization which opens the path for 
efficient wireless JPEG 2000 codestreams transmission in Next 
Generation Networks which are characterize by the cohabitation 
of multiples wireless devices having different standards 
requirements and different capacities.
