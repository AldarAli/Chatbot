Abstract— The purpose of this paper is the design of simple 
combinational optoelectronic circuit based on SiC technology, 
able to act simultaneously as a 4-bit binary encoder or a binary 
decoder in a 4-to-16 line configurations. The 4-bit binary 
encoder takes all the data inputs, one by one, and converts 
them to a single encoded output. The binary decoder decodes a 
binary input pattern to a decimal output code. The 
optoelectronic circuit is realized using a a-SiC:H double 
pin/pin photodetector with two front and back optical gates 
activated trough steady state violet background. Four red, 
green, blue and violet input channels impinge on the device at 
different bit sequences allowing 16 possible inputs. The device 
selects, through the violet background, one of the sixteen 
possible input logic signals and sends it to the output. Results 
show that the device acts as a reconfigurable active filter and 
allows optical switching and optoelectronic logic functions 
development. A relationship between the optical inputs and the 
corresponding digital output levels is established.  A binary 
color weighted code that takes into account the specific weights 
assigned to each bit position establish the optoelectronic 
functions. A truth table of an encoder that performs 16-to-1 
multiplexer (MUX) function is presented.

INTRODUCTION  
There has been much research on semiconductor 
devices as elements for optical communication, when a band 
or frequency needs to be filtered from a wider range of 
mixed signals or when optical active filter are used to select 
and filter input signals to specific output ports in WDM 
communication systems [1, 2]. 
Optical communication in the visible spectrum usually 
interfaces with an optoelectric device for further signal 
processing. Multilayered structures based on amorphous 
silicon technology are expected to become reconfigurable to 
perform WDM optoelectronic logic functions [3, 4]. They 
will be a solution in WDM technique for information 
transmission and decoding in the visible range [5]. The 
basic operating principle is the exploitation of the physical 
properties of a nonlinear element to perform a logic 
function, with the potential to be rapidly biasing tuned Any 
change in any of these factors will result in filter 
readjustments. Here, signal variations with and without 
front and back backgrounds move electric field action up 
and down in a known time frame. A truth table support new 
optoelectronic logic architecture.

DEVICE OPERATION 
The optoelectronic circuit consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-
n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n heterostructure with low conductivity doped 
layers 
as 
displayed 
in 
Fig.1. 
The 
optoelectronic

Monochromatic pulsed lights, separately (λR=626 nm; 
λG=526 nm, λB=470 nm, λV=400 nm; input channels) or in a 
polychromatic mixture (multiplexed signal) at different bit 
rates illuminated the device. 
Independent tuning of each channel is performed by 
steady state violet optical bias (λbias= 2300 µW/cm2) 
superimposed either from the front and back sides and the 
generated photocurrent measured at -8V. The device 
operates within the visible range using as input color 
channels (data) the wave square modulated light (external 
regulation of frequency and intensity) supplied by a red (R; 
25 µW/cm2), a green (G; 46 µW/cm2), a blue (B; 40 
µW/cm2) and  violet (V; 150 µW/cm2) LED’s.

Figure 2.  Normalized spectral photocurrent under front (a) and back (b) 
violet irradiations with different intensities. 
A peak fit adjustment to the data was performed (lines) 
with peaks centered on 630 nm (solid), 520 nm (dash) and 
430 nm (dot). Results show that under front violet 
irradiation, as the background intensity increases, the peak 
centered at 630 nm (red range) strongly increases while 
under back light an opposite behavior is observed and the 
red peak is strongly reduced (see arrows). Under front and 
back side irradiation, the peak at 520 nm (green range) 
increases slightly with the intensity. Under back irradiation, 
a new peak centered at 430 nm appears and increases with 
the background intensity. So, under front illumination the 
reddish part of the spectrum is strongly enhanced with the 
intensity 
while 
under 
back 
illumination 
the 
main 
enhancement occurs at the violet-blue region. A trade-off 
between the background intensity and the enhancement or 
quenching of the different spectral regions, under front and 
back irradiation, has to be established. 
In Fig. 3 the spectral gain (αV), defined as the ratio 
between the spectral photocurrents under violet illumination 
(applied from the front and back sides) and without it, is 
plotted at 3500 Hz and 2300µWcm-2. As expected from Fig. 
2, under back bias the gain is high at short wavelengths and 
strongly lowers for wavelengths higher than 500 nm, acting 
as a short-pass filter. Under violet front light the device 
works as a long-pass filter for wavelengths higher than 550 
nm, blocking the shorter wavelengths. Results show that by 
combining the background wavelengths and the irradiation 
side the short-, and long- spectral region can be sequentially 
tuned. The medium region can only be tuned by using both 
active filters.

ENCODER AND DECODER DEVICE 
A. Optical switching 
 
Four monochromatic pulsed lights separately (red, 
green, blue and violet input channels, Fig. 4) or combined 
(multiplexed signal, Fig. 5) illuminated the device at 12000 
bps. Steady state violet optical bias was superimposed 
separately from the front (a) and the back (b) sides and the 
photocurrent measured. In Fig. 4, the transient signals were 
normalized to their values without background and added 
the mean values of the optical gains for each individual 
channel. 
Results show that, even under transient conditions and 
using commercial LED’s as pulsed light sources, the 
background side affects the signal magnitude of the color 
channels. As in Fig. 2, under front irradiation, it enhances 
mainly the spectral sensitivity in the medium-long 
wavelength ranges (αV
R=4.7, αV
G=2.4). Violet radiation is 
absorbed at the top of the front diode, increasing the electric 
field at the back diode [7] where the red and part of the 
green incoming photons are absorbed (see Fig. 1). Under 
back irradiation the electric field increases mainly near the 
front p-n interface where the violet and part of the blue 
incoming channels generate most of the photocarriers 
(αV
V=11, αV
B=1.5). So, by switching between fronts to back 
irradiation the photonic function is modified from a long- to 
a short-pass filter allowing, alternately selecting the red or 
the violet channels.

Figure 4.  Normalized red (R), green (G) blue (B)and violet (V) transient 
signals at -8V with violet (400 nm) steady state optical bias applied from 
the front (a) and from the back (b) sides. 
B. Optoelectronic logic functions 
For an optoelectronic digital capture system, opto-
electronic conversion is the relationship between the optical 
inputs and the corresponding digital output levels.  
Fig. 5 displays the normalized MUX signals due to the 
combination of the input channels of Fig. 4, without and 
under front (a) and back (b) violet irradiations. On the top 
the signals used to drive the input channels are displayed 
showing the presence of all the possible 24 on/off states. For 
comparison the MUX signal without optical bias is 
displayed (dark) in both figures. 
Results show that the side of background affects the 
form and the magnitude of the MUX signal in opposite 
ways. Under front irradiation, sixteen levels (24) are 
detected and grouped into two main classes due to the high 
amplification of the red channel (αV
R>>1; Fig. 4a). The 
upper eight (23) levels are ascribed to the presence of the red 
channel (R=1), and the lower eight to its absence (R=0), 
allowing the red channel decoder (8-to-1 multiplexer; long-
pass filter function). Since under front irradiation the green 
channel is also amplified,( αV
G>1) the four  highest levels, in 
both classes, are ascribed to the presence of the green 
channel (G=1) and the four lower ones to its lack (G=0).

states. 
The blue channel is slightly amplified, so, in each group 
of 4 entries, two levels (21) can be found: the two higher 
levels correspond to the presence of the blue channel (B=1) 
and the two lowers to its absence (B=0). Finally, each group 
of 2 entries have two near sublevels, the higher where the

violet channels is ON (V=1) and the lower where it is 
missing (V=0). Under back irradiation, the violet channel is 
strongly enhanced, the blue channel is slightly and the green 
and red reduced (αV

Fig. 4b). The encoded multiplexed signal is, also, made of 
sixteen sublevels grouped into two main levels, the higher 
where the violet channel is ON (V=1) and the lower where 
it is OFF (V=0) (8-to-1 multiplexer; short-pass filter 
function). Each group the eight sublevels can be grouped in 
two classes, with and without the blue channel ON. Each of 
those classes split into four near sublevels, attributed to the 
presence or absence of the red and green channel. If we 
consider this red and green output bits “not significant” only 
four separate levels (22) are considered and the logic MUX 
function is converted into a logic filter function. The violet 
channel is then decoded.

The binary code is an arithmetic code and so, it is 
weighted, i. e. there is specific weights assigned to each bit 
position. Due to the different optical gains (Fig. 3), the 
selection index for those 16-element look-up table are a 4-
bit binary [RGBV] code under front irradiation or a 4-bit 
binary [VBGR] of the form [S3, S2, S1,S0] where Sn means 
the color channel (right side of Fig. 5) with n weighted by 
the amplification factor (Fig. 4). The multiplexer select code 
represents an address or index, into the ordered inputs.  
The truth tables of the encoders of Fig. 5, that perform 
16-to-1 MUX function, are shown in Fig. 6. The 
correspondence between the on/off state of the input 
channels and the [RGBV] code under front irradiation, and 
the [VBRG] code under back irradiation are obvious. In the 
inputs (x0….x15), the index of each bit, is related to the first 
(highest) nonzero logic input. Here, the MUX device 
selects, through the front or back violet backgrounds, one of 
the sixteen possible input logic signals and sends it to the 
output (y=xS). In Fig. 6a the output is a 4-bit binary RGBV 
number that may identify one of sixteen possible inputs. Just 
as the multiplexer has a binary code for the selection of an 
input, the demultiplexer (DEMUX) has a similar code for 
selecting a particular output. The 4-bit output RGBV code 
allows designing an encoder to transform a four-line-to-
sixteen-line decoder. From truth table of Fig. 6a, the 
Boolean functions for the encoder with inputs x0 to x15 and 
outputs R, G, B, V is given as:  
R(S3)=∑(8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15); 
G(S2)=∑(4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15); 
B(S1)=∑(2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15); 
V(S0)=∑(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15).  
A binary representation for decimal number 9 is in 
RGBV code “1001” (23+0+0+20) under front irradiation and 
it corresponds to both red and violet channels ON. Under 
back irradiation (VBRG code) the binary representation is 
the same although the weights assigned to each bit position 
are different (see arrows in Fig. 5). This 4-bit output RGBV 
code allows us design a 4-to-10 line decoder to transform a 
decimal number (0 to 9) into a binary code. The 4-bit codes 
from 1010 through 1111 do not arise from the encoding of 
the decimal numbers. 
V. 
DATA ROUTER 
Whereas the multiplexer is a data selector, the 
demultiplexer is a data distributor or data router. Just as the 
multiplexer has a binary code (RGBV) for the selection of 
an input, the demultiplexer has a similar code for selecting a 
particular output. In the pi’n/pin device the side of the 
background is the routing control for the data source. The 
front and back background acts as selector to select one of 
the four incoming channels by splitting portions of the input 
multi-channel optical signal across the front and back 
photodiodes. This duality of functions is characteristic of 
decoders and demultiplexers.  
Under front background the red channel is decoded due 
to its higher amplification while under back violet 
irradiation the violet channel is selected (Figs. 5 and 6). To 
help to decode the green and blue channels, in Fig. 7 the 
difference between the multiplex signal under front and 
back violet irradiation is displayed.

Figure 7.  Wavelength difference generation. On the top the signal to drive 
the input channels guide the eyes.  
This difference wavelength generation is a consequence 
of nonlinear interaction of the device with the front or back 
backgrounds and the optical channels generation. It weights 
the red versus violet content of the measured signal, so, it 
enhances the effect of the routing control and offers a 
transparent wavelength conversion. The presence of the red 
channel pushes the difference up and the violet channel 
pushes it down (right side of Fig. 5). The blue channel does 
not affect the difference. So, after decoding the red and the 
violet 
transmitted 
information 
and 
comparing 
with 
difference wavelength generation levels in the same time 
slots, the green and blue signals can be immediately 
decoded. 
We have used this simple algorithm to perform 1 -to-16 
demultiplexer (DEMUX) function and to decode the 
multiplex signals. As proof of concept the decoding 
algorithm was implemented in Matlab [8] and tested using 
different binary sequences. In Fig. 8a a random MUX signal 
under front and back irradiation is displayed and in Fig. 8b 
the decoding results are shown. On the top of both figures 
the signals to drive the LED’s and the DEMUX signals 
obtained as well as the binary bit sequences are respectively 
displayed. A good agreement between the signals used to 
drive the LED’s and the decoded sequences is achieved. In 
all sequences tested the RGBV signals were correctly 
decoded.  
The DEMUX sends the input logic signal to one of its 
sixteen outputs, according to the optoelectronic demux 
algorithm. So, by means of optical control applied to the 
front or back diodes, the photonic function is modified, 
respectively from a long- pass filter to pick the red channel 
to a short-pass filter to select the violet channel, giving a 
step reconfiguration of the device. The green and blue 
channels are selected by combining both active long- and 
101

short-pass filters into a band-pass filter. In practice, the 
decoding 
applications 
far 
outnumber 
those 
of 
demultiplexing. Multilayer SiC/Si optical technology can 
provide a smart solution to communication problem by 
providing a possibility of optical bypass for the transit 
traffic by dropping the fractional traffic that is needed at a 
particular point.

CONCLUSIONS  
An optoelectronic device based on a-SiC:H technology 
is analyzed. The device is able to act simultaneously as a 4-
bit binary encoder or a binary decoder in a 4-to-16 line 
configurations.  
A relationship between the optical inputs and the 
corresponding digital output levels is established. A binary 
weighted color code that takes into account the specific 
weights assigned to each bit position establish the 
optoelectronic functions. A truth table of an encoder that 
performs 16-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) function is presented. 
A decode algorithm based on the optical bias control of the 
device was improved. 
More work as to be done in order to execute optical 
arithmetic micro-operations entirely within the optical 
domain.
