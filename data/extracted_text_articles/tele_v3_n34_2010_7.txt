Abstract—This paper focuses on the task of spectrum assign-
ment and the transmission power in the context of downlink 
OFDMA femtocell deployments. Concretely, the paper studies 
the impact of different levels of coordination between femto-
cells in a decentralized framework to perform spectrum and 
transmission power assignment. Two cooperative schemes are 
proposed, named non-communicative and communicative re-
spectively. In the first case, each femtocell decide the spectrum 
and power assignment based on users’ reported measurements, 
which are employed to sense intercell interference, including 
that from other femtocells or from macrocells in two-layer 
deployments. In the second case, femtocells are allowed to ex-
plicitly communicate other nearby femtocells the radio re-
source usage. Performance results have been obtained for a 
realistic indoor femtocell deployment with and without macro-
cell interference. The paper shows that both schemes based on 
self-organization can lead to sensible performance improve-
ments over non-cooperative (selfish) schemes in terms of spec-
tral efficiency and power consumption reductions. Finally, the 
dynamic response of the framework to changes in the network 
deployment has been analyzed.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Self-organization is taking an important role in femtocell 
(FC) deployments [1][2]. Femtocells are small range and low 
cost user-deployed base stations introduced at a considerable 
amount of random locations such as users’ homes and with 
end connectivity through a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) 
backhaul. Differently from Wi-Fi access points, they are 
deployed in a network operator’s frequency licensed band, 
allowing the extension of indoor coverage and thus increas-
ing network capacity. However, FC deployments introduce 
several technical challenges that have to be overcome [3]. 
For instance, the assignment of frequency resources to FCs 
to mitigate intercell interference cannot be performed as in 
typical macrocell (MC) scenarios. In that case, the spectrum 
assignment task is carried out off-line during the network 
deployment phase, once the exact MCs’ transmitter positions 
are known, usually requiring a lot of human supervision. On 
the other hand, the high number of FC transmitters and espe-
cially the random and distributed nature of the FC deploy-
ment would make unpractical the success of such manual 
configuration of the spectrum in use. Hence, it becomes ne-
cessary to include appropriate capabilities in each FC so that 
FCs can automatically reconfigure the spectrum assignment 
and minimize the human interaction. This is one of the main 
reasons to use self-organization to manage FC deployments. 
Self-organization is the ability of a system composed of 
several entities to adopt a particular structure and perform 
certain functions to fulfill a global purpose without any ex-
ternal supervisor or central dedicated control entity [4]. In 
the field of mobile cellular networks, several tasks have been 
identified to adjust network parameters including self-
configuration in pre-operational state, self-optimization in 
operational state, and self-healing in case of failure of a net-
work element [5], bringing operational and capital expendi-
tures reductions. Therefore, activities in several projects and 
standardization bodies are steered to study the automation of 
network procedures [6], [7]. 
The main characteristics of a self-organized system are 
its distributed nature and the localized interactivity between 
system elements. That is, each entity performs its operation 
based only on the information retrieved from other entities in 
its vicinity. Hence, self-organization clearly takes a relevant 
role in the context of FCs networks. For instance, [8] propos-
es a self-optimization scheme for frequency planning in the 
context of OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Mul-
tiple Access) FCs. It has been agreed that OFDMA radio 
access interfaces offer appealing properties such as robust-
ness against multipath fading and high spectral flexibility. 
Then, as shown in [8], OFDMA FCs facilitate the develop-
ment of such dynamic self-organization mechanisms, and 
proof of that is that they are being included in the latest spe-
cifications for LTE (Long-Term Evolution) system [9]. On 
the other hand, [10] presents a self-optimization scheme for 
the coverage (transmission power) in CDMA (Code Division 
Multiple Access) FCs in the presence of MC interference. 
However, it is expected that in OFDMA FCs, high transmis-
sion power reductions can be obtained. That is, the high 
spectral flexibility of OFDMA can allow finding spectrum 
assignments that enable a FC to operate in an ‘interference 
free’ state. Then, transmission power could be reduced from 
maximum power to a lower level for acceptable communica-
tions taking only into account thermal noise. Hence, energy 
saving is attained, being in line with recent trends within 
green communications [11] that pursue an efficient resource 
(energy) usage to reduce CO2 emissions.  
More recently, other approaches to simultaneously op-
timize the spectrum assignment and transmission power in 
OFDMA FCs have been proposed [1][12]. However, the

impact of the different coordination methods between FCs in 
the decentralized resource assignment problem has not been 
addressed.  
This paper proposes a decentralized framework to jointly 
self-optimize the spectrum assignment and the transmission 
power for the downlink of an OFDMA FC deployment with-
in the coverage area of an OFDMA MC deployment, and 
analyzes the performance of several coordination levels be-
tween FCs. Concretely, two cooperative schemes where each 
FC takes into account the spectrum and power usage in near-
by FCs are compared. The two strategies are named commu-
nicative and non-communicative schemes depending on 
whether an explicit exchange of information between FCs is 
allowed. We have tested the framework over a realistic in-
door FC scenario with and without MC interference. Numer-
ical results show that, compared with reference schemes, the 
self-optimization framework can improve overall spectral 
efficiency (in bits/s/Hz) while quality-of-service (QoS) of 
ongoing users’ sessions is preserved. Moreover, the self-
optimization of the transmission power allows to save energy 
and to reduce intercell interference. Also, an analysis of the 
dynamic response of the framework reveals that the commu-
nicative scheme can react better to changes in the FCs dep-
loyment than the non-communicative scheme. On the other 
hand, the communicative scheme requires from signaling 
between FCs to exchange the resource utilization messages. 
In the following, Section II introduces the deployment 
scenarios in OFDMA FCs and the different levels of coordi-
nation. Next, Section III presents the self-organized frame-
work whereas Section IV describes the self-optimization 
algorithms for spectrum assignment and transmission power. 
Then, the simulation model is presented in Section V, and 
obtained results are discussed in Section VI. Finally, Section 
VII states conclusions of this work.    
II. 
OFDMA FEMTOCELL DEPLOYMENTS 
In the following, the spectrum allocation and the different 
levels of coordination in OFDMA FCs are presented. 
A. Spectrum Allocation 
In general, OFDMA FCs will co-exist with large cover-
age operator-deployed OFDMA MCs, leading to a two-layer 
deployment (i.e., one layer for MCs and another for FCs). 
Since an OFDMA radio interface divides the available spec-
trum in several frequency subchannels, two or more cells 
using the same subchannel can interfere each other. This is 
particularly crucial in an OFDMA radio interface, because 
intercell interference dramatically reduces the data rate that 
users in a given cell can obtain. Therefore, intercell interfe-
rence in the MC layer is mitigated through the use of Fre-
quency Reuse Factors [13], where the available spectrum is 
distributed among MCs following a fixed regular pattern. 
Furthermore, interference between FCs in the FC layer can-
not be in general neglected due to FCs’ proximity, (e.g., in 
dense scenarios like buildings with at least one FC per 
home/office), and then appropriate interference avoidance 
methods are needed. 
Nevertheless, one of the main challenges in the two-layer 
scenario is the management of the potential cross-layer in-
tercell interference, due to the uncontrolled appearance of 
FCs from the network operator point of view. As depicted in 
Fig. 1, one of the simplest mechanisms to avoid the cross-
layer interference is to employ an orthogonal spectrum dep-
loyment, where the macro- and femto- cell layers use differ-
ent spectrum bands and spectrum management is indepen-
dently performed for each layer. However, this deployment 
can reduce overall system capacity. On the contrary, co-
channel spectrum assignment shares the available spectrum 
band between the MC and the FC layers, increasing the 
available capacity for each one but at the cost of complex 
management of the intercell interference. For instance, it has 
been determined that the MC coverage can decay dramatical-
ly around FCs due to the excessive interference leaked by 
FCs [14][15]. Moreover, it has been showed that [16] impor-
tant capacity gains can be obtained in the MC layer by deriv-
ing indoor users to FC layer, where this gain depends on the 
MC transmit power configuration affecting the interference 
produced to the FC layer.

deployments 
B. Levels of Coordination 
For FC deployments, an operator-controlled spectrum as-
signment as in the MC case is unfeasible whereas decentra-
lized approaches provide the necessary independency so that 
FCs can autonomously react to network changes. Neverthe-
less, some kind of coordination between FCs is needed to 
converge to appropriate solutions.  
Different levels of coordination are possible depending 
on the information that a given FC handles to make its deci-
sion. This is sketched in Fig. 2 where three distinct coordina-
tion levels have been distinguished. First, resource assign-
ment strategies can be classified between non-cooperative 
and cooperative. Non-cooperative strategies only take into 
account, for each FC, information from the own FC, without 
considering the actions taken by other cells in the surround-
ings. Then, they fall in a sort of selfish strategies and usually 
are used as reference approaches from comparison purposes. 
For instance, random schemes such as those used in [17][18] 
equally divide the available spectrum band into V  portions, 

184

and each FC randomly selects one of them. The greater V , 
the lower the probability that two adjacent FCs use the same 
portion, but also the lower the available capacity in each FC. 
On the other hand, cooperative schemes do take into ac-
count information about resource assignment in other nearby 
cells in order to plan the spectrum assignment accordingly. 
Two subtypes can be distinguished named as non-
communicative and communicative. The non-communicative 
scheme bases on the feedback of the users to analyze the 
spectrum and power usage in nearby cells including both 
other FCs and MCs. Hence it relies on users’ measurements 
reports that are periodically sent to the FCs base station in 
uplink. On the other hand, the communicative scheme addi-
tionally allows that FCs can exchange explicit information 
regarding their spectrum and power usage. This can be done 
through the wireless interface or though the DSL backhaul. 
The main benefit of the communicative scheme is that a giv-
en FC manages the exact resource assignment decision taken 
by other cells in the surroundings, so that its decision could 
be more accurate and not only relies on users’ measure-
ments. In fact, we will see in the results section the impact of 
the measurements report period on the communicative and 
non-communicative strategies, showing that it could degrade 
the performance of the non-communicative schemes. How-
ever, communicative schemes suppose an additional signal-
ing overhead for the wireless or DSL interface.  
 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL AND FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE 
Fig. 3 depicts the system model and functional architec-
ture for each OFDMA FC. Fig. 3(a) shows an autonomous 
FC surrounded by other cells (in general macro- and/or fem-
to- cells). Each FC performs autonomous spectrum assign-
ment and transmission power decisions with the objective of 
improving FC’s spectral efficiency while guaranteeing FC 
users’ QoS and optimizing power consumption.  
An OFDMA radio interface is considered in downlink for 
users’ data transmission, where a system bandwidth, W , is 
divided into N  subchannels 

 Hz. Moreover, 
time is divided into frames. The minimum radio resource 
block assignable to users is one subchannel per frame. On 
the other hand, there is an uplink control channel where users 
send instantaneous (frame-by-frame) measurements report 
messages. As it is explained in the following, these reports 
provide to the FC the means to approximate, channel status 
in the short-term to perform the link adaptation for each es-
tablished downlink communication link, and cell status in 
the medium-term to perform reliable spectrum and power 
assignment. 
The functional architecture is depicted in Fig. 3(b).  It is a 
hierarchical architecture where the operation of the FC is 
divided into two timescales.  
A. Short-term  
In the short-term, the FC schedules users’ transmissions 
into the OFDMA time-frequency grid following standard 
scheduling strategies, which are implemented in the Short-
Term Scheduler (STS) functional block. Moreover, STS also 
performs link adaptation. That is, users’ transmission bitrate 
is variable by means of Adaptive Modulation and Coding 
(AMC), where an appropriate modulation and coding 
scheme is associated to each instantaneous quality measure-
ment of the channel (i.e., Signal to Interference plus Noise 
Ratio: SINR) [19]. The detailed SINR thresholds for each 
modulation and coding rate considered are given in Table I.  
B. Medium-term 
In the medium-term (seconds or tens of seconds), the FC 
changes (if needed) the usage of spectrum and transmission 
power. To this end, the Self-optimization functional block is 
introduced as depicted in Fig. 3(b). 
The core of the self-optimization block is the self-
optimization algorithms (explained in next section) that de-
termine which subchannels the FC should use and the trans-
mission power per subchannel. The FC executes these algo-
rithms following a self-optimization period of L  frames, so 
that each FC is periodically reacting to changes in its envi-
ronment, that is, changes in the perceived interference affect-
ing the performance of the FC.

The Status Observer module is in charge of building the 
cell status given as an input to the self-optimization algo-
rithms. The cell status consists of (i) the average intercell 
interference plus thermal noise per subchannel 
nI , (ii) the 
average pathloss in downlink in the FC 
PLDL
, and (iii) the 
average spectral efficiency   in bits/s/Hz. The average in-
tercell interference per subchannel and downlink pathloss in 
the FC can be obtained from the measurement reports given 
by users. It is worth mentioning that these measurements are 
usual in mobile cellular systems to perform typical radio 
resource management procedures like, e.g., handovers [20]. 
Then users are periodically reporting these measurements 
averaged during a measurements period of l  frames. In or-
der to have the most up-to-date information, only the metrics 
obtained during last period prior the execution of the self-
optimization algorithms are passed to them. Moreover, the 
average spectral efficiency can be estimated by the FC by 
averaging the quotient between the short-term FC throughput 
and the assigned bandwidth to the FCs during the last mea-
surements period. Note that  
nI  can include both the MC and 
the other FC interference. Then, the proposed scheme will be 
able to adapt in a general co-channel MC and FC deploy-
ment. 
Finally, notice that if two adjacent FCs execute simulta-
neously the self-optimization algorithms, then the stability of 
the framework would be compromised, since both FCs 
would try to change the spectrum and power assignment at 
the same time without knowing the final solution of the other 
FC respectively. Then, in order to minimize the probability 
that two FCs execute the self-optimization algorithms simul-
taneously, each FC randomly selects, from the next L  
frames after switch-on, the initial frame where the self-
optimization period starts. Then, since large values of L  are 
expected, then the probability that two adjacent FCs choose 
the same initial frame can be very low. Moreover, as it will 
be seen in the results section, it is desirable that l
 L
 so 
that the measurements taken during the last measurement 
period before the execution of the self-optimization algo-
rithms reflect the latest stable up-to-date information. In oth-
er words, a short measurements period reduces the probabili-
ty that neighboring FCs of a given FC change the spectrum 
and power assignment during the last measurement period, 
thus compromising the accuracy of the measurements.  
IV. 
SELF-OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS 
In the following, two strategies (non-communicative and 
communicative) to optimize the spectrum assignment and 
transmission power of a FC are presented. 
A. Cooperative and non-communicative strategy 
In the non-communicative strategy, only measurements 
reported by users to de FC base station are considered.  
1) Spectrum assignment  
Regarding the spectrum assignment, the strategy divides 
the decision into two stages. In the first one the algorithm 
decides the number of subchannels, C , that the FC needs in 
order to fulfill in average with users’ throughput expecta-
tions. Assume that there are U  users in the FC and that the 
u-th
 user is satisfied if the assigned throughput is above 
QoS target 
thtarget,u
. Then, the number of subchannels is 
computed as:

where B  is the subchannel bandwidth in Hz, and   is the 
average spectral efficiency (provided by Status Observer).  
Basically, the expression in (1) computes C  by dividing 
the total requested throughput in the FC between the esti-
mated cell capacity for that FC. In addition, 
1
   is a mar-
gin factor to allow the estimation of the number of subchan-
nels to be conservative. That is, some extra subchannels 
could be needed to cope with instantaneous fluctuations of 
the wireless channel, affecting the spectral efficiency per 
subchannel, which could be punctually lower than  . Final-
ly, notice that C  is bounded to a minimum of one subchan-
nel and, to a maximum of N  system available subchannels. 
In the second stage, the spectrum assignment algorithm 
sorts the N  available system subchannels in increasing order 
depending on the average intercell interference during the 
last period (
nI ). Then, the C  first sorted subchannels are 
selected. Hence, the spectrum assignment algorithm in each 
FC tends to use the best subchannels according to the inter-
cell interference perceived by its users. Finally, it is assumed 
that, after switch-on, a FC initially selects a random spec-
trum assignment. 
2) Power assignment 
Once the spectrum assignment is decided, the transmis-
sion power for each assigned subchannel, 
nP , is adjusted as:

adjustment in (2) tends to set the transmission power so that 
an average SINR of   dB is attained in the FC. Notice that 
nP  is maintained between the range [
min

max
P
].
min
P
 is a 
minimum power necessary to avoid excessive power reduc-
tion in the absence of intercell interference (a possible situa-
tion in an OFDMA interface depending on the subchannel 
assignment in the femtocell and other adjacent femtocells). 
On the other hand, 
max
P
 is the maximum power per sub-
channel in dBm due to maximum FC power limitation. Fi-
nally, it is considered that after switch-on a FC starts with 
max
P
 in all assigned subchannels. 
B. Cooperative and communicative scheme 
The communicative scheme takes into account explicit 
information exchanged between FCs. In this case, we assume 
that after the execution period of L  frames each FC k  in-
forms the other FCs in the set of neighboring FCs, 
k
 , 
about the set of subchannels, 
k
 , that the FC is planning to 
use. Each FC can build the set of neighboring FCs, 
k
 , us-
ing the measurement information reported by its users. Also, 
in case that a MC layer is present (i.e., co-channel spectrum 
allocation), the FC will add to 
k
  the strongest MC (attend-
ing to received channel power from MCs), m, and will com-
pute 
m
  from measurements of the MC activity. Notice that, 
in this paper, direct communication of the FCs with the MC 
is not allowed. However, this communication could be ex-
ploited if, for instance, the operator broadcasts some infor-
mation about the MC deployment to FCs through the DSL 
backhaul.  
1) Spectrum assignment 
As in the non-communicative strategy, the spectrum as-
signment algorithm is divided into two stages. In the first 
stage the number of subchannels needed C  is computed 
following (1), which considered the requested throughput by 
users in the FC and the estimated capacity. 
In the second stage, the spectrum assignment algorithm 
exploits the information collected from nearby FCs: 
 
First selects the subchannels that are not used by any 
FC in the set of neighboring FCs (i.e., all subchan-
nels n  that fulfill that 
j
n  
k
j
  ).  
 
If the number of selected subchannels is still lower 
than C , then the FC selects from the remaining sub-
channels not selected in the previous step those with 
the lowest intercell interference 
nI . 
Basically, the communicative algorithm pursues the same 
objective as the non-communicative one, since it tries,  for a 
given FC, to minimize the interference received from other 
FCs (and strongest MC). What makes the difference is that 
the communicative algorithm uses the exact assignment in 
the set of neighboring FCs and this is key advantage regard-
ing the adaptability of the algorithm as it will be seen in the 
results section.  
2) Power assignment 
As for the power assignment, it would be also possible 
for the FCs to exchange the transmission power per chunk 
and then it would be feasible to estimate the expected inter-
cell interference received by users. However, this requires 
that users also report the estimated pathloss for all the cells 
in the set of neighboring FCs, thus increasing the signaling 
overhead. Then, we have opted for using the same procedure 
as for the non-communicative scheme where the intercell 
interference 
nI  per subchannel computed by Status Observer 
from measurements reports is used.  
V. 
SIMULATION MODEL 
We consider a downlink OFDMA-based scenario with a 
total of N  12 subchannels of 375 kHz available in the sys-
tem. The scenario is composed of 7 MCs and 12 FCs inside a 
building as depicted in Fig 4. MC radius is 500 m and the 
building is situated at approximately 200 m of the central 
MC. Each one of the offices has 20x20 m2, and the FC is 
located at the office’s center. For indoor coverage, the COST 
231 Multi-Wall Model (MWM) is used [21]. Height of the 
building’s walls is 4 m. Inner walls are considered as ‘nar-
row’ walls (i.e., with small penetration losses), whereas ex-
ternal walls are considered as ‘thick’ walls. Penetration 
losses for doors and windows are also considered. Propaga-
tion model parameters and other default simulation values 
are presented in Table II. 
On the other hand, indoor users in FCs are static and al-
ways have data ready to be sent (i.e., full-buffer traffic mod-
el), so that each user tries to obtain as much capacity as poss-
ible. However, a user is satisfied when a given throughput 
threshold 
thtarget,u
 is reached. Finally, the well-known propor-
tional fair scheduling [22] strategy is considered for resource 
assignment to users in the short-term according to functional 
architecture presented in Section III.  
 
We will consider an orthogonal and co-channel spectrum 
allocation for the FC deployment. For the orthogonal spec-
trum allocation simply the MC layer is not considered, so 
that the N  subchannels do not have MC interference. On the 
other hand, the co-channel allocation considers a MC dep-
loyment with a FRF3 spectrum assignment, i.e., the central 
MC uses one third of the spectrum and the rest of the MCs 
alternate one of the other 2 subbands.  
Besides, we consider two distributions of the users in the 
FC scenario, named in the following as homogeneous and 
heterogeneous distributions. In the homogeneous distribu-
tion, 4 users are deployed in each office (i.e., FC) whereas in 
the heterogeneous distribution, half of the offices has 8 users 
and the rest 4 users.

RESULTS 
A. Tunig of the self-optimization algorithms 
In this section we first assess the behavior of both the 
communicative and non-communicative schemes with regard 
to the value of the margin factor (  ) and average target 
SINR ( ).  
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the evolution of the dissatisfaction 
probability (i.e., a QoS metric as the probability that the us-
er’s throughput is below the satisfaction throughput target), 
spectral efficiency, and transmission power consumption per 
subchannel for different values of   and   respectively. 
These results are presented for the orthogonal and co-channel 
spectrum allocation and for 1024 and 2048 kbits/s (kbps) of 
requested throughput per user, with a homogeneous distribu-
tion 
It can be seen in Figures that a better performance (i.e., 
lower dissatisfaction probability and transmission power and 
higher spectral efficiency) is achieved for an orthogonal 
spectrum allocation than for a co-channel allocation. This is 
because of the higher intercell interference that this latter 
allocation produces due to the presence of MCs.  
More into details, it can be seen that increasing the mar-
gin factor  has a positive effect on dissatisfaction probabili-
ty since this augments the number of estimated needed sub-
channels (see (1)). Hence more capacity is set per FC. How-
ever, this also increases the intercell interference between 
FCs (and also the MC) and thus the spectral efficiency is 
reduced. Also, the transmission power per subchannel is in-
creased.  Hence, there is a tradeoff on the selection of the 
margin factor. For instance a value around between 1.2 and 
1.6 would be adequate for avoiding too high dissatisfaction 
probability and too low spectral efficiency. On the other 
hand, increasing the value of the target SINR   in the power 
assignment algorithm (see (2)) has a logical positive impact 
on the dissatisfaction probability and spectral efficiency, 
since the power assignment tends to augment the average 
SINR in the FC. However, a too high target SINR does not 
translates into an improvement on dissatisfaction probability 
and spectral efficiency, and alternatively only produces an 
unnecessary increment of the transmitted power (and FC 
consumption). Thus, again, there is a tradeoff where in this 
case a value between 15 and 20 dB for the target SINR is 
adequate.  
Nevertheless, the optimal values for   and   can 
change depending on the scenario (e.g., the traffic load, the 
FCs deployment, etc.) and thus a static selection of these 
values can be inaccurate in some cases. Then self-tuning 
mechanisms for these parameters appear as a potential im-
provement that should be studied in future work. 
B. Performance comparison 
In the following, we compare the performance of the co-
operative (communicative and non-communicative) schemes 
for spectrum and power assignment in FCs with a non-
cooperative scheme. As stated previously in Section II.B, a 
random spectrum assignment with constant power is usually 
taken as a reference for a non-cooperative scheme in litera-
ture [17][18]. In this scheme, the spectrum is divided into 
V =3 equal portions and each FC randomly selects one of 
them to operate after switch-on.  
Results are presented in terms of spectral efficiency, dis-
satisfaction probability, and transmission power consump-
tion per subchannel. We have considered three different thre-
sholds for the satisfaction throughput as 512, 1024, 2048 
kbits/s, so that the behavior of the non-cooperative and coop-
erative strategies with different QoS requirements are as-
sessed.  
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the performance comparison for 
the orthogonal and co-channel spectrum allocation respec-
tively. Both Figures show the same qualitative performance, 
but, Fig. 8 attains lower spectral efficiency, slightly higher 
the dissatisfaction probability, and higher power consump-
tion because of the presence of the MC layer, which increas-
es the intercell interference. Fig. 7(a-c) and Fig. 8(a-c) show 
the performance comparison for the homogeneous distribu-
tion of the users in the building. Comparing the non-
cooperative and the cooperative strategies, the cooperative 
schemes (communicative and non-communicative) demon-
strates the best trade-off between QoS fulfillment and spec-
tral efficiency. For instance, for 512 kbits/s satisfaction 
throughput, they obtain the best spectral efficiency with a 
reduced dissatisfaction probability. On the other hand, for 
2048 kbits/s satisfaction throughput, each FC demands a 
higher number of subchannels to cope with the traffic de-
mand, what translates into a higher intercell interference and 
hence into a reduction of the spectral efficiency. However, 
compared with the non-cooperative strategy, the cooperative 
schemes considerably reduce the dissatisfaction probability.

Moreover, regarding the power consumption, the cooperative 
schemes can achieve important energy savings, especially in 
the orthogonal spectrum allocation and for low throughputs. 
In this case, due to low intercell interference, FCs can oper-
ate near the minimum power per subchannel with compro-
mising neither the spectral efficiency nor the dissatisfaction 
probability. Notice that in the presence of MC interference 
(co-channel spectrum allocation) the FCs react by increasing 
the power per subchannel.  
It is worth to remark the close performance that both the 
communicative and non-communicative schemes demon-
strate, although a slightly better performance is attained by 
the communicative scheme. This reveals that both schemes 
are adequate for spectrum and power optimization in FCs 
attending to performance. However, results in next subsec-
tion reveal that other aspects should be taken into account 
such as the tradeoff between signaling overhead and dynam-
ic response. 
Moreover, it is important to highlight the effect of a hete-
rogeneous spatial distribution of the traffic load as shown in 
Fig. 7(d-e) and Fig. 8(d-e). There, the benefits of the cooper-
ative schemes are appreciable even with lower satisfaction 
throughputs than those achieved in the homogeneous case. 
Notice that, in general, a heterogeneous distribution of the 
load will be common in real scenarios. Thus, this calls for 
using adaptive approaches such as the proposed cooperative 
schemes. 
Finally, as an example of the SINR improvements that 
self-organization could bring to FC deployments, Fig. 9 
shows the SINR distribution in the proximities of the build-
ing for both the orthogonal and co-channel spectrum alloca-
tion. The spectrum and power assignments for the non-
cooperative and the non-communicative schemes in the ho-
mogeneous distribution with 512 kbits/s are considered (ana-
logous results have been found for the other tests and the 
communicative strategy). Points outside the building are 
taken as if they were connected to the central MC when ap-
plicable (co-channel). It can be seen that, the cooperative 
scheme considerably ameliorates overall FC’s SINR with 
respect to the non-cooperative scheme. Concretely, in co-
channel spectrum allocation the cooperative scheme does not 
create interference in the MC layer (brown color) whereas 
the non-cooperative scheme reduces in several dBs the SINR 
in the building’s surroundings. It has been determined that in 
the former, FC layer self-organizes so that each FC uses dif-
ferent subchannels to those used by the central MC. Howev-
er, it is appreciable a considerable reduction of the SINR in 
the FCs compared with the orthogonal spectrum allocation.

It has been checked that, for each FC, this is mainly because 
of the interference produced by the other MCs, rather than by 
other FCs. Hence, in general, the interference from MCs 
distinct of the MC where FCs are deployed cannot be neg-
lected. 
C. Dynamic response 
This section studies the dynamic response of the pro-
posed framework, that is, the ability of the different FCs ex-
ecuting the self-optimization algorithms to adapt to changes 
in the  network deployment. In the following, results are giv-
en for the orthogonal spectrum allocation with homogeneous 
traffic and a throughput target per user of 512 kbits/s. 
Fig. 10 shows the adaptability (in terms of the time evo-
lution of (a) dissatisfaction probability, (b) spectral efficien-
cy and (c) transmission power per subchannel) of the non-
cooperative, 
non-communicative 
and 
communicative 
schemes for the FC deployment. The figure shows a case 
where the central MC is activated at time instant 50 (time is 
normalized to the self-optimization period). Thus, at this 
moment, FCs in the building perceive an abrupt increment of 
the intercell interference in the subchannels used by the MC. 
Three different ratios of the measurements report period ( l ) 
to the self-optimization period ( L ) are evaluated. A high 
value (e.g., /l L =1) supposes that it is very probable that 
neighboring FCs of a given FC also change the spectrum and 
power assignment during the last measurement period. 
Hence, some averaged measurements during the last mea-
surements period can be inaccurate.   
It can be seen in all subplots of Fig. 10 that the response 
of the non-cooperative scheme does not depend on /l L , 
since the spectrum assignment is randomly selected without 
taking into account measurements. On the other hand, the 
non-communicative and communicative strategies show very 
different behaviors. For 
/l L =1, both algorithms demon-
strate a very fast response to the increment on intercell inter-
ference. However, the non-communicative scheme reveals a 
poor performance since the measurements information that is 
taken is not up-to-date (i.e., neighbors of a FC were changing 
their resource assignment during the last measurements pe-
riod). On the other hand, the communicative scheme 
achieves a good performance, since the spectrum assignment 
in a FC is based on the latest spectrum assignment sent by 
other FCs. Nevertheless, for /l L =0.1, both schemes show a 
very similar and good performance, although the response of 
the FC deployment to the activation of the central MC is 
slower. In this case, since l
 L
, it is less probable for a 
given FC that another neighbor FC changes the spectrum 
assignment during the last measurement period, thus suppos-
ing an improvement in performance of the non-
communicative scheme. 
 Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 illustrate how the FCs in the building 
self-organize the spectrum and the power assignment after 
the activation of the central MC for /l L =1 and /l L =0.1 
respectively. Figures show evolution of the average spectral 
efficiency for seven time instants around the activation of the 
central MC (time instant 50). Notice that, after MC activa-
tion, the spectral efficiency dramatically decays for all FC, 
but at time instant 70 (20 executions later), the spectral effi-
ciency has increased for the communicative scheme. This is 
also the case for the non-communicative scheme in Fig. 12, 
although in Fig 11. the inaccuracy of the measurements 
avoids proper self-organization of the FC deployment. 
Finally, it is important to remark that the success of the 
communicative scheme has an associated cost in terms of 
signaling overhead. Qualitatively, in order to communicate 
with adjacent FCs, each FC under the communicative 
scheme, has to transmit 
k · (

 bits/s. 
Here, 
k  is the number of neighboring FCs, 
sb , is the num-
ber of bits needed to encode spectrum usage per subchannel, 
id
b  is the number of bits devoted to code FC’s identification, 
and 
fT  is the frame time and thus (1/

 is the update 
frequency that depends on the self-optimization period. On 
the other hand, the signaling needed for measurements in a

frame short-term scheduling,  
In

bPL
 the bits needed to 
report intercell interference and pathloss respectively, and l  
the measurements period in frames.  
Since the signaling for measurements is present in both 
the non-communicative and communicative schemes, and 
the signaling for communication of the FCs is exclusive of 
the communicative scheme, quotient between the signaling 
and for communication and the signaling needed for mea-
surements can be used as a metric to analyze the signaling 
overhead of the communicative scheme. Fig. 13 shows this 
quotient for different values of 
k , N  and U , and with 
respect to the value of L . All magnitudes are encoded with 8 
bits and 
l  500
 frames and 
fT =2 ms. Certainly, the signal-
ing overhead demonstrates an inverse relation with the self-
optimization period L . Then low values of L  can yield to a

high signaling overhead of around 20%, especially for a low 
number of users and a high number of neighboring FCs as 
shown in Fig. 13. However, notice that for a high number of 
users in the FC, the signaling overhead tends to be negligi-
ble, since in this case the signaling for measurements is do-
minant. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has shown that self-organization is a suitable 
approach when facing resource management in OFDMA FC 
networks. Concretely, self-optimization algorithms for both 
spectrum and transmission power per OFDMA subchannel 
assignment have been proposed, showing that the inclusion 
of these algorithms can bring notable performance improve-
ments, especially in two-layer deployments with MCs and 
heterogeneous spatial distribution of the traffic load.  
 
Moreover, it has been determined that the effect of  MCs 
distinct of the MC where FCs are deployed cannot be neg-
lected. That is, those MCs could negatively interfere FCs 
producing a performance reduction. Hence, multicell MC 
deployments should be used in two-layer MC and FC per-

formance evaluations, rather than single-cell MC plus FCs, 
as usual in certain studies. 
The paper has also studied the effectiveness of different 
levels of coordination between FCs. Communicative and 
non-communicative approaches have been compared, reveal-
ing that the performance of both schemes can be very close. 
However, when analyzing the dynamic response of the FC 
deployment under one scheme or the other, it has been ob-
served that the relation between the measurements period 
and the self-optimization period can considerably degrade 
the performance of the non-communicative scheme. On the 
other hand, the communicative scheme demonstrates a ro-
bust behavior in this respect. The main drawback of the 
communicative scheme is the need of designing signaling 
interfaces between FCs, and the additional signaling that 
communication between FCs adds to the system. Finally, it is 
worth remarking the low complexity of the proposed self-
optimization algorithms, showing that the simple inclusion 
of autonomous and adaptive mechanism could bring enorm-
ous performance benefits.
