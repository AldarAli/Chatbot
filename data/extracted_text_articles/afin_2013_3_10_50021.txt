Abstract—The cloud computing is an emerging new computing 
paradigm which provides high reliability, high availability, and 
QoS-guaranteed computing services. The reliability and 
stability of power supply is one of the most important factors 
in successful cloud computing. In this paper, we compare three 
different  configurations with imperfect coverage and standby 
switching failures based on the reliability and availability. The 
time-to-repair and the time-to-failure for each of the primary 
and 
warm 
standby 
components 
are 
assumed 
to 
be 
exponentially distributed. We derive the explicit expressions 
for the mean time-to-failure, MTTF, and steady-state 
availability, 
for 
three 
configurations 
and 
perform 
a 
comparative analysis. Three configurations are ranked based 
on MTTF, steady-state availability, and cost/benefit where 
benefit is either MTTF or steady-state availability.

Availability;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Uncertainty is one of the important issues in management 
decisions. Maintaining a high or required level of reliability 
and/or availability is especially essential in information 
industry, communication systems, power plants, etc. With 
the increasing demand for computing resources, the 
computing 
paradigm 
has 
evolved 
from 
stand-alone 
computing, distributed computing, grid computing, to cloud 
computing. Cloud computing hosts and delivers services 
over the Internet, i.e., information is processed on servers 
located in cloud data center and cached temporarily on 
clients via the Internet. A data center usually consists of 
thousands of servers that are organized in racks and 
interconnected through gigabit ethernet or other fabrics. Data 
center consumes a lot of electricity to maintain its normal 
operation. The power consumption breakdown of a data 
center includes servers and storage systems, power 
conditioning equipment, cooling and humidification systems, 
and networking equipment. In this paper, we discuss the 
optimal configuration of power electricity for data centers in 
terms of reliability and availability. Cao [4] first introduced 
reliability concept into a queueing system with a repairable 
service station which has exponentially distributed lifetime 
and generally distributed repair time. The concept of the 
standby switching failures in the reliability with standby 
system was first proposed by Lewis [6]. The concept of 
coverage and its effect on the reliability and/or availability 
model of a repairable system has been introduced by several 
authors such as Amari, et al. [1], Arnold [3], Dugan [5], 
Trivedi [7], and etc. Moreover, the status and trends of 
imperfect coverage models and its associated reliability 
analysis techniques were introduced in Amari, et al. [2].  
Wang and Chiu [9] investigated the cost benefit analysis of 
availability systems with warm standby units and imperfect 
coverage. Wang and Chen [8] performed comparative 
analysis of availability between three system with general 
repair times, reboot delay and switching failures. Wang et al. 
[11] studied the cost benefit analysis of series systems with 
warm standby components and general repair times. 
Recently, Wang et al. [10] performed comparisons of 
reliability and the availability between four systems with 
warm standby components, reboot delay and standby 
switching failures. 
The problem considered in this paper is more general 
than the works of Wang et al. [11] and Wang et al. [12]. We 
first systematically develop the explicit expressions for the 
i
MTTF  and
(
)
ATi
∞  to three configurations with imperfect 
coverage and standby switching failures. Next, efficient 
Maple computer programs are utilized to perform a 
parametric investigation. We provide extensive numerical 
results to study the effects of various values of system 
parameters to the cost/benefit ratios. Finally, we rank the 
configurations for the MTTF, the
(
)
TA ∞ , and the cost/benefit, 
based on specific values of distribution parameters, as well 
as of the costs of the components. 
II. 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
For the sake of discussion, we consider a data center 
require a 30MW power electricity, and assume that the 
electricity generation capacity of generators is available in 
units of 30MW, 15MW, and 10MW. To provide reliable and 
stable power supply, there are standby generators, and all 
active and standby generators are continuously monitored by 
a fault detecting device to identify if they fail or not. We also 
assume that standby generators are  allowed to fail while 
inactive before they are put into full operation. Each of the 
67

active components fails independently of the state of the 
others and has an exponential time-to-failure distribution 
with parameter λ . Whenever an active component (or warm 
standby component) fails, it may be immediately detected 
and located with a coverage probability c , and the failed 
component is instantly replaced by a warm standby 
component with switchover time 
1
β  if any standby is 
available. We now assume that each of the available standby 
component fails independently of the state of all the others 
and has an exponential time-to-failure distribution with 
parameter α ( 0
α
λ
<
<
). Moreover, we define the unsafe 
failure state of the system as any one of the breakdowns is 
not covered. We further assume that active-component 
failure (or standby-component failure) in the unsafe failure 
state is cleared by a reboot. Reboot delay is assumed to be 
exponentially distributed with parameter 
2
β  for an active 
component (or standby component). The system fails when 
the remaining electricity generation capacity is less than 
30MW. We define such situation as the state of safe failure. 
We assume that there is always the possibility of failures 
during the switching from standby state to active state. Let us 
assume that the switching component has a failure 
probability q . Active components and standby components 
are considered to be repairable. Whenever a primary 
component or a standby component fails, it is immediately 
repaired based on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) discipline. 
The time-to-repair for each of the primary and warm standby 
components are assumed to be exponentially distributed with 
parameter µ . Once a component is repaired, it is as good as 
new. 
Further, 
failure 
times 
and 
repair 
times are 
independently distributed random variables. 
We consider three configurations as follows: the first 
configuration consists of one 30 MW active component and 
one 30 MW warm standby component. The second 
configuration is composed of two 15 MW active components 
and one 15 MW warm standby component. We assume the 
standby component can replace either one of the initially 
working components in case of failure. The third 
configuration includes of three 10 MW active components 
and two 10 MW warm standby component.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS 
A. Comparison for the MTTF 
The main purpose of this section is to present specific 
numerical comparisons for the MTTF . Using an efficient 
Maple program, three configurations will be compared in 
terms of their 
i
MTTF (
i = 1, 2,3)
 with the following values: 
 
1 /
λ = 50 days,
1 /
200 days,
α =
 
and 1 /
µ = 2 days,
 
or 
λ = 0.02,
 
α = 0.005,
and 
µ = 0.5 .
 
We consider the following two cases to perform a 
comparison for the
i
MTTF of the configurations 1, 2, and 3. 
Case 1: We fix 
α =0.005
, 
µ=0.5

C. Comparison of all configurations based on their                 
cost/benefit ratios 
The cost (

are listed 
in the following:

for 
each 
configuration 
i (

. The results are depicted in Figures 4-7, 
respectively.  
Case 1: We fix 
α =0.0005

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show that the

observe from Figure 4 that the optimal configuration using 
the

MTTF value depends on the value of λ . When 
λ < 0.0574
, the optimal configuration is configuration 3, but 
when 
λ > 0.0574
, the optimal configuration is configuration 
1. One observes from Figure 5 that the optimal configuration 
using the

C

λ < 0.0418

when 0.0418

, the optimal configuration is 
configuration 3, and when

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we analyzed three different configurations  
with imperfect coverage and standby switching failures to 
study the cost/benefit analysis of three configurations under 
uncertainty. For each configuration, we present the explicit 
expressions for the 
ATi ( )
∞  and the MTTF. We rank three 
configurations based on the 
ATi ( )
∞  , the MTTF, and the 
cost/benefit where benefit is either steady-state availability 
or MTTF
