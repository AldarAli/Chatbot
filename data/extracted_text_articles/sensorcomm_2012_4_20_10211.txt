Abstract—RFID is a generic term for technologies which use 
RF waves to identify, track, or categorize any object. One of 
the research areas in RFID systems is a tag anti-collision 
protocol; how to reduce identification time with a given 
number of tags in the field of an RFID reader. There are two 
types of tag anti-collision protocols for RFID systems: tree 
based algorithms and slotted aloha based algorithms. Many 
anti-collision algorithms have been proposed in recent years, 
especially in tree based protocols. However, there still exist 
challenges on enhancing the system throughput and stability 
due to the underlying technologies having faced different 
limitation in system performance when network density is high. 
Recently, a Wrap-Around Scan (WAS) technique, which is a 
tree based approach, was proposed and aims to speedup tag 
identification in large scale RFID systems. The main idea of the 
Wrap-Around Scan is to limit the number of collisions by 
moving to next level as the number of collisions exceeds a 
predefined threshold. The WAS method indeed improves the 
efficiency in high density RFID systems. However, the reader 
using WAS scheme will spend some unnecessary queries for 
the idle response. In this paper, we proposed an intelligent 
wrap-around scan technique, which is called the iWAS scheme, 
to avoid those unnecessary queries. The simulation results 
show 
that 
the 
proposed 
techniques 
provide 
superior 
performance in high density environments. It is shown that the 
iWAS is effective in terms of increasing system throughput and 
minimizing identification delay.

 INTRODUCTION  
Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is an emerging 
technology that guarantees to advance modern industrial 
practices in object identification and tracking, asset 
management, and inventory control [14]. Recently, several 
identification systems such as barcodes and smart cards are 
incorporated for automatic identification and data collection. 
However, these systems have several limits in read rate, 
visibility, and contact. RFID systems are a matter of grave 
concern 
because 
they 
provide 
fast 
and 
reliable 
communication without requiring physical sight or touching 
between readers and tags. 
One of the areas of research is the speed with which a 
given number of tags in the field of RFID readers can be 
identified. For fast tag identification, anti-collision protocols, 
which reduce collisions and identify tags irrespective of 
occurring collisions, are required [6], [7]. There are two 
types of collisions: reader collisions and tag collisions. 
Reader collisions indicate that when neighboring readers 
inquire a tag concurrently, so the tag cannot respond its ID to 
the inquiries of the readers. These collision problems can be 
easily solved by detecting collisions and communicating 
with other readers. Tag collisions occur when multi tags try 
to respond to a reader simultaneously and cause the reader to 
identify no tag. For low-cost passive RFID tags, there is 
nothing to do except response to the inquiry of the reader. 
Thus, tag anti-collision protocols are necessary for 
improving the cognitive faculty of RFID systems. 
In general, the tag anti-collision techniques can be 
classified into two categories, aloha based and tree based 
protocols. Aloha-based approaches use time slot to reduce 
collision probability. Tags randomly select a particular slot 
in the time frame, load and transmit its identification to the 
reader. Once the transmission is collided, tags will repeatedly 
send its id in next interval of time to make sure its id is 
successfully recognized. Aloha based protocols can reduce 
the collision probability. However, they have the tag 
starvation problem that a particular tag may not be identified 
for a long time. For the consideration of performance, the tag 
collision rate is increased as the number of RFID tag 
increased, which may result a low tag recognition rate. 
The tree based schemes use a data structure similar to a 
binary search algorithm. An RFID reader consecutively 
communicates with tags by sending prefix codes based on 
the query tree data structure. Only tags in the reader’s 
interrogation zone and of which ID match the prefix respond. 
The reader can identify a tag if only one tag respond the 
inquiry. Otherwise the tags responses will be collided if 
multiple tags respond simultaneously. 
Although tree based protocols do not bring the tag 
starvation 
problem, 
but 
they 
have 
relatively 
long 
identification delay. Recently, a Wrap-Around Scan (WAS) 
technique was proposed and aiming to coordinate 
simultaneous communications in high density RFID 
environments, to speedup tag identification and to increase 
the overall read rate and throughput in large-scale RFID 
systems [15]. The main idea of the Wrap-Around Scan 
technique is to limit number of collisions during the 
identification phase. When number of collisions larger than 
the predefined acceptable ratio, it reveals that the density in 
RF field is too high. In order to minimize unnecessary 
inquiry, the prefix matching will be moved to lower level of 
the query tree, alleviating the collision problems. The 
method of setting collision bound indeed improves the 
efficiency of large-scale RFID tag identification. However, 
the reader using WAS scheme will spend some unnecessary 
queries for the idle response. In this paper, we proposed an

intelligent Wrap-Around Scan technique (iWAS) to avoid 
those unnecessary queries. To evaluate the performance of 
our proposed technique, we have implemented our proposed 
iWAS scheme along with previous proposed WAS method 
and the query tree protocol. The experimental results show 
that 
the 
proposed 
technique 
presents 
significant 
improvement in most circumstance. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Related work is discussed in Section II. In Section III, the 
tree based tag identification algorithm is introduced as 
preliminary of this study. In Section IV, our proposed query 
tree based algorithm, the intelligent Wrap-Around Scan 
(iWAS) is presented. Performance comparisons and analysis 
of the proposed technique will be given in Section V. Finally, 
in Section VI, some concluding remarks are made.

RELATED WORK 
Many research results for collision avoidance have been 
presented in literature. The existing tag identification 
approaches can be classified into two main categories, the 
Aloha-based [3], [4], [8], [11], [14] anti-collision scheme and 
the tree-based scheme [1], [7], [9], [13]. RFID readers in the 
former scheme create a frame with a certain number of time 
slots, and then add the frame length into the inquiry message 
sent to the tags in its vicinity. Tags response the interrogation 
based on a random time slot. Because collisions may happen 
at the time slot when two or more tag response 
simultaneously, making those tags could not be recognized. 
Therefore, the readers have to send inquiries contiguously 
until all tags are identified. As a result, Aloha-based scheme 
might have long processing latency in identifying large-scale 
RFID systems [4]. In [14], Vogt et al. investigated how to 
recognize 
multiple 
RFID 
tags 
within 
the 
reader’s 
interrogation ranges without knowing the number of tags in 
advance by using framed Aloha. A similar research is also 
presented in [11] by Zhen et al. In [3], Klair et al. also 
presented a detailed analytical methodology and an in-depth 
qualitative energy consumption analysis of pure and slotted 
Aloha 
anti-collision 
protocols. 
Another 
anti-collision 
algorithm called enhanced dynamic framed slotted aloha 
(EDFSA) is proposed in [5]. EDFSA estimates the number 
of unread tags first and adjusts the number of responding 
tags or the frame size to give the optimal system efficiency. 
In tree-based scheme, such as ABS [7], IBBT [2] and 
IQT [10], RFID readers split the set of tags into two subsets 
and labeled them by binary numbers. The reader repeats such 
process until each subset has only one tag. Thus the reader is 
able to identify all tags. The adaptive memoryless tag anti-
collision protocol proposed by Myung et al. [6] is an 
extended technique based on the query tree protocol. Choi et 
al. also proposed the IBBT (Improved Bit-by-bit Binary-Tree) 
algorithm [2] in Ubiquitous ID system and evaluate the 
performance along three other old schemes. The IQT 
protocol [10] is a similar work approach by exploiting 
specific prefix patterns in the tags to make the entire 
identification process. Recently, Zhou et al. [12] consider the 
problem of slotted scheduled access of RFID tags in a 
multiple reader environment. They developed centralized 
algorithms in a slotted time model to read all the tags. With 
the fact of NP-hard, they also designed approximation 
algorithms for the single channel and heuristic algorithms for 
the multiple channel cases. 
Although tree based schemes have advantage of 
implementation simplicity and better response time compare 
with the Aloha based ones, they still have challenges in 
decreasing the identification latency. In this paper, we 
present an enhanced tree based tag identification technique 
aims to coordinate simultaneous communications in large-
scale RFID systems, to speedup minimize tag identification 
latency and to increase the overall read rate and throughput. 
Simulation results show that our proposed technique 
outperforms previous techniques. 
III. 
TREE BASED TAG ANTI-COLLISION SCHEMES 
In this section, we present two tree based anti-collision 
techniques, namely the Query Tree algorithm (QTA) and the 
Wrap-Around Scan algorithm (WAS), that are most related 
to our work. 
A. Query Tree Algorithm 
The query tree algorithm (QT) uses binary splitting 
strategy to identify tags. A reader transmits the k-length 
prefix. Then tags send from (k + 1 )th bit to the end bit of 
tag IDs if the first k bits of tag IDs are the same as the 
prefix. Also, if the received tag IDs collide, the extended 
prefix attached ‘0’ or ‘1’ to the prefix is retransmitted. 
Furthermore, if there is no collision, the reader identifies 
one of the tags. Figure 1 shows an example of the query tree 
scheme. Table 1 summarizes the detail steps of 
communication between the reader and the tags with the 
example shown in Figure 1. 
B. Wrap-Around Scan algorithm 
In the environment with high tags density, collision may 
happen very frequently while using the query tree algorithm, 
and due to that, a lot of query time will be wasted. The main 
idea of Wrap-Around Scan algorithm is using a threshold 
jumping strategy in which a threshold of collisions is mainly 
used as the criterion of moving the identification process to 
the next level of a query tree. By using the collision 
threshold, when the collisions happen frequently in a level, 
the corresponding level of the query tree will be jumping 
over. As shown in Figure 2, when the number of collision 
exceeds the predefined threshold, prefix matching at the 
present level will be skipped in order to save unnecessary 
prefix inquires for the remaining part at the same level. 
Through the process, the number of inquiry message could 
be significantly reduced. The collision threshold in Wrap-
Around Scan technique is set to 2I/M, where I denotes the 
level in the query tree and M is a pre-defined constant.  
Let us use an example to demonstrate the WAS scheme. 
Figure 3 shows an example of an RFID network having 6 
tags with 4-bits id length using WAS with M = 3. The WAS 
scans the query tree from left to right in level 1, the reverse 
in level 2, and reverse again in level 3, and so on. Since M = 
3, the threshold of collisions are 1, 2 and 3 in level 1, level 2 
and level 3, respectively. The only one collision happened in

level 1 is node 0, the two collision nodes appeared in level 2 
are nodes 10 and 11; while the three collision nodes in level 
3 are happened at nodes 011, 101 and 110 in order. Table 2 
summarizes the detail steps of communication between the 
reader and the tags with the example shown in Figure 3.

THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 
Recall that, in WAS technique, the identification of tags 
in the right sub-tree could be advanced by reversing the 
direction of scan in each level alternatively. Figure 4 
demonstrates the idea of wrap-around scan. The level 
ordered scans start from left to right in all “odd” (or even) 
levels and starts from right to left in all “even” (or odd) 
levels. Using wrap-around scan, the amount of prefix 
inquiries is expected to be decreased as the advance findings 
of the information of no response / collisions in the query 
tree could be in a balanced way. In WAS approach, jumping 
will reduce the number of collisions in a level. However, it 
will also cause unnecessary inquiry in the next level since 
some of inquires could be omitted once the status of the 
corresponding upper level is known. We describe our idea in 
the following sections.

In query tree algorithm, every time when collision 
happened, the reader will add one bit for prefix matching at 
next level. In such way, it may waste too much time in 
scanning the entire binary tree. The main idea of our 
proposed technique is that, instead of adding one bit for 
prefix matching at next level as collision occurred in query 
tree algorithm, we first analyze the possible ways for causing 
the collision and take appropriate actions at next level. We 
study the relationship for a collision parent node and its two 
child nodes. In our observation, there are four possible ways 
causing the collision parent node: 1) two collision child 
nodes, 2) one collision child node and the other identifiable 
(success) child node, 3) one collision child node and the 
other idle child node, and 4) two identifiable (success) child 
nodes. Figure 4 shows the four possible cases for a collision.

Figure 4. 
The four possible cases for a collision. 
Based on the relationship between a collision parent node 
and its two child nodes, we observe that cases (3) and (4) can 
be used as a prior knowledge for deciding the status of a 
child node when the status of the sibling for the child node is 
known. For example, in case (3), once the result of the prefix 
matching is known to be idle, the prefix matching will be 
unnecessary for the sibling node since the status of their 
parent node is collided and as a result, the status of sibling 
node will be collided too. Another observation is that if a 
collision occurred at level (n-1), then, as we described in 
case (4), the two child nodes at level n must be identified. 
Combining the WAS algorithm with the enhancement 
technique, we develop an enhanced WAS algorithm with 
prior knowledge, called the intelligent Wrap-Around Scan 
(iWAS) algorithm to reduce the query time in identification 
process. Figure 5 shows an example to illustrate the 
performance of proposed iWAS technique. Table 3 
summarizes the detail steps of communication between the 
reader and the tags with the example of Figure 5. As shown 
in Table 3, 6 tags can be identified in 9 steps by using iWAS 
algorithm while using original WAS technique, it will take 
18 steps to identify 6 tags. It should be noticed that when the 
reader broadcasts prefix bit string 010 to tags, there is no 
response from tags since no tags match 010 in their ids. At 
this moment, the reader is aware that nodes 000, 001 and 010 
are all in idle state and node 0 is in collision state. Thus, the 
reader can conclude that node 011 should be in collision state. 
As a result, tags A and B can be identified according to case 
(4). Similarly, as node 100 is in idle state, the reader is aware 
that node 10 is in collision state. Thus, node 101 can be 
recognized as in collision state. As a result, tags C and D can 
be identified at this moment. Therefore, the proposed iWAS 
technique can significantly reduce the query time. Simulation 
results show that our proposed iWAS algorithm outperforms 
the original WAS algorithm in many situations. We evaluate 
the performance in the following section.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, 
we have implemented the iWAS scheme along with the 
query tree protocol (QT) and Wrap-Around Scan scheme 
(WAS). Figure 6 compares the number of inquires to identify 
different number of RFID tags. In this experiment, the tag id 
is set 8 bits length and density = 10% means that there are 28 
 10% = 26 tags, and so on. All tags are randomly generated 
in a uniform distribution manner. As a result, a balance tree 
is generated as entitled in the figure. In this experiment, the 
threshold value M is set 3. As shown in Figure 6, the 
proposed technique iWAS can reduce the amount of inquiry 
messages. As we expected, the iWAS outperforms both the 
WAS and QT techniques. When network density increasing, 
the 
proposed 
iWAS 
method 
presents 
significant 
improvements to the traditional query tree protocol and 
WAS method.  
 
 
Figure 6. 
Performance comparison of the iWAS, WAS and QT with 8 bits 
RFID tags. 
Figure 7 uses the same configuration as that of Figure 6 
except the length of tag ID is set 16 bits. The number of tags 
in this experiment is set from 216  10% = 6554 to 216  
100%  = 65536. This experiment has similar observations as 
those of Figure 6. The proposed iWAS has better 
performance compare to the WAS and QT in terms of the 
inquiry message. It should be noticed that the amount of 
inquiry messages of proposed iWAS method is almost the 
same when the network density exceeds 70%. This is due to 
that when the network density is high, the balance tree is 
almost full. As a result, the reader can obtain the collision 
state in the same level during the identification process of 
our proposed iWAS method. Therefore, the amount of 
inquiry message is almost the same when network density is 
high. 
 
Figure 7. 
Performance comparison of the iWAS, WAS and QT with 16 
bits RFID tags. 
The last experiment was conducted with different 
distribution of ids among tags. The term Tree Balance Factor 
(TBF) defined in Figure 8 is used to indicate the percentage 
of tags distribution in left sub-tree and right sub-tree of a 
query tree. TBF = 10% means that number of tags in left 
sub-tree and right sub-tree are with the ration 1:9, TBF = 
20% represents the number of tags in left sub-tree and right 
sub-tree are with the ration 2:8, and so on. As a result, an 
imbalance tree is generated as entitle in the figure. This 
experiment varies the tree balance factor from 10% which 
means an imbalance tree, to 50% which reflects a balance 
tree. The density is set 80% in the experiment. From the 
experimental results, the iWAS outperforms the WAS and 
the query tree methods in both imbalance and balance 
distributions.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
With the emergence of wireless RFID technologies, 
identifying high density RFID tags is a crucial task in 
developing large scale RFID systems. In this paper, we have 
presented an enhanced tree-based tag identification 
technique for minimizing tag identification cost. By using a 
prior knowledge, many unnecessary inquires can be 
reduced. Together with the Wrap-Around Scan technique 
(WAS), the efficiency of tag identification can be 
significantly improved. To evaluate the performance of 
proposed techniques, we have implemented the iWAS 
technique along with the WAS and the query tree protocol 
(QT). The experimental results show that the proposed 
technique provides considerable improvements on the 
latency of tag identification. It is also shown that the iWAS 
is effective in terms of increasing system throughput and 
efficiency. It remains challenging, however, to find an 
optimal approach that would use least prior knowledge to 
reduce unnecessary inquires as many as possible.
