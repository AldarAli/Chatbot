Abstract— Metropolitan ring networks are usually used to 
connect the high speed backbone networks with the high speed 
access networks. Until now, metropolitan networks and access 
networks are gained much attention of researchers just as in 
separate direction. In this work, we study an interconnected 
Multi-Ring Network (MRN) architecture in which 
a 
Metropolitan Access (MA) Ring is interconnected by a 
Metropolitan Core (MC) Ring via a Hub Node who is in charge 
of the synchronization between them. The synchronization in 
this architecture is the major problem. To solve this problem, 
we propose a new mechanism called Common-Used Timer 
Mechanism (CUTM) inspired from CoS-Upgrade Mechanism 
(CUM) to create well filled optical packets in the hub. CUTM 
is developed and also integrated as a module to the software 
Network Simulator 2 (NS2), to simulate the behavior of the 
MRN considered. We compare the performance of this 
mechanism with the opportunistic one. The results have shown 
that, compared to existing solutions, the CUTM enhances the 
network throughput, optimizes the use of resources, and also 
offers a solution to the synchronization problem.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
Optical technology is being developed more and more in 
all levels of networks. It led the innovation of broadband 
networks. Passive Optical Networks (PON) have attracted 
much attention of researchers because it is an excellent 
solution for low cost broadband services. The next 
generation of Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) requires 
flexible, scalable and manageable architectures to provide 
different type of services to their customers at the access or 
backbone 
networks. 
With 
passive 
devices 
on 
the 
transmission line signal, it is easy to build and maintain the 
PON. So PON becomes the first choice for metropolitan area 
network. 
Metropolitan ring networks are generally used to connect 
the high speed backbone networks with the high speed 
access networks. The metro rings can be interconnected 
transparently through a single access node (Hub node) or 
multiple access nodes. Current metro networks are typically 
SONET/SDH-over-WDM rings which carry the huge 
amount of bursty data traffic. The metro core and regional 
networks are normally both 2-fiber rings. A fiber failure in a 
metro access ring does not affect the traffic in the core and 
other access rings. The network thus becomes more reliable. 
Dual Bus Optical Ring Network (DBORN) has been 
proposed as one of the first passive architecture, known for 
the metropolitan networks.   However, new transparent 
optical 
network 
providing 
packet-level 
granularity 
architectures have been proposed and studied called 
ECOFRAME. This architecture is studied and a prototype is 
developed as for next generation of MAN in the 
ANR/ECOFRAME 
(France) 
project. 
Its 
important 
characteristic is that it can be used as MA and/or MC 
Network. Until now, metropolitan networks and access 
networks are gained much attention of researchers in 
separate direction. Recently, the end-to-end metropolitan 
performance of a multi-ring architecture (in which MANs 
are interconnected by a metropolitan core network) has been 
investigated [1]. We consider a multi-ring architecture, in 
which MANs are interconnected by MC Network. The 
interconnection of MC and MA networks is made via Hub 
node that is in charge of the synchronization of the two ring 
networks.  Other functions to be operated by the hub are 
similar to those of access node.  
Some works have presented new architectures to 
integrate in a transparent way metro-access and metro-core 
ring networks [2]. Other works [3] have studied the design 
and the development of new devices to interconnect Metro 
Access and Metro Core Ring networks. However, the 
synchronization problem between the networks has been 
neglected and a major research opportunity exists in this 
sense. Several mechanisms to create optical packets that 
improve the performance of the multi-ring network have 
been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a 
new mechanism CUTM to create optical packets well filled 
and we compare the results obtained with the well known 
“opportunistic” mechanism in terms of waiting time, end to 
end delay, filling ratio, and jitter.   
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, selected Metro Access and Metro Core architectures have 
been summarized. In Section III the studied architecture is 
presented. In Section IV, our proposed mechanism CUTM is 
introduced. In Section V, our simulation scenario is 
described and in Section VI the simulation results are 
presented. Finally, we conclude our work.

 METRO ACCESS AND METRO CORE ARCHITECTURES 
According to the physical distribution of the network 
components, the bus, star and ring topologies can be 
implemented. Ring topologies have been widely adopted and 
studied for MAN because it is easy to construct and maintain 
with low cost, and bidirectional rings inherently provide fast 
restoration. Statistical multiplexing of data traffic flowing 
from different nodes over the shared medium provides 
efficient utilization of optical fibers. Some optical MANs in 
ring topologies are: Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), DBORN, 
ECOFRAME. DBORN [4][5] uses a double bus WDM rings 
topology with spectral separation and it functions in the 
asynchronous mode. This topology consists of two 
unidirectional buses: upstream and downstream. In the 
upstream bus, access nodes share a common transmission 
medium for carrying their traffic to a centralized node (hub) 
while the downstream bus carries traffic from Hub node to 
all access nodes. For the cost-effective solution, each ring 
node possesses passive components; lead in to the fact that 
they can not drop any transit packets in upstream line. 
Although of its simplicity, this architecture has several 
drawbacks as positional priority, fairness issues and 
bandwidth fragmentation. In our work we use synchronous 
DBORN version (slotted ring, fixed size packet) as a MA 
ring. Compared to the previously mentioned architecture, 
ECOFRAME [6] pays special attention to the deployment of 
optical technologies "low cost" to ensure good network 
performance while remaining competitive with electronic 
technology in terms of cost, service transparency and 
modularity. ECOFRAME ring uses fixed optical packet size, 
separate data and control channels and it can be used as MA 
and MC ring. In our work, ECOFRAME is used as a MC 
network. 
III. 
STUDIED ARCHITECTURE 
In this section, we present an architecture, which is 
composed of two segments: Access Network and Core 
Network (Fig. 1). For the access network synchronous 
DBORN architecture is considered and for core network 
ECOFRAME architecture. The interconnection is made via a 
hub node.  
We distinguish two traffic flows: 1) the traffic flowing 
from the access network to the core network through the hub, 
and 2) the traffic flow circulating in the core network.  In an 
access node of MA, the electronic packets are encapsulated 
in optical packets and transported through the hub. In the hub 
O/E/O converter is used to build new optical packets fill well 
coming from different nodes and going to same destination. 
These packets are stored in the queue in the hub.  Hub 
architecture is presented in Fig; 2. It is composed of two 
parts: electronic part and optical part. In the electronic part, 
the packets are converted and stored in the buffer before 
processing. In optical part, it is used FDL.  
One of the roles of Hub is to create new optical packets 
well filled. The creation of new optical packets can be made 
using three mechanisms: 1) mutual combination (electronic 
packets coming from different access nodes can be combined  
Figure 1.  Networks Interconnection 
together), 2) local combination (combined with local 
electronic packets of the hub) and 3) total combination (two 
combinations mentioned), totally according to class of 
service. According to the access control mechanism used in 
the Hub, the optical packets coming from MA can be placed 
directly in the optical buffers (to be ready to be routed 
through the Hub) or they are converted in electronic packets 
by O/E converter and wait in the electronic buffer 
corresponding to their CoS until timer is expired and new 
timer is reset. New optical packets are created using a packet 
creation mechanism and are sent to the core network.  
 
Figure 2.  Architecture of Hub 
We present a new packet creation mechanism in the 
Section IV. At the Hub node, the packets in transit in the 
core network have higher priority than traffic of access 
network; therefore, the E/O converter is performed if there is 
no packet in the optical FDL. The associated times to the 
creation process are specified in Fig. 3. One of the problems 
of interconnection between the rings is the synchronization 
of timer between them. Each ring is already synchronized 
but each one has different size of slot time and optical 
packet. Therefore, it is needed to synchronize data inputs and 
outputs at the Hub.

Figure 3.  Times for  the Optical Packet Creation Process 
The synchronization problem is solved using electronic 
buffers in the hub. Packet creating process introduces the 
delay which helps to synchronize the two rings. Fig. 3 shows 
the transmission time slot of two rings with different sizes. 
L1 is the transmission time of a packet in the optical metro 
access and L2 corresponds to the transmission time of a 
packet in the core network. The correlation of the variables 
L1 and L2, and synchronization lag ∆t affect the network 
performance.

IV. 
CUTM MECHANISM 
Some mechanisms have been proposed in literature to 
decide the time to create optical packets.  A well known 
scheme is the opportunistic mechanism [6], this mechanism  
is simple: if a slot in transit is free, the optical packet is 
built and transmitted on the ring.  The purpose of this 
mechanism is to reduce the load of the hub and use fewer 
resources. However, other mechanisms have been developed 
to optimize the optical packet filling. We proposed a 
mechanism [1], called CoS-Upgrade mechanism (CUM), to 
synchronize the traffics in the access nodes. This mechanism 
can be used not only for the access nodes (in the access 
network and core network) but also for the Hub to solve the 
problem of creating  fixed size optical packet,  so it uses 
timers in deciding when the optical packet is constructed. 
CUM mechanism has many advantages but also some 
limitations: 1) it uses several timers and buffers, 2) the hub 
will be over loaded when all timers are running, and 3) when 
the order of packets is changed building the packet at the 
receiver side is complicated. To improve the limitations of 
CUM, we propose Common-Used Timer Mechanism 
(CUTM), which uses a single timer for all classes of service. 
The principal of CUTM is shown in Fig. 5. CUTM principal 
corresponds to the creation process descript before in this 
Section, according to the Hub function. To use CUTM, we 
need a single buffer to hold the optical packets. 
 
V. 
STUDIED SCENARIOS 
The traffic flow in network is shown in Fig. 1. All the 
access nodes in the first ring will send the data to the node 16 
(the last node). In the second ring network, there are 2 types 
of traffic flow: one coming from the access network and one 
is the local traffic (core network). So in each link connect 2 
core nodes, there are 8 traffic flow from access network and 
2 local traffics from other core nodes. The traffic in second 
network is symmetric. We consider 8 classes of service for 
electronic packets and 4 CoS for optical packets with 
different traffic sources models and packet sizes (Table I).

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this work, several performance criteria for the given 
architecture are evaluated by simulation using NS2 tool 
and  the results are presented in terms of the waiting time 
in the hub, end to end delay, throughput, jitter and filling 
ratio, loss rate at node 16. Firstly, we fix the value of ∆t = 
1µs and study the interaction of L1 and L2 depending on 
the bandwidth and packet size in each network. CUTM 
uses a timer equal to 100µs. The results in Fig. 6 show the 
jitter for the 3 considered scenarios at node 16, both 
mechanisms ensure the jitter condition for data flow 
specified on Table III.

Fig. 7 shows the waiting time in hub, the average 
waiting time of packets in the electronic buffers with 
opportunistic mechanism is smaller than that of the 
CUTM. Based on these results we can say that CUTM is 
independent of L1&L2 correlation but depends on the 
capacity of the MC. By using opportunistic mechanism, 
the performance of hub does not depend on the capacity of 
MC; but it is sensitive to the correlation of L1 and L2.

Fig. 8 shows the End to End delay for both

The scenario 3 results show that the opportunistic 
mechanism uses more metro core bandwidth than CUTM, 
also that there is not loss at the hub and the nodes in the 
MC. To evaluate the loss rate we change the scenario 3 
parameters. We increase the load of MA from 60% to 
70%. With this change, we have the 3-1 scenario with MA 
load =70% ~ 8Gb/s, MC load = 70% ~ 28Gb/s, it means a 
total load = 35Gb/s ~ 87.5%@40Gb/s. The results in Fig. 
11 show that for nodes 9 to 16 there is the loss of 
electronic packets. These nodes lack the bandwidth to send 
local traffic. The loss rate is zero at node 16 because node 
16 is the destination of data flows from the Metro Access. 
So the loss rate at node 9 is higher than at node 10. 
Figure 11.  Loss rate for scenario 3-1. 
The impact of ∆t is analyzed in varying it from 1µs to 
21µs (20µs = 2 x L2) on the performance of network and 
on hub. The Fig. 12 shows that the value of ∆t does not 
significant impact on the network performance. The results 
are the same with the opportunistic mechanism.  
Our results show that the opportunistic mechanism is 
better than CUTM. However, the filling ratio of CUTM is 
better than the opportunistic mechanism. Consequently 
CUTM mechanism saves more bandwidth than the 
opportunistic mechanism and provides good packet filling 
ratio.  
 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We have studied and analyzed the performance of 
interconnected MAN rings (MA and MC) and especially 
the synchronization problem between them. Performance 
comparison of two mechanisms: Opportunistic and CUTM 
has been presented. CUTM offers a solution to solve the 
problem of synchronization and provides good network 
utilization. CUTM is independent of the correlation 
between L1&L2, but depends on the core network 
capacity.  Performance of opportunistic mechanism does 
not depend on core network capacity but it is sensitive to 
the correlation of L1 and L2. There is not a real impact of 
∆t on the network performance, variation in waiting time 
at hub is very small. We wish to study the impact ∆t on the 
performance with other traffic models.
