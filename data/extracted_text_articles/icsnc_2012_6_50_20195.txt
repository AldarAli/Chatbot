Abstract—This article presents a study relative to the influence 
that demographic and geographic conditions have on the 
economics of fiber optic telecommunications access networks. 
This approach differs from other studies by merging classical 
techno-economic 
evaluation 
methods 
with 
geographic 
engineering tools and models. This analysis is part of a project 
to identify the costs of all type of utilities´ infra-structures as a 
function of the degree of urban dispersion. The work presented 
in this paper is the quantification of a PON network using an 
approach that combines fiber optics engineering and 
deployment with geographic tools. 
Keywords- GPON techno-economics; access network fiber 
deployment; urban dispersion; local scale; utilities. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Today´s cities are quite different from the past. The 
continuous 
geographical 
expansion 
of 
the 
utilities’ 
infrastructures such as the water, the natural gas, the 
sewerage system, the electricity and the telecommunications 
[1] contributes to a generalized increasing of the quality of 
life and is reflected in the organization and urbanizations of 
the population´s settlements. In consequence from the 
building compactness and continuity of the old city, raises a 
new type of fragmented and spread urbanism.  
But, if for most of the infrastructures it is likely to 
“follow” the inhabited settlements based on municipals 
master 
plans, 
the 
classic 
approach 
of 
the 
telecommunications 
operator’s 
is 
to 
focused 
their 
deployment plans on the urban administrative limits, where 
is forecast a guaranteed financial return. 
In parallel, the growth of the telecommunications 
demand requires faster and wider broadband to each 
house/person leading towards a new global Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT) era. The fact that the 
United Nations (UN) considered the telecommunications 
broadband access an universal right [2], has increased the 
pressure to expand the new generation telecommunication 
infrastructures, namely the high speed optical networks, to 
all type of municipal arrangements [3]. Nowadays, the main 
constrains for the deployment of those types of networks is 
not so much the technology maturity but the civil work´s 
inherent costs [4] mainly in rural and exurban scattered 
zones.  
The research described in this paper is focusing in the 
exurban areas where the typical profile is people with higher 
college education level than closer-in suburbs, people that 
migrate to center city during the day for work, and return 
home at night, far from the crowd but with interest in being 
“always on line”. A correct approach to the delimitation of 
the extended city and the urban dispersion borders can lead 
to a potential new planning area and profitable business 
plan, by integrating a set of methodological phases from the 
techno-economic analysis to the geographical modeling.  
Considering this, the main objective of the paper is the 
evaluation of the overall costs when comparing different 
forms of habitat (concentrated and dispersed) at the local 
scale at a brownfield gigabit passive optical network 
(GPON).  
This paper is divided as follows: Section I defines the 
context of the paper. Section II defines the technological 
scenarios´ of the study. It is dedicated to the description of 
the optical access network architecture and respective 
components’ cost assumptions. Section III describes a 
method to extract a geographical model from real data of 
suburban settlements of typical Portuguese medium sized 
cities. Section IV presents the forecast results of a gigabit 
passive optical network, GPON network in both urban and 
suburban environments obtained by applying the extracted 
model at the local scale to a real city. Finally, a summary is 
presented. 
II. 
INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS 
In the telecommunication world there are several 
possibilities to reach each subscriber. They can be reached 
either individually at their mobile phones or at each one´s 
house by cable (in this paper, each house/door will be 
referred as Dwelling Unit, DU).  
The access technology elected for this study was the 
GPON. The reasons that lead to the choice of an optical 
network as the high speed provider were the wider spread of 
the other most common solution, as described next and also 
the existence of ancient technologies that provide 
infrastructures that can be shared and consequently reducing 
the costs for the migration: 
 Global access to the voice service is provided on the 
existence of the universal service (US) for plain old 
157

telephone service (POTS) and low debt internet 
based on Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line 
(ADSL), [5-7]; 
 The broadcast television is also considered universal 
(e.g. more than 99.5% of the Portuguese population 
own at least one TV set [8] and 75% more than two); 
 The mobile wireless subscriber penetration for both 
voice and data, in the context of the urban dispersion, 
can be considered not far from 100% (e.g. In 
Portugal reaches 120% [9]); 
There is already in the field a fixed subterranean 
infrastructure that can be shared with other technologies and 
suppliers [10], assuming a share percentage of ducts around 
50% and it is considered that most of the traditional urban 
and suburban areas already have a digital subscriber line 
(DSL) infra-structure and consequently at least one street 
cabinet or manhole already exists per neighborhood. 
As the main focus in this work is the comparison of the 
local scale network, all the cost calculation will focus on the 
shared neighborhood infrastructure and all the access 
network´s 
segments 
shared 
among 
the 
several 
neighborhoods, such as the central office (CO), are excluded 
at this point. It is also assumed that 100% of the buildings, 
houses, schools and other institutions, under the limits of the 
urban dispersion occupation, will be equipped with optical 
fiber. 
A. GPON Architecture at the Local Scale 
Most logical architectures for the telecommunications 
networks are based around a system of three sets of layers. 
A common layer description is composed by: Core, Access 
and Client networks, see Figure 1.  
The core network gives internetwork connectivity and 
interoperates with the “cloud” and other networks. The 
client network is the segment directly connected to the client 
through an electronic device depending of the technology 
such as a mobile phone, a TV set, a modem or a telephone, 
among others. The access network is the layer that connects 
both extremities segments and is the layer that is most often 
considered to the cost evaluation of a telecommunication´s 
network deployment, [11-13].  
A fiber optical network based on a fiber to the home or 
building architecture (GPON FTTH/B) can be deployed in 
many different ways depending number of existing houses, 
the number of clients; the environment topology; streets 
rearrangement and equipment available or chosen by the 
engineer. 
In 
this 
particularly 
study, 
the 
network 
infrastructure is based on manholes, trenching ducts, or mast 
for aerial support of the fiber. This paper presents a 
redefinition of the standard concept, with a new vision of 
the access network infrastructure. 
The local scale infrastructure: that is the part of the 
access network segment that is serving directly the 
neighborhood here referred as the base land unit, BLU. It 
excludes the Central Office. And the global access 
infrastructure is the network segment that is serving a wider 
territorial unit, as the whole city. It includes the core 
network and parts of the access networks that connects 
several neighborhoods or BLU´s, see Figure 1. 
At this stage, it should point out the infrastructure costs 
of the global access infrastructure will be disregarded, not 
because they are irrelevant but due to the local scale 
perspective the global costs are equal in all cases. It is 
defined that all existing houses or public buildings are being 
deployed with fiber so the number of clients is equal to the 
number of existing “doors” or DU. It is also stated that each 
house receives 1 optical fiber. 
Moreover, we also consider a fixed default architecture 
configuration so that the dispersion scenarios could be 
comparable. The FTTH/B GPON architecture chosen was 
based on the following considerations. 
 In GPON, the maximum differential fiber distance is 
20 km  so the total dimension from the CO to the 
client cannot exceed 20Km [14]; 
 The optical link budget must safeguard a positive 
system margin ; 
 It is expected that in average the length (L) of each 
fiber segment obeys the rule: L1<L2<L3 , see Figure 
1; 
 There is only one stage of passive optical splitters to 
distribute the fiber to each customer; 
 The splitting ratio is fixed to 1:32 for all splitters; 
 There can be more than one flexibility point (FP), 
depending of the neighborhood geometry. 
B. Cost Analysis Method 
The initial objective of this study is to obtain the cost 
comparison between several scenarios for the dispersive 
urban occupation, from the society point of view, as a 
whole. Any allocation or apportionment of costs between 
the telecommunication players will not be considered such 
as: service providers, infrastructure owners, state or 
subscribers. Likewise, the existence of taxes or any forms of 
payment mechanisms will also not be considered. 
 
Figure 1. Telecommunication networks layers comparison with local 
scale concept. 
The costs are reported in a reference period of 30 years. 
This option enables a cost / benefit analysis, since it seems 
reasonable with such time horizon to affect also the value of 
the buildings, in fact, from there on, the building requires 
maintenance work / reconstruction of very significant costs. 
The cost of any infrastructure´s component or equipment 
(CT) is the sum of the Investment Cost (IC) and the 
Maintenance Costs (MC) in the fixed 30 year period (1). 
CT (30years) =IC+MC 
 
 
 (1) 
For each component or equipment, the IC includes the 
civil works costs plus the acquisition and installation costs 
of the equipment. To calculate it, it is necessary to adopt a 
financial annual discount rate (FDR), that according to the 
158

ICSNC 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications

European Commission (EC) should be FDR=5%, [12]. IC 
can then be written for a 30 year period. It is taken into 
account for each component, the life time, V, and the need 
for its replacement.  
The calculation of the number of investments for each 
component is given by K+1, where K is an artifice for non-
multiple divisions and equals abs(the roundup of 30/V-1). 
The first parcel of (2) reflects the sum of the initial 
investments needed for a certain component, depending on 
its time life. Each year, the initial component cost (Ci) is 
affected by the FDR at the calculation year (n.V). 
Sometimes, the component lifetime (V) can go beyond 
the 30 year assumed project life time, and because of that, in 
the second parcel of (2) is subtracted the portion of the 
investment corresponding to that differential, affected by the 
FDR at year 30.

Where Ci is the initial investment at year 0, V is the 
lifetime in years, K=abs (roundup (30/V-1; 0)) and 
FDR=0,05.  
The maintenance costs are related to the energy 
consumption, periodical inspections and rents. It can be 
expressed based on the annual maintenance costs Cm and the 
FDR (5%), (3). Usually, this coefficient is described as a 
percentage of IC.

C. GPON Investment and Expenses 
The equipment prices are reported to the year 2010 and 
are based on data from the components suppliers found on 
the web. Whenever is possible the calculations are presented 
as a function of € per DU and if it is not possible is 
presented as € per meter. It is also assumed that 1 DU 
corresponds to 2.4 inhabitants, [15].  
All the equipments and components are related to Figure 
1. 
1) Fibers (fo): The fiber segments are optical cables that 
contain several optical fibers (fo) namely groups of 288fo, 
48fo or 24fo, can be buried in ducts or aerial supported on 
masts.  In the case of buried fiber deployment, the value of 
civil works and ducts is assumed to be half the real price. 
This is due to the fact that it is assumed that at least 50% of 
the trenches already exist and are shared. In the case of the 
aerial deployment it is assumed that each mast height is 
around 8 m and the distance between masts is typically 50m. 
If there is more than one flexibility point, FP, the L3 
segment can be divided in smaller cable slots between FP´s, 
named L3.1 and L3.2 (from the client to the core). At L3.1 
segment a 24fo cable is considered, and at L3.2 segment is 
assumed to have a 48fo cable. The final cable segment, L1, 
could be inexistent if the ODP is in the building façade. If 
the ODP is shared among several single houses L1 can be 
deployed either underground or aerial, unless the inter-
house distance is economically impracticable, as will be 
discussed in Section IV.  
Tables I and II presents the CAPEX and OPEX of the 
different fiber segments for the different types of 
deployment considered.

2) Flexibility points (FP):  
The flexibility points, usually in manholes, are used to 
separate physically the cable in the hub corners and street 
cross points. They are define as 1:N type, depending on the 
number of cables they aggregate in one cable. In this study, 
FP1 is type 1:2 that means that receives 2 L3.1. cable 
segments from the splitters and join them into 1 cable of 
48fo (L3.2). Then in 1:6 type, FP2, the process repeats and 
FP2 ends with 6*48=288cable (L4) of 48fo entering the CO.

splitters was assumed. From the central office and after the 
flexibility points, each 1:32 type splitter receives a 24fo 
cable and divide each fiber in 32 fibers grouped in cables of 
24fo. In this scenario, each splitter was able to serve 788 
DU´s, if all the fibers were used for clients, however a 
percentage is reserved to network maintaince.

an infrastructure component which main function is to 
connect the distribution network to the client and it may be 
mounted either indoor or outdoor. Each ODP receives a 
24fo cable. In this study, it is assumed that there are no 
splitters inside the ODP and 4 of the 24 fibers are reserved 
for the telecommunications operator’s maintenance issues. 
Each ODP is shared among an integer number of buildings 
or houses up to a certain inter-house distance. Table V

URBAN DISPERSION IDENTIFICATION METHODOLOGY 
The study of urban dispersion on a local scale requires 
the adoption of operational concepts. This research uses the 
notion of "Base Land Unit" (BLU), which represents a piece 
of land for experimental studies [16], which will be used to 
characterize the land occupation by defining a BLU ranking. 
The recognition of BLU is more difficult in urban territories 
because its fragmentary and dispersive expansion dynamics 
are not consistent with the administrative limits. 
The research project’s case studies are two typical 
medium European types of cities. One type which is 
generally regarded as a concentrated city that developed 
(more or less) homogeneously around a nuclear old city and 
another type that derived from the same type of origin but 
for several factor grew in such a way that is usually 
associated to a more dispersed or diffused territory.  
A. Local Scale BLU Modeling 
The first approach of the land unit, LU characterization 
consists on the analysis of digital aerial photos to delimit the 
borders of the extended city, based on the maximum 
distances between buildings. This digital method typifies the 
building agglomeration in three types: continuous, dispersed 
and rarefied. 
The Base Land Unit, BLU, concept integrates and 
almost coincides with other well-known territorial units, 
namely the neighborhood in its everyday meaning. The 
BLU concept differs from the neighborhood as it does not 
necessarily refer to an exclusively residential area – it may 
also encompass central or industrial areas, techno-centers, a 
dispersed settlement area or even an agricultural and/or 
forested area within the extended city. 
In this study, with the focus on the local scale, a base 
land unit for the concentrated occupation with no more than 
3000 residents and corresponding to 1200 DU´s is 
considered. The DU’s are most of them buildings but also 
single houses; it also includes some green plazas and the 
existence of public equipments as schools, commercial 
zones and hospitals in a total of 133 DU´s. 
The geographic applied method identified attributes to 
differentiate standard BLU´s scenarios to work with, [17] as 
building aggregation in city blocks or one-to-one; usage as 
uni/bi-functional versus multi-functional buildings and 
distance to the public equipments and commerce, among 
others. 
The observation and quantification of these attributes 
lead to a classification of the Concentrate BLU in two main 
groups: Classic and Modernist, with each one of these 
classifications further divided in uni/bi-functional or multi-
functional building aggregation leading to 4 types of 
scenarios [16]. The dispersed urbanization characterization 
is followed by several defined attributes that combined can 
formulate 9 different types of scenarios [17]. Only the three 
most suitable were chosen to the reality in study. These 
environments are characterized by groups of edifications as: 
linear and continuous (LC), scatter and occasional (SO) and 
uniform and occasional (UO).  
As an example, Figure 3 illustrates the final aspect of the 
base land unit, concentrated classic and dispersed uniform 
and 
occasional

the

attributes 
manipulation. For the dispersed BLU occupation, it was 
defined an universe of 1000 inhabitants corresponding to 
400 DU´s. For this type, of BLU specific taxonomy and 
adapted attributes were tested. The attributes adopted

include the linear density (LD) indicator which can be 
expressed by the number of houses per linear track. Its 
results were compared with the real environment and as a 
consequence a LD grade scale was defined. One of the 
conclusions of this indicator´s reading is that is also 
applicable to all type of BLUs and not only to the dispersion 
ones.

RESULTS 
At this point, all the data presented in the previous 
sections is compiled. The telecommunication network´s 
technology 
and 
architecture 
were 
chosen; 
several 
components of a local scale optical fiber network were 
identified, as well their cost in a 30 years period and the 
urban+suburban distribution was characterized  leading to 
two types of urban settlements: the concentrated and the 
disperse with several variants. 
This section resumes the conclusions after applying the 
described techno-economic method to the geographical 
model and respective scenarios. 
A. Architecture tips: profitable distance to share ODPs 
The deployment of the optical network in all seven 
urban scenarios, Table VII, followed the same method. 
First, all the ODP were placed as close as possible to the 
buildings, in order to capitalize its cost in a relation with 1 
ODP per 20 DU´s. The ODP´s have an output of 24 fibers, 
but it was assumed that 4 fibers were reserved to operator´s 
maintenance operations. If the scenario is not a building but 
several individual houses the same ODP is shared among 
them as long they are in the same side of the street. 
At this point it is interesting to understand how long L1 
can be, before the need of a second ODP considering the 
balance of the investment in fiber and in another ODP. The 
depicted variables R1 and R2 try to illustrate this theoretical 
situation. On the left of the image, it is shown the ideal 
situation of 1 ODP per building, in the middle there is the 
case of an ODP sharing using underground fiber and in the 
right there is the situation of an ODP sharing with aerial 
fiber, see Figure 3.  
 
Figure 3. Testing scenarios for techno-analysis of ODP sharing: the 
ideal situation of 1 ODP per building (on the left), the ODP sharing 
with fiber underground (in the middle), ODP sharing with aerial fiber 
(on the right). 
In a concentrated environment and according to the 
pattern adopted, 1 FP serves 12 cabinets and each one serves 
32 ODP and the cost evaluation of the Local Scale Cost per 
ODP (LSCO) can be calculated as presented in (4).

Within this perspective a first finding is that R1=49m 
and R2=176m is the maximum recommended L1, see 
Figure 1 before use another ODP. After the distribution of 
the ODP´s, it is necessary to place the cabinets with the 
splitters optimizing the L2 (it also depends on licenses and 
municipally authorization). And depending on it, the 
location for the flexibility points should be placed 
optimizing L3 length. 
B. GPON Cost comparison per geographic model 
Taking these rules into attention and deploy the chosen 
GPON architecture per geographic scenario it is possible to 
apply the developed calculation algorithm based on 
MSExcell to each one of the urban concentrated and 
dispersed settlements. A shopping list can be extracted from 
the calculation tool and can be seen in more detail in 
TABLE VIII.  
As expected, the investment in infrastructure is always 
bigger in dispersed than in concentrated enviroment but 
massive saving can be done either by sharing or choose 
aerial deployment. This last solution is less expensive from 
58% to 78% than the buried one, for 50% of ducts shared 
and can reach more than 85% in dispersed uniform and 
occasional settlements if there is a 100% sharing.

CONCLUSIONS 
The deployment of broadband networks is one of the 
target measures of several governments and entities in many 
countries around the world. In some geographic areas, it can 
be interpreted as an answer to the market demand for new

and attractive high speed applications; in other areas it is 
seen as a seed of development. One relevant fact is that this 
dichotomy is shared among many countries, ranging from 
the most industrialized to the emerging economies, meaning 
that in most of the countries both situations can be found. In 
fact, there is a widespread understanding that the access to 
broadband is a factor of society’s equitable opportunities. 
However, the cost is still a drawback and investments 
should be done wisely. 
This paper presented the quantification of a PON 
network using an approach that combines fiber optics 
engineering and deployment with geographic tools. This 
analysis was focused at the local neighborhood level, taking 
into consideration urban and exurban scenarios modeled by 
the geographical method.  
This analysis is part of a project made with several 
departments, to identify the costs of all type of infra-
structures as a function of the degree of urban dispersion 
(telecommunications, 
gas, 
water, 
sewage, 
garbage 
collection, electricity and public lightning) based on the 
characterization of two Portuguese medium sized cities. The 
main objective of the global project is to attribute a cost 
value per DU in a modern city and surroundings as a 
guideline to future concerted territorial planning policy.
