Abstract—A sensor incorporating nanostructured zinc oxide 
film on planar and thermally isolated MEMS platform is 
reported for detecting methanol vapours. An innovative 
technique for fabricating sensor having integrated microheater 
with improved mechanical strength is presented. The proposed 
innovation 
facilitates 
the 
sensor 
to 
achieve 
desired 
temperature on the chip at lower power. The sensors are 
capable of detecting methanol vapours at 50 °C and at room 
temperature (30 °C) with slightly reduced sensitivity. To 
achieve the operating temperature of 50 °C and 30 °C, the 
sensor requires only 40 and 20 mW of power respectively. The 
lower operating temperature has been achieved due to the use 
of nanostructured material as sensing layer. The sensor is 
capable of giving detectable response for concentrations of 
methanol vapor as low as 5 ppm.

 INTRODUCTION  
In many industries, gases and volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) are increasingly being used as raw 
materials and for this reason, it has become very important 
to develop highly sensitive detectors for these compounds. 
It is desirable that such devices should continuously 
monitor the VOCs and gases in the environment in 
quantitative and selective manner [1]. However, many of 
these devices have not yet reached commercial viability 
because of problems associated with the production 
worthiness of the gas sensing technologies. Selectivity, 
power consumption on account of heating requirements of 
the sensing layer and reliability are some of the issues 
which have not been adequately resolved for these sensors 
to be deployed on a large scale [2]. With the increasing 
demand for better gas sensors of higher sensitivity and 
greater selectivity, intense efforts are being made to find 
more suitable materials with the required surface and bulk 
properties for use in gas sensors. Detection and 
quantification of gaseous species in air as contaminants 
(polluting gases) at low cost is also becoming important. 
The metal oxides have been explored and used as 
sensing layers in gas / VOC sensors for more than a decade 
[3, 4-10]. ZnO is one of the prominent metal oxide 
materials, which has been extensively investigated for 
gas/VOC sensors. This arises because of the high mobility 
of conduction electrons and good chemical and thermal 
stability under the operating conditions. The use of nano-
structured materials for the sensing device is envisaged to 
further improve the sensitivity of these devices at lower 
operating temperature [1-2, 11]. This is attributed to 
enormously increased surface to volume ratio compared to 
their thin films.  
The sensors based on metal oxide materials operate at 
elevated temperatures (~ 300 °C) which results in higher 
power consumption [4, 8, 10]. To reduce the heat loss and 
thus power consumption, the thickness of the substrates is 
selectively reduced [12]. The thinning of the substrate 
results in reduced mechanical strength of the substrate. As a 
result, extra care is required during packaging. The yield 
also becomes an important issue.  
In the present work, the sensors are fabricated using 
two different techniques: (a) on suspended diaphragm of 
SiO2 (~2 μm) and (b) thermally isolated planar platform. 
The proposed innovation facilitates the sensor to achieve 
desired temperature on the chip at lower power. The sensing 
film in both the cases is nanostructured ZnO. The sensors 
are capable of detecting the methanol vapours in the range 
of 5-50 ppm at fairly low operating temperature of 50 °C. 
Furthermore, the power consumption is also considerably 
reduced without compromising the mechanical strength of 
the substrate in the planar type thermally isolated platform 
presented here. To the best of our knowledge, this type of 
performance is not reported in the published literature. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL WORK 
A schematic drawing of the sensor on suspended 
diaphragm is shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding process 
flowchart is shown in Fig. 2. The sensor was fabricated 
using 7-masks process sequence and used a combination of 
bulk-surface micromachining technique [13]. The starting 
silicon wafers were 280 μm thick, n-type, having 5–10 Ω-
cm resistivity and (100) orientation. A layer of SiO2 (1 μm) 
was grown by thermal oxidation process. A window was 
opened on front side of the wafer by lithography technique 
(mask #1) and a pit (2.5 mm x 2.5 mm and 5 μm depth) was 
formed using bulk micromachining which was carried out 
in 40% KOH solution at a temperature of 80 °C. ZnO was 
then deposited as sacrificial layer using RF magnetron 
sputtering technique and its thickness was chosen to be 
somewhat more than the pit depth [13, 14].

The pit was planarized using lithography process (mask 
#2) followed by chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). 
Silicon dioxide layer (1 μm) was then sputter deposited on 
the wafer in the next step. A layer of nickel (0.3 μm 
thickness) was then deposited using RF diode sputtering 
over this SiO2 layer. The Ni layer was then patterned using 
photolithography to form the microheater (mask #3). Over 
this, a layer of SiO2 (1 μm) was again sputter deposited. The 
purpose of this layer was to electrically isolate the heater 
and the aluminum inter-digital electrodes to be formed in 
the next step. The SiO2 from the microheater contacts was 
removed (mask #4). The aluminum layer of 0.8 μm was 
then deposited by thermal evaporation and patterned to 
form the sensing inter-digital electrodes (mask #5). A Zn 
film (0.3 μm) was selectively deposited using lift-off 
technique (mask #6) and annealed at 300 °C for 12 h in air 
ambient. The lift-off technique was used for patterning Zn 
as the etchant for Zn [HCl-DI water solution (1:100 by 
volume)] affects the Al.  As the last step, the sacrificial 
layer was etched to complete the fabrication. The sacrificial 
layer etching was accomplished through lateral etching 
initiated from four windows formed outside the sensor area 
using photolithography (mask #7), as illustrated in the Fig. 
2 and Fig. 5.

A window was opened on front side by lithography 
technique (mask #1) and a pit (5mm x 5mm and 5 μm 
depth) was formed using bulk micromachining which was 
carried out in 40% KOH solution at a temperature of 80 °C. 
The pit was filled by SiO2 deposited by RF magnetron 
sputtering 
process. 
The 
pit 
was 
planarized 
using 
photolithography (mask #2) and CMP. The rest of the 
process steps are identical to those used in the previous 
design. The advantage of fabricating sensor using the above 
mentioned process is that the complete sensor is fabricated 
on silicon substrate using trench formation, backfill and 
CMP. Thus there is no diaphragm or hanging structure. The 
mechanical strength of the substrate is retained in this 
approach. The optical photographs of the sensors fabricated 
on suspended diaphragm (2 μm) and on thermally isolated 
platform are shown in Fig. 5.

III  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 6 shows the plot of power consumption versus 
temperature for the sensors fabricated on suspended 
diaphragm (2 μm) and sensor fabricated using thermally 
isolated platform.

suspended diaphragm (2 μm) and sensor fabricated using thermally 
isolated platform technology. 
 
It can be concluded that the electrical power required to 
raise the temperature of the sensing layer to required level is 
considerably reduced because of improved thermal isolation 
of the sensor fabricated on suspended diaphragm. For 
example, a temperature of 175 °C is reached at a power of 
80 mW for a sensor prepared on suspended diaphragm and 
same temperature is achieved at a power of 90 mW for 
sensor fabricated using thermally isolated platform 
technology. In contrast, the power consumption for the 
same operating temperature of the sensor made on 
conventional silicon substrate has been simulated and 
measured to be about 235 mW. The advantage of using 
thermally isolated planar platform technology is that the 
mechanical strength of the substrate is not compromised 
while the power consumption is also very low. 
The SEM image of nanostructured ZnO film is shown in 
Fig.7. The VOC sensing results of the sensors fabricated on 
thermally isolated platform are now presented. The sensor 
was tested for methanol vapors in a closed chamber [15]. 
The sensor was heated to different temperatures by applying 
power to the integrated heater. The methanol vapors were 
introduced in the chamber by bubbling N2 through the 
methanol maintained at room temperature (20 °C). The 
desired concentration of the vapors was obtained in the 
chamber by controlling the flow rate of N2 through 
methanol and adding pure air through a separate gas line 
[15]. 
(b) 
(a) 
The flow rates were measured and controlled using 
precision flow meters. The concentration of methanol 
vapors was calculated using the following equation [16].

The focus of the present work is to develop energy 
efficient sensors that can operate near room temperature. 
This is an important consideration for the sensors to be 
deployed at remote places and are battery operated. The 
power 
consumption 
becomes 
an 
important 
issue. 
Accordingly, one of the primary aims of the present work is 
to develop the sensor, which can give appreciable response 
at lower operating temperatures. This will result in lower 
power consumption of integrated microheater thereby 
prolonging the life of the battery. It was observed that at 50 
°C, the power consumption of the microheater was 
significantly less as compared to the corresponding value at 
150 °C. Also, the sensor response at 50 °C is appreciable. A 
comparison of the sensor response at 30, 50, 100 and 150 
°C is presented in Fig. 8 to illustrate this point. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 8. Response of the sensor to 50 ppm of methanol vapors at different 
operating temperatures. 
 
The response of the sensor at 50 °C for other VOCs is 
shown in Fig. 9. It can be clearly observed that the sensor 
shows detectable change in resistance at such a low 
operating temperature. It was observed that at 50 °C, the 
change in sensor resistance is significant for methanol 
vapors as compared to other VOCs. This shows that at 
operating temperature of 50 °C, the sensor is somewhat 
selective to methanol. The power required to achieve 
temperature of 50 °C is only about 40 mW.  
The dynamic response of the sensor to different 
concentrations of methanol vapors at 50 °C operating 
temperature is shown in Fig. 10. The sensor is capable of 
detecting methanol vapors down to 5 ppm level. The sensor 
showed repeatable response with response time of 80 s and 
recovery time of about 120 s. The large values of response 
and recovery times are attributed to the large size of the 
chamber used for testing and does not represent the inherent 
response time of the sensor [15].

From these studies, it can be inferred that, if at a given 
time, several VOCs are present, then the sensor developed 
in the present work cannot distinguish these individually. 
However, one can use this sensor in application such as 
electronic nose where there is an array of sensitive sensors 
and the response can be given to artificial neural network 
for training and testing purpose. Identifying a particular 
VOC in presence of several other VOCs continues to be a 
challenge.

IV. CONCLUSION 
The aim of the present work was to develop energy 
efficient sensors, which are capable of operating at 
considerably reduced temperatures. For this purpose, 
nanostructured ZnO was synthesized using a catalyst-free 
process and the same was integrated with MEMS 
processing. To reduce the power consumption of the 
microheater integrated with the sensor, an innovative 
technique for fabricating the sensors on a planar and 
thermally isolated MEMS platform is presented.  It has been 
demonstrated that the fabricated sensors are energy-
efficient. The sensor is prepared using low cost materials 
and is capable of detecting methanol vapors at 50 °C 
utilizing only 40 mW of power. The sensor showed quite a 
large change in its resistance on exposure to methanol at 50 
°C. The concept of a thermally isolated oxide platform is 
implemented using technologies which are standard 
processes in integrated circuit and MEMS manufacturing. 
The mechanical strength of the silicon substrate is not 
compromised in the present technology, as is the case when 
similar levels of power reduction is achieved by creating a 
cavity by partial etching of silicon from the back side or 
making a sensor on a suspended diaphragm. The standard 
packaging techniques can be used for the innovative sensors 
developed in the present work as the silicon wafer has no 
cavities in it. The proposed process does not require any 
modification in mask design, wnen the substrate thickness 
changes because of wafers of different diameter. Double-
side polished wafer is also not needed in the present work. 
The issues of compatibility of sensing layer material with 
etchants used for the formation of sensing electrode of 
aluminum are completely resolved by using lift-off process 
for patterning the Zn film.
