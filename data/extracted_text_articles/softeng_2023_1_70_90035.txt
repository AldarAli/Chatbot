Abstract—The typical approach to data analysis is to store, 
query, and analyze data in a central location. In the case of 
source code, where multiple organizations or partners in a 
consortium contribute to a software, the repositories would be 
distributed and might be private. Within such a setting, one 
goal would be achieving and maintaining a certain level of 
source code quality across the consortium. One solution is to 
consider each partner as a node in a federated network. This 
paper proposes a federated code quality query and analysis 
platform. It further presents the features and the design of this 
platform. 
Keywords-source code quality; federated network; federated 
query; federated analysis. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
There are cases where each partner in a consortium, such 
as in the NESSI-SOFT project [1] in the Sixth Framework 
Programme and in the MODUS project [2] in the Seventh 
Framework Programme, does not want to share all of its 
source code but needs to be queried whether holding a pre-
determined minimum source code quality level so that a 
certain level across the consortium is achieved and 
maintained. For such cases, one solution is to build a 
federated network so that each node in this network has its 
privacy, but shares required quality information. This paper 
considers this setting for source code quality and proposes a 
Federated Source Code Quality Query and Analysis 
(FSCQQA) platform. The setting is visualized in Figure 1. 
The FSCQQA platform consists of a central site as seen 
at the top of Figure 1 and multiple sites, which are peers. It is 
a kind of peer-to-peer network, where the peers accept and 
follow a general policy and corresponding rules. In addition, 
the central site is responsible for inclusion and removal of 
peer sites with respect to the general policy. Such platforms 
are on the rise especially in the health field, where privacy 
regulations and expectations are high, and accountability is 
enforced at state level. The proposed FSCQQA platform is 
one of the early attempts, where the idea is applied to source 
code, but not health records. Therefore, we believe that there 
is a practical gain from such a platform proposal.

The proposed platform is not only for consortiums to 
utilize. A global software company with development sites in 
various countries can also benefit from the FSCQQA 
platform. In this setting, concerns like revealing too much 
information about the software under development and the 
software development team may be relieved.  
The FSCQQA platform offers opportunities for querying 
and monitoring source code quality across a consortium. 
This platform can facilitate analyzing how source code 
improvements are performed and how defect numbers are 
minimized. The FSCQQA platform has the following 
features: 
• 
Analyze software quality with defect and source 
code metrics. 
• 
Share defect and source code metrics with peers and 
consortium administration/management. 
• 
Follow trends and improve. 
• 
Compile federated historical data on defects and 
source code quality. 
The features are kept at minimum in the paper, but they 
can be extended easily. To serve these features, the 
FSCQQA platform provides a data infrastructure, a software 
stack, and the operations on them. The proposed design is 
novel. The FSCQQA platform can be used for source code 
quality and defect prediction in the future. 
As of today, there are multi-site software development 
companies whose sites are globally distributed. Each site is 
autonomous to some degree, but they are subject to central 
management rules. In such a setting, tracking each site’s 
software quality and achieving an overall performance is not 
easy. Such a platform would be beneficial to them as well. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the 
bug, or defect, datasets and source code quality metrics. 
Section III explains the proposed platform. Section IV 
outlines related work, and the last section concludes the 
paper. 
II. 
FUNDAMENTALS 
A. Bug Datasets 
Lately, bug datasets are composed for bug or defect 
prediction. Following this, Ferenc et al. [3] compiled and 
standardized existing public bug datasets. The same group 
[4] extended their bug dataset and made the dataset publicly 
available at [5]. Several research works have produced and 
utilized bug datasets to develop and evaluate novel bug 
prediction methods. The objective of their study is to collect 
and combine current public source code metrics-based bug 
databases. In addition, they evaluated the abundance of 
gathered metrics and the bug prediction skills of the unified 
bug dataset. One research direction in this field moves 
toward combining bug datasets with software code quality 
metrics for better prediction. One of the first attempts is 
published by Osman et al. [6]. They evaluated sixty distinct 
bug prediction setting combinations on five open-source Java 
projects using a cost-aware evaluation scheme. Change 
measurements combined with source code metrics were 
discovered to be the most cost-effective option for 
developing a bug predictor. Another example of this work is 
presented by Mashhadi et al. [7]. They conducted a 
quantitative and qualitative study on two prominent datasets 
(Defects4J and Bugs.jar) utilizing 10 common source code 
metrics, as well as two popular static analysis tools 
(SpotBugs and Infer), for the purpose of evaluating their 
capacity to anticipate flaws and their severity.  
B. Source Code Quality Metrics 
Software quality metrics have been proposed for decades. 
The literature starts in 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, design 
metrics and their impact on software and source code were 
mainly studied. Henry and Selig [8] published a book on 
design metrics, which predicts source code quality. Two 
early research works specifically on source code quality 
metrics are by Pearse and Oman [9] and by Welker et  al. 
[10]. They worked on the maintainability of source code. 
With the popularity of object-orientation, the research in 
this area was intensified. Nuñez-Varela et al. [11] did a 
comprehensive mapping investigation on 226 articles that 
were published between 2010 and 2015 and discovered 
nearly 300 source code metrics. Even though object-oriented 
metrics have received a great deal of attention, there is a 
need for greater research on aspect and feature-oriented 
measurements. Prediction of software faults, complexity, and 
quality 
evaluation were 
recurring 
themes 
in 
these 
investigations. 
Currently, there are separate tools as well as tools 
embedded into platforms, which not only produce source 
code quality metrics but also calculate technical debt. The 
next step for these tools seems to be towards predictions and 
suggestions for better code quality. Our vision and current 
attempt are in the same direction. 
III. 
PROPOSED PLATFORM 
We propose a federated code quality query and analysis 
platform, called FSCQQA. In this section, we first explain 
our design goals, such as “authentication and authorization” 
and “logging and monitoring” and continue with the services 
the FSCQQA platform provides. Some local services may 
vary between sites, but standardized procedures and rules 
will be implemented to ensure uniform administration and 
oversight. Finally, we present our user interface design to 
give a sense of use cases for the FSCQQA platform. 
A. Design Goals 
The major design goals are as follows: 
Authentication & Authorization (AA): Each partner or site 
may have its own AA mechanism implemented. Then, each 
partner is responsible for the FSCQQA platform for its users’ 
queries. Each query includes the user and site identification; 
the site is responsible for logging the queries. 
Access Control (AC) Policies: Each site may have its 
policies and regulations depending on the country where the 
site is. Therefore, the response to each query is filtered 
locally before sending. Each site should guarantee that any 
response does not contain any personal identifiable 
information. 
Secure Communication: Each site must be able to 
communicate securely with trustworthy peers. All nodes 
42

SOFTENG 2023 : The Ninth International Conference on Advances and Trends in Software Engineering

exchange secure Public Key Infrastructure certificates in 
order to establish trust. While the FSCQQA platform is a 
federated network, the security of the nodes is only as strong 
as the network's weakest link. 
Logging and Monitoring: Every query executed by a 
node should be recorded in an audit trail that the peer sites 
could view. The logs will be monitored by the central site for 
anomalies. 
Standard APIs: Each site should provide standard APIs 
defined by the FSCQQA platform. Although the FSCQQA 
platform provides a software agent called FSCQQA agent to 
fulfil this requirement, the site may choose to implement its 
own software agent. 
Source Code Repositories: The FSCQQA platform 
provides a software agent to work with GitHub [12] 
repositories. However, this is not a must. Any site can work 
with any source code repository but must ensure that 
standard APIs required by the platform are provided. 
Management of Federated Platform: There is a central 
site responsible for the management of partners and their 
sites. These management operations include adding and 
removing partners and sites (a partner may have more than 
one site), constantly informing partners about other alive 
partners and sites, and collecting velocity and trend 
information from site. 
B. Services 
The FSCQQA platform defines two types of services, 
one provided by the FSCQQA agent and the other by the 
standard 
FSCQQA 
APIs. 
The 
FSCQQA 
agent 
is 
customizable through configurations with the following 
parameters: 
• 
GitHub repository address 
• 
GitHub repository access rights 
The FSCQQA agent automatically generates local defect 
database for each site from a GitHub repository by extracting 
commit/issue histories and analyzing them. At the same 
time, it collects software metrics, such as lines of code and 
cyclomatic complexity, for each commit/issue. The defect 
information with software metrics will represent source code 
quality of the software developed at a site. Moreover, the 
FSCQQA agent extracts source code related metrics for a 
specific version using tools, such as OpenStaticAnalyzer 
[13]. The process is presented as an Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) sequence diagram in Figure 2. The 
FSCQQA agent is also responsible for the management of 
the local database for defects and metrics. To mitigate 
security concerns related to such an agent software, its 
source code should be open. 
The standard FSCQQA APIs provide the services of the 
FSCQQA platform with respect to Open-API specifications 
[14]. The services are grouped as follows: 
• 
Defect related metrics: number of existing (active) 
defects, defect density, defect resolve velocity, 
longest unresolved defect. 
• 
Source code related metrics: class metrics, method 
metrics, 
coupling 
metrics, 
cohesion 
metrics, 
cyclomatic complexity metrics. 
The services provide data for a specific version. They can 
be extended to supply data between two versions, but it may 
complicate the presentation of information and is, therefore, 
left as future work. The service calls can be for a specific 
metric or a set of metrics from a specific site or the whole 
network. If the whole network is queried, the query site 
requests all alive sites from the central site and queries each 
one individually then accumulates the results. 
 
 
Figure 2.  The FSCQQA platform overview. 
The central site keeps a list of alive sites in the federated 
network by recording their heartbeats. Each site is expected 
to send a heartbeat every hour. If a site’s heartbeat is missing 
necessary notifications are performed. The central site also 
holds summarized metrics for the whole network, such as 
overall defect resolve velocity and its trend over some time.  
C. User Interface Design 
The user interface design is presented via Figures 3-5. A 
user either in a site or in the central site can see the 
repositories with proper access rights, as shown in Figure 3. 
To mimic this operation, Figure 1 presents some public 
GitHub repositories. This project repository and selection 
window also indicates the status of the project with four 
states: “Not Analyzed”, “Analyzing”, “Analyzed”, and 
“Failed”. After selecting a project, a window like the one in 
Figure 4 is shown and if the status is neither “Analyzing” nor 
“Analyzed”, the "Analyze" button appears. If it has already 
been analyzed, the details of the analyze operation are 
shown. To see the metrics, the metrics button should be 
pressed, and it takes the user to a window like the one shown 
in Figure 5. It is called the dashboard and presents various 
metrics with charts and graphs. Metrics, charts, and graphs 
are all customizable.

RELATED WORK 
The concept of federated networks is not new, and they 
are not limited to a certain field. The services are called 
federated if their service architecture spans numerous 
independent control domains [15]. It is challenging to 
manage federated services and provide effective customer

assistance since only a tiny portion of the environment can 
be monitored and controlled by any given authority. Bhoj et 
al. [15] characterized many facets of federated networks as 
early as 1997. Some other examples of federated networks 
are as follows. For instance, Afsarmanesh et al. [16] 
proposed 
the 
PRODNET 
architecture 
for 
federated 
information management. Another example is Open Cirrus 
[17], which is proposed to federate a multitude of sites with 
diverse hardware, services, and tools for providing federated 
data centers for open source systems and services research. 
The sites reside on different continents and are subject to 
different privacy legislation and concerns.

The health domain is currently running federated 
networks. For instance, CanDIG [18] is a Canadian national 
health federated research data platform designed to assist the 
finding, querying, and analysis of permitted health research 
data across institutions and projects. CanDIG is the first 
Canadian federation of many human genomes and 
biomedical data projects. Another proposal for health 
domain is the Cross-Institutional Clinical Translational 
Research project [19], which investigated a federated query 
tool and examined how this tool can facilitate the discovery 
of clinical trial cohorts by controlling access to aggregate 
patient data housed in academic medical centers that are not 
linked. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Each day, new features are added to software, and with 
each new feature, extra bugs may be introduced, and source 
quality may suffer. The scenario becomes more complicated 
if the software development is distributed with specific 
privacy and trade secret considerations. When addressing the 
challenges mentioned above, it is desired that the software 
quality be maintained above a particular threshold. Toward 
this goal, this paper proposes a federated source code quality 
query and analysis platform called FSCQQA. 
With the proposed platform, sites are not required to 
disclose their codes with any other site while aiming for high 
source code quality and low defect ratio. At each site, local 
defect datasets will be generated and analyzed. The analysis 
results as defect metrics and the source code metrics 
obtained from the static analysis will be shared within the 
federated network and can be queried. Furthermore, trend 
analysis can be conducted at the central site and shared with 
consortium sites. 
As future work, federated analytics and prediction using 
the local datasets are planned. The sites may push defect-
related features to the central site for future machine 
learning. Such a defect database is valuable in terms of 
following the reliability of each site but also in improving 
defect-free development by providing in-depth analysis, such 
as root-cause analysis, and suggesting training and 
education. Then, the prediction model will generate 
predictions on sites. The prediction model will be updated 
and enhanced based on further coming data, meaning new 
source code. As developer data will not be exchanged, there 
will be no privacy concerns.
