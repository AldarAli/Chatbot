Abstract—The Linked Data Web (LDW) is an evolution of
the traditional Web from a global information space of linked
documents to one where both documents and data are linked.
A signiﬁcant amount of geographic information about places are
currently being published on this LDW. These are used to qualify
the location of other types of datasets. This paper examines
the limitations in the nature of location representation in some
typical examples of these Resource Description Framework (RDF)
resources, primarily resulting from the simpliﬁed geometric
representation of location and the incomplete and random use
of spatial relationships to link place information. The paper
proposes a qualitative model of place location that enforces an
ordered representation of relative spatial relationships between
places. The model facilitates the application of qualitative spatial
reasoning on places to extract a potentially large percentage
of implicit links between place resources, thus allowing place
information to be linked and to be explored more fully and more
consistently than what is currently possible. The paper describes
the model and presents experimental results demonstrating the
effectiveness of the model on realistic examples of geospatial RDF
resources.

INTRODUCTION
One of the ‘Linked Data Principles’[1] is to include links
to connect the data to allow the discovery of related things.
However, identifying links between data items remains a
considerable challenge that needs to be addressed [2]. A key
research task in this respect is identity resolution, i.e., to
recognise when two things denoted by two URIs are the
same and when they are not. Automatic linking can easily
create inadequate links, and manual linking is often too time
consuming [3]. Geo-referencing data on the LDW can address
this problem [4], whereby links can be inferred between data
items by tracing their spatial (and temporal) footprints. For
example, the BBC uses RDF place gazetteers as an anchor to
relate information on weather, travel and local news [5].
Yet, for geospatial linked data to serve its purpose, links
within and amongst the geographic RDF resources need them-
selves to be resolved. That is to allow place resources to be
uniquely identiﬁed and thus a place description in one dataset
can be matched to another describing the same place in a
different dataset. A scheme that allows such links between
place resources to be discovered would be a valuable step
towards the realisation of the LDW as a whole.
In this paper, location is used as a key identiﬁer for place
resources and the question to be addressed is how location
can be used to deﬁne a linked place model that is sufﬁcient to
enable place resources to be uniquely identiﬁed on the LDW.
Several challenges need to be addressed, namely, 1) location
representation of RDF place resources is simple; deﬁned as
point coordinates in some resources, detailed; deﬁned with
extended geometries in others, and sometimes missing all
together, 2) coordinates of locations may not match exactly
across data sources, where volunteered data mapped by in-
dividuals is mashed up with authoritative map datasets, 3)
non-standardised vocabularies for expressing relative location
is used in most datasets, e.g., in DBpedia, properties such
as dbp:location, dbp-ont:region and dbp-ont:principalarea are
used to indicate that the subject place lies inside the object
place.
Towards addressing this problem, a linked place model is
proposed that uses qualitative spatial relationships to describe
unique place location proﬁles. The proﬁles don’t rely on
the provision of exact geometries and hence can be used
homogeneously with different types of place resources. They
can be expressed as RDF statements and can thus be integrated
directly with the resource descriptions. The rationale behind
the choice of links to be modelled is primarily twofold: to
allow for a sensible unique description of place location and
to support qualitative spatial reasoning over place resources.
The value of the linked place model is illustrated by measuring
its ability to make the underlying RDF graph of geographic
place resources browsable. Samples of realistic geographic
linked datasets are used in the experiments presented and
results demonstrate signiﬁcant potential value of the methods
proposed.
The paper is structured as follows. An overview of related
work on the representation and manipulation of place resources
on the LDW is given in section II, In section III the proposed
relative location model is presented and in section IV, its
application on two different realistic datasets is evaluated.
Conclusions and an overview of future work is given in section

RELATED WORK
Here related work on the topics of representing place
resources and reasoning with them on the LDW are reviewed.
A. Representing RDF place Resources on the LDW
Sources of geographic data on the LDW are either vol-
unteered (crowdsourced) resources, henceforth denoted Vol-
unteered Geographic Information (VGI), created by indi-
viduals with only informal procedures for validating the
content, or authoritative resources produced by mapping

organizations, henceforth denoted Authoritative Geographic
Information (AGI). Example of VGIs are DBpedia (db-
pedia.org), GeoNames (geonames.org), and OpenSreetMaps
(linkedgeodata.org)[6] and examples of AGIs are the Ordnance
Survey linked data [7] and the Spanish linked data [8].
The volume of VGI resources is increasing steadily, provid-
ing a wealth of information on geographic places and creating
detailed maps of the world. DBpedia contains hundreds of
thousands of place entities, whose locations are represented
as point geometry. GeoNames is a gazetteer that collects
both spatial and thematic information for various place names
around the world. In both datasets, place location is repre-
sented by a single point coordinates. While DBpedia does
not enforce any constraints on the deﬁnition of place location
(e.g., coordinates may be missing in place resources), reference
to some relative spatial relationships, and in particular to
represent containment within a geographic region, is normally
maintained. GeoNames places are also interlinked with each
other by deﬁning associated parent places.
In [9], the LinkedGeoData effort is described where OSM
data is transformed into RDF and made available on the
Web. OSM data is represented with a relatively simple data
model that captures the underlying geometry of the features.
It comprises three basic types, nodes (representing points on
Earth and have longitude and latitude values), ways (ordered
sequences of nodes that form a polyline or a polygon) and
relations (groupings of multiple nodes and/or ways). Further-
more, [10] presented methods to determine links between
map features in OSM and equivalent instances documented
in DBpedia, as well as between OSM and Geonames. Their
matching is based on a combination of the Jaro-Winkler string
distance between the text of the respective place names and
the geographic distance between the entities. Example of other
work on linking geodata on the Semantic Web is [11], which
employs the Hausdorff distance to establish similarity between
spatially extensive linear or polygonal features.
In contrast to VGI resources that manages geographic
resource as points (represented by a coordinate of latitude and
longitude), AGI resources deal with more complex geometries
as well, such as line strings. AGIs tend to utilise well-
deﬁned standards and ontologies for representing geographic
features and geometries. Ordnance Survey linked data also
demonstrates the use of qualitative spatial relations to describe
spatial relationships in its datasets. Two ontologies, the Ge-
ometry Ontology and the Spatial Relations Ontology, are used
to provide geospatial vocabulary. These ontologies describe
abstract geometries and topological relations (equivalent to
RCC8 [12]) respectively.
In summary, the spatial representation of place resources in
VGI datasets is generally limited to point representation, and
is managed within simple ontologies that encode non-spatial
semantics and in some cases limited spatial relationships. On
the other hand, place data provided as AGI tend to present
more structured and detailed spatial representations, but is also
limited to speciﬁc types and scales of representation. Use of
some qualitative spatial relationships has been demonstrated
for capturing the spatial structure in some example datasets.
The model proposed in this paper offers a systematic and
homogenous representation of place location that can be con-
sistently applied to VGIs or AGIs and demonstrates the value
of heterogenous qualitative spatial relations in representing
place information on the LDW.
B. Manipulating and Querying RDF place resources on the
LDW
Recently, much work has been done on extending RDF
for representing geospatial information through deﬁning and
utilising appropriate vocabularies encoded in ontologies to
represent space and time. The work capitalises on speciﬁcation
of standards, deﬁned by the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC)(opengeospatial.org), for modeling core concepts related
to geospatial data. Prominent examples are GeoSPARQL, an
OGC standard [13] and stRDF/stSPARQL [14]. Both proposals
provide vocabulary (classes, properties, and functions) that can
be used in RDF graphs and SPARQL queries to represent
and query geospatial data, for example geo:SpatialObject,
which has as instances everything that can have a spatial
representation and geo:Geometry as the superclass of all
geometry classes. In addition, geometric functions and topo-
logical functions are offered for performing computations,
such as geof:distance and for asserting topological relations
between spatial objects, e.g., dbpedia:Cardiff geo:sfWithin
dbpedia:Wales.
Qualitative spatial representation and reasoning (QSRR)
are established areas of research [15], whose results have
inﬂuenced the deﬁnition of models of spatial relationships in
international standards, e.g., the OGC models, and commercial
spatial database systems (for example, in the Oracle DB
system). RCC8, a QSRR model, has been recently adopted
by GeoSPARQL [13], and there is an ever increasing interest
in coupling QSR techniques with Linked Geospatial Data
that are constantly being made available [14]. On the other
hand, Semantic Web reasoning engines have been extended
to support qualitative spatial relations, e.g., Racerpro [16]
and PelletSpatial [17]. Scalability of the spatial reasoning is
recognised and reported challenge. Scalable implementations
of constraint network algorithms for qualitative and quantita-
tive spatial constraints are needed, as RDF stores supporting
Linked Geospatial Data are expected to scale to billions of
triples [14]. Lately, promising results have been reported by
[18], who proposed an approach for removing redundancy in
RCC8 networks and by [19], who examined graph-partitioning
techniques as a method for coping with large networks; in
both cases leading to more effective application of spatial rea-
soning mechanisms. Finally, qualitative methods were used to
complement existing quantitative methods for representing the
geometry of spatial locations. In [20], heterogenous reasoning
methods are proposed that combine calls between a spatial
database system and a spatial reasoning engine implemented
in OWL2 RL to check the consistency of place ontologies.
In [21], Younis et al described query plans that make use
of a combination of qualitative spatial relationships associated
with place resources in DBpedia and detailed representations
of geometry maintained in a spatially indexed database for
answering complex queries. In both cases, qualitative reason-
ing was limited by the fragmented and scarce availability
of spatial relationships to work on. The qualitative scheme
of representation of place location proposed in this paper
addresses this issue and provides a novel method for deﬁning
spatial relationships that is designed to support and facilitate
the effective use of qualitative spatial reasoning on the LDW.

A LINKED PLACE MODEL FOR THE LINKED DATA
WEB
A Relative Location model (RelLoc) is proposed here to
capture a qualitative representation of the spatial structure
of place location. Two types of spatial relations are used as
follows.
1)
Containment relationships, to record that a parent
place directly contains a child place; i.e., one step
hierarchy. For example, for three places representing
a district, a city and a country, the model will explic-
itly record the relationships: inside(district, city) and
inside(city, country), but not inside(district, country).
2)
Direction-proximity relationships, to record for every
place the relative direction location of its nearest
neighbour places. The direction frame of reference
can be selected as appropriate. For example, for a
4-cardinal direction frame of reference, a place will
record its relative direction relation with its nearest
neighbour in four directions.
For a given set of places Pl, let DirPr be the set of all
direction-proximity relations between instances of places in Pl
as deﬁned above, and let Con be the set of containment rela-
tions between instances of places in Pl as deﬁned above. Then,
RelLoc(Pl) is deﬁned as a tuple RelLoc(Pl) := (Pl, D, C),
where: D ∈ DirPr and C ∈ Con. Rnn(x, y) is used to denote
that x is the nearest neighbour from the direction R to object
y. For example, Nnn(pl1, pl2) indicates that pl1 is the nearest
neighbour from the north direction to pl2, etc.
To illustrate the model, consider the scene in Figure 1 that
consists of a set of places, a to f, with a 4-cardinal direction
frame of reference overlaid for some places in the scenes.
A representative point is used to deﬁne the place location.
It is further known that places represented as points a, b, c, e
are inside d and places d, f are inside g. The full set of
relationships used to model the scene are given in the table
in Figure 1(b). Note that in some cases, no relation can be
found, e.g., there are no neighbours for object c from the west
direction in Figure 1(a).
A. Spatial Reasoning with the Relative Location Model
We can reason over the relative location model to in-
fer more of the implicit spatial structure of place location.
Qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) tools can be utilised
to propagate the deﬁned relationships and derive new ones
between places in the scene. QSR takes advantage of the
transitive nature of the partial or total ordering of the quan-
tity space in order to infer new information from the raw
information presented. In particular, the transitive nature of
some spatial relationships can be used to directly infer spatial
hierarchies, for example, containment and cardinal direction
relations. The scope of the model is deliberately focussed
on general containment relationships and ignores other pos-
sible topological relations, such as overlap or touch. Hence,
building containment hierarchies is straightforward using the
transitivity rules: inside(a, b) ∧ inside(b, c) → inside(a, c)
and contains(a, b) ∧ contains(b, c) → contains(a, c).
In the case of direction relationships, more detailed spatial
reasoning can be applied using composition tables. Table I
shows the composition table for a 4-cardinal direction frame
of reference between point representations of spatial objects.

In considering the entries of the composition tables, some of
those entries provide deﬁnite conclusions of the composition
operation, i.e., the composition result is only one relationship
(emboldened in table), other entries are indeﬁnite and result
in a disjunctive set of possible relationships, e.g., the compo-
sition: N(a, b) ∧ E(b, c) → N(a, c) ∨ E(a, c).
Spatial reasoning can be applied on the linked place model
using different strategies. The most straightforward is through
deriving the algebraic closure, i.e., completing the scene by
deriving all possible missing relationships between objects.
Path-consistency algorithms for deriving the algebraic closure
has been been implemented in various tools, e.g., in the SparQ
spatial reasoning engine [22]. Table II shows the result of
this operation for the example scene in Figure 1. Explicit
relations are shown in bold and the remaining relation are
inferred by spatial reasoning. As can be seen in the table,
using the 19 relationships deﬁned for the model in Figure 1(b),
reasoning was able to derive a further 19 deﬁnite relationships,
completing over 90% of the possible relations in the scene.

B. Applying the Relative Location Place Model on the LDW
The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a
collection of triples, each consisting of a subject, a predicate
and an object. A set of such triples is called an RDF graph, in
which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link and
each triple represents a statement of a relationship between the
subjects and objects, denoted by the nodes, that it links. The
meaning of an RDF graph is the conjunction (logical AND)
of the statements corresponding to all the triples it contains.
The RelLoc place model can be interpreted as a simple
connected graph with nodes representing place resources and
edges representing the spatial relationships between places.
Thus a realisation of the place model for a speciﬁc RDF
document of place resources is a subgraph of the RDF graph of
the document. The RelLoc RDF graph is completely deﬁned if
RDF statements are used to represent all spatial relationships
deﬁned in the model, e.g., for the scene in Figure 1, 25
RDF statements are needed to encode the cardinal (19) and
containment (6) relationships in the table in Figure 1(b).
Let Pl be a ﬁnite set of place class resources deﬁned in
an RDF data store and DirPr(Pl) deﬁnes cardinal direction
relations between members of Pl and Con(Pl) describes the
containment relations between members of Pl as deﬁned by
the relative location model above.
A RelLoc subgraph GL = (VL, EL) is a simple connected
graph that models Pl, where: VL = Pl is the set of nodes,
EL = {DirPr(Pl) ∪ Con(Pl)} is the set of edges labelled
with the corresponding direction and containment relation-
ships.
Note that there exists a subgraph of GL for every place
pl ∈ Pl, which represents the subset of direction-proximity
and containment relationships that completely deﬁne the rela-
tive location of pl. Thus, a location proﬁle for a particular place
pl ∈ Pl can be deﬁned as Lpl = {(DirPrpl, Conpl}. Lpl is
the restriction of L to pl, where DirPrpl and Conpl deﬁnes
direction proximity and containment relations respectively
between pl and other places in Pl, as speciﬁed by our model.
For example the location proﬁle for place a in Fig-
ure 1 is the set of statements describing the relations:
N(d, a), S(b, a), W(c, a), E(e, a), in(a, d).
The RelLoc graph can be represented by a matrix to register
the adjacency relationship between the place and its nearest
neighbours. The scene in Figure 1 is shown as a graph with
nodes and edges in Figure 2(a) and its corresponding adjacency
matrix is shown in (b). The fact that two places are neighbours
is represented by a value (1) in the matrix and by a value
(0) otherwise. Values of (1) in the matrix can be replaced by
the relative orientation relationship between the corresponding

APPLICATION AND EVALUATION
The main goals of the Linked Place model is to provide
a representation of place location on the LDW that allows
for place information to be linked effectively and consistently.
The effectiveness of the proposed model can be evaluated
with respect to two main aspects; whether it provides a sound
deﬁnition of place location, that is to test the correctness of
the place location proﬁles, and whether it provides a complete
deﬁnition of place location, that is whether a complete relative
location graph can be derived using the individual place
location proﬁles.
The soundness of the location proﬁles is assumed as it
essentially relies on the validity of the computation of the
spatial relationships. Issues related to the complexity of this
process are discussed in the next section.
Here, we evaluate the completeness aspect of the model.

represents a ﬁnite set of spatial relationships between a place
and its nearest neighbours and direct parent. Completeness of
the model can be deﬁned as the degree to which these individ-
ual proﬁles can be used to derive implicit links between places
not deﬁned by the model. The model is entirely complete if a
full set of links between places can be derived using automatic
spatial reasoning, i.e., the model can produce a complete graph,
where there is a deﬁned spatial relationship between every
place in the dataset and every other place.
A system was developed that implements the Linked Place
model and further builds an enriched model using spatial
reasoning for evaluation purposes as shown in Figure 3.
Two datasets were used in this experiment, DBPedia and the
Ordnance Survey open data [7]. These were chosen as they
exhibit different representations of place resources on the LDW
and are typical of VGIs and AGIs respectively. A description
of the datasets used is presented below, along with the results
of the application of spatial reasoning over the constructed
linked place models.
DBpedia DataSet
A sample dataset containing all Places in Wales, UK, has
been downloaded from DBpedia using the sparQL query in
Figure 4.
A total of 489 places were used, for which a relative
location graph of 2751 direction-proximity relations was con-
structed. Completing the graph resulted in 116403 total number
of relations, out of which 50340 relations are deﬁnite (deﬁning
only one possible relationship).
Note that of the indeﬁnite relationships some are a dis-
junction of 2 relations, e.g., {N, NW} or {E, SE} and
some are a disjunction of 3 relations, e.g., {N, NE, NW} or
{NE, E, SE}. In both cases, relations can be generalised to
a “coarser” direction relation, for example, {NE, E, SE} can
be generalised to general East relationship. These results are
considered useful and thus are ﬁltered out in the presentation.

The remaining results are disjunctions of unrelated directions,
e.g., {N, NE, E}, and are thus considered to be ambiguous. A
summary of the results is shown in table III. Using the Linked
Place model we are able to describe nearly half the possible
relations precisely (45.6%), as well as almost all of the rest
of the scene (54.22%) with some useful generalised direction
relations.
Ordnance Survey DataSet
The Boundary-line RDF dataset for Wales was downloaded
from the Ordnance Survey open data web site [7]. The data
gives a range of local government administrative and electoral
boundaries.
Figure 5 shows the relative location graph constructed for
the Unitary Authority dataset for Wales. Dashed edges are
used to indicate that relationships (and inverses) are deﬁned
both ways between the respective nodes, but only one relation
is used to label the edge in the Linked Place model. The set
contains 22 regions, for which 73 direction-proximity relations
were computed. Reasoning applied on this set of relations
produces the results shown in Table IV.
We can use the above results to describe the effectiveness

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Data on geographic places are considered to be very useful
on the LDW. Individuals and organisations are volunteering
data to build global base maps enriched with different types
of traditional and non-traditional semantics reﬂecting people’s
views of geographic space and place. In addition, geographic
references to place can be used to link different types of
datasets, thus enhancing the utility of these datasets on the
LDW. This work explores the challenges introduced when
representing place data using the simple model of RDF, with
different geometries to represent location and different non-
standardised vocabularies to represent spatial relationships
between locations.
A linked place model is proposed that injects certain types
of spatial semantics into the RDF graph underlying the place
data. Speciﬁc types of spatial relationships between place
nodes are added to the graph to allow the creation of individual
place location proﬁles that fully describe the relative spatial
location of a place. It is further shown how the enriched relative
location graph can allow spatial reasoning to be applied to
derive implicit spatial links to produce even more richer place
descriptions.
The results obtained from the initial evaluation experiments
demonstrate possible signiﬁcant value in the proposed model.
Further work need to be done to explore the potential utility
of the proposal. Some of the interesting issues that we aim to
explore in the future are described below.
•
Simple methods and assumptions were used to com-
pute the direction relationships between places. Fur-
ther study need to be carried out to evaluate whether
more involved representations are useful.
•
No distinction between the types of place nodes are
made when creating the graph. Can place semantics
be utilised to guide this process further?
•
Applications of spatial reasoning need to be consid-
ered further. Describing the complete graph is not a
practical (nor a useful) option. Can spatial reasoning
be selectively applied, for example, as part of query
processing on the location graph.
•
Further evaluation is required to understand the scal-
ability of the proposals to much larger RDF triple
stores.
