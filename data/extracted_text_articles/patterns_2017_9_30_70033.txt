Abstract — Business processes in the domain of service procure-
ment have the potential to increase efficiency and reduce cost. 
These business processes are getting more complex since service 
providers and service consumers collaborate and interact in net-
work structures. A precise description, modeling, analysis and 
execution of service procurement business processes for the im-
plementation of process-oriented information systems is re-
quired to unlock these potentials and optimize network collabo-
ration. In this article, we propose a pattern based approach for 
business process models to improve this collaboration systemat-
ically. The approach is based on patterns of service phases and 
service modules to increase efficiency and reduce cost. 
Keywords – service e-procurement; business process design 
pattern; service phase patterns; service module patterns 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The service sector is a fast-growing sector in all industrial 
nations and therefore, it has gained significant importance in 
all national economies [1]. Today, the strategic impact of ser-
vices overruns products. With shifting the focus towards ser-
vices and moving to a more service centric perception away 
from a product centric view, a new paradigm service dominant 
logic is postulated [2]. New business models are arising with 
cross-company network structures where service providers 
and service consumers act in service networks, so called ser-
vice chains [3]. More and more companies outsource different 
areas and reduce the degree of company-internal value-add. 
More services are sourced externally and the meaning of ser-
vice procurement is increasing exponentially. Service pro-
curement becomes decisive for success and competition. A 
business process, which defines the control flows of service 
procurement, is called service process, a process object, which 
represents data flow is called service object. Within the net-
work structures of service chains, the complexity of service 
processes is raising. New requirements of service-oriented 
procurement result from the definition of services because of 
the specific characteristics like immateriality and integrality, 
which determine the specific characteristics of transactions 
between service providers and service consumers. The use of 
modern information technologies like service-oriented archi-
tecture (SOA) for the electronic service processes of service 
procurement sounds quite promising. The efficiency and per-
formance of service processes can be improved and cost can 
be reduced. Due to the increasing competition and cost pres-
sure in the domain of service procurement, service processes 
leverage the improvement potential and come to the fore of 
companies. A systematic and structured approach for model-
ing and analyzing service processes based on patterns leads to 
a harmonization and integration of service processes and ad-
vantage transparency and structure. We develop two new pat-
terns, namely, service phase patterns and service module pat-
terns. Their application is presented based on examples and 
their advantages are outlined. The remainder of this article is 
structured as follows: in Section 2, we look at the current chal-
lenges of service procurement and motivate our approach. We 
look into design patterns and introduce Petri nets as a formal 
modeling language in Section 3. Service procurement design 
patterns are proposed in Section 4. In Section 5 and Section 6, 
we introduce two different design pattern types for service 
processes and motivate the advantages. Finally, Section 7 of 
this article concludes with findings and outlook on future 
work. 
II. CHALLENGES AND MOTIVATION 
Today's service procurement processes of small and me-
dium-sized companies are often characterized by heterogene-
ous and product-oriented business processes [3]. In contrast to 
products, services require interaction that is more personal and 
are more difficult to describe and to measure. Therefore, the 
procurement of services turns out to be more complex (1) due 
to process descriptions, (2) due to data descriptions and (3) 
due to process iterations, (4) due to unknown result of a ser-
vice after a service request and (5) due to the individuality of 
services. A high amount of manual process tasks and there-
fore, missing automation can be observed [5]. Cross-company 
process structures are heterogeneous and the process and data 
flow design are influencing each other: an information asym-
metry results out of different proprietary data formats and in-
consistent data. The electronic procurement of services has 
still not reached a high level of maturity [6]. In summary, the 
following challenges can be observed: 
 complex collaborative internal and cross-company busi-
ness process models lead to high opacity, iterations and 
adjustment cost 
 heterogeneous business processes, long process flows and 
use of different media lead to non-seamless processes

 heterogeneous data structures, different data formats and 
descriptions lead to non-integration and non-harmoniza-
tion of data 
 heterogeneous information technology (IT) landscapes 
with different interfaces lead to missing integration 
 low maturity level of service process automation leads to 
long throughput times, redundancy of tasks and source of 
errors 
Existing business process modeling methods for model-
ing, analysis and implementation of service processes aren`t 
matured enough and only cover partially the domain specific 
needs for service e-procurement. New methods for the harmo-
nization, integration and standardization are needed: 
 best practice based definition for understanding business 
processes and data 
 harmonization and integration of business processes 
 harmonization and integration of data 
 integration of information systems 
These challenges can be addressed by new domain-ori-
ented design patterns. In this paper, we present a new domain-
oriented design pattern approach based on the formal model-
ing language Petri nets. The Petri net based design patterns 
build up best practice knowledge and incorporate an inte-
grated modeling approach for process and data structures. De-
sign patterns provide an immediate benefit (1) by reducing de-
sign and integration efforts, (2) by encouraging best practices, 
(3) by assisting in analysis, (4) by exposing inefficiencies, (5) 
by removing redundancies, (6) by consolidating interfaces and 
(7) by encouraging modularity and transparent substitution 
[7]. 
III. BUSINESS PROCESSS DESIGN PATTERN 
A pattern is a discernible regularity and the elements of a 
pattern repeat in a predictable manner. Patterns are an abstrac-
tion of a concrete problem observation, which was recognized 
due to its frequent appearance in a certain domain [8]. Hence, 
patterns result from experiences and behavioral observation. 
They represent identical modes of thought, design fashions, 
behaviors or courses of action, which can be repeated and re-
produced. Software design patterns are introduced in the do-
main of software engineering. They are general solutions to 
solve a problem in a given context. Thus, a design pattern pro-
vides a reusable blueprint that may speed up the development 
of software [9] and is considered as a solution template for 
high quality software [10]. Software design patterns always 
represent solutions to common design problems in a given 
context [11]. Design patterns at architectural level provide so-
lution templates at component level (e.g., as the pipes and fil-
ters pattern does). Object-oriented design patterns, on the 
other hand, typically show relationships and interactions be-
tween classes or objects, they are distinguished into creational 
patterns, structural patterns, behavioral patterns and concur-
rency patterns. 
Design patterns can create substantial improvements of 
software quality and reduce costs associated to development 
and maintenance. Nowadays, design patterns are widely used 
since they capture and promote best practices in software de-
sign. Many catalogues for design patterns are known today, 
like patterns for software engineering from Gamma et al. [12] 
and patterns for the enterprise integration scenarios of soft-
ware applications from Hohpe and Woolf [13].  
Similarly, business process design patterns describe best 
practices for process models in a certain domain. These pat-
terns are also based on empirical knowledge about process ac-
tivity execution. Thus, business process design patterns are 
formalizing common structures of activities of process and 
data flows [14]. While a concrete pattern is bound to a specific 
modelling language, its abstraction is language independent 
and can be transferred to other business process modeling lan-
guages as well [12]. Specific patterns for the Petri net model-
ling language are outlined in the next subsection. 
Barros et al. [15] define service bilateral and multilateral 
interaction patterns, which allow emerging web services func-
tionalities like choreography and orchestration. Additionally, 
domain-oriented design patterns offer a flexible mechanism 
with clear boundaries in terms of well-defined and highly en-
capsulated parts being aligned with constraints of the consid-
ered domain [16].  
A. Petri net based process pattern 
Petri nets are a formal modeling language to model, ana-
lyze, simulate and execute distributed, discrete systems. Petri 
nets are bipartite graphs. Also, Petri nets can be used to model 
different levels of detail. Petri nets offer the modeling of static 
and dynamic elements, limited capacities of places and anon-
ymous tokens to capture process objects. Petri nets are graph-
ically represented by tokens (process objects), places (condi-
tions), transitions (process tasks) and directed arcs (arrows). 
Places are containers for tokens and describe pre- or post-con-
ditions for transitions. Places represent local conditions and 
describe static process components. Transitions describe dy-
namic process components and represent local state transi-
tions [17]. As a formal and platform-independent modeling 
approach, high-level Petri nets allow for modeling with a pre-
cise description of individualized tokens. Hence, this can be 
used for the formalization of domain-specific process objects 
[18]. As a well-established modeling language, Petri nets have 
also been proposed to model process and data structures as 
mechanism for analysis and software-based execution of busi-
ness processes. Especially, high-level Petri nets may be used 
as input for transformation to executable business processes. 
Van der Aalst and ter Hofstede [19] define fundamental 
Workflow patterns based on Petri nets to formalize require-
ments of workflow languages and information systems. These 
patterns are further distinguished into exception handling pat-
terns, control flow patterns, data flow patterns and resource 
patterns. Further existing examples for Petri net process pat-
terns are given by TimeNET [20] (a software tool to model, 
analyze and control manufacturing systems based on colored 
Petri nets), EXSPECT [21] (a repository of tool for standard-
ized business processes in logistics and production) or 
CIMOSA [22] (the modeling and analysis of cross-company 
value chains). To formally model supply chains as business 
processes, Liu et al. [23] are using Petri nets to define basic 
patterns of supply chains. Schuster [8] proposes resource as-
signment patterns and defines high-level resource nets.

IV. SERVICE PROCUREMENT DESIGN PATTERN 
In the domain of service procurement, service suppliers 
and service consumers collaborate with each other. The col-
laboration itself can be considered as an instance of a service 
procurement process model. An instance of a service process 
model is described as a choreography of specific service 
phases, which comprise internal and cross-company service 
processes and service modules. The order of exchanged mes-
sages is predefined. Choreography is used to define a cross-
company service process out of several independently orches-
trated service processes (see Fig. 1). The interaction between 
several partners for the procurement of services based on the 
exchanged data is described [24]. The order of the exchanged 
data is pre-defined. Only valid orders of data between partners 
are allowed to be defined. 
 
Figure 1.  Choreography of service phases and orchestration of service 
modules on different abstraction levels 
Based on our review of scientific literature [25] and em-
pirical case studies [26], we derive new patterns for service e-
procurement, which represent best practice of service procure-
ment processes. We introduce the design patterns Service 
Phase Patterns (SPP) and Service Module Patterns (SMP) 
also supporting software architectures based on service-ori-
ented architecture. These patterns define hierarchic structures 
and provide a structured concept for the modeling and imple-
mentation of service procurement process models. SPP and 
SMP ensure and precisely describe the order of message ex-
change and interaction in bilateral and multilateral service 
chains and constitute required process interfaces.  
A sequence of SPP includes data flow, complex service 
processes and web services. SPP consist of SMP and are 
linked by internal and cross-company process interfaces. The 
choreography of SPP serves as a connector between orches-
trations of SMP and their internal service processes. A con-
crete sequence of SMP is pre-defined. The combination of 
SPP and SMP results into global, cross-company service pro-
cesses, which define the interaction of internal service pro-
cesses accordantly.  
The pattern-based application using SPP and SMP leads to 
a top-down approach from specific process phases down to 
detailed service process descriptions, executed by web ser-
vices. The pattern-based approach enables a coordinated real-
ization of service processes in information systems at the ex-
ecution level. In a first modeling and description approach of 
service e-procurement process descriptions, we use Petri nets 
as modeling language to describe domain-specific service 
phases and service modules. Based on this definition, we fur-
ther develop these patterns based on XML nets [27], a high-
level Petri net variant. 
V. DESIGN PATTERNS FOR CHOREOGRAPHY OF PROCESS FLOW 
AND DATA FLOW 
Service procurement processes (between service providers 
and service consumers) are characterized by highly collabora-
tive service processes. The collaboration is defined by specific 
process and data flows based on specific process interfaces. It 
can be observed that typical recurrent service procurement 
process models are characterized by a specific order of data 
flow and by specific service procurement types. These recur-
rent orders of process and data flow defining service procure-
ment types can be described by patterns. 
A. Service Phase Patterns (SPP) 
SPP choreograph service procurement phases and there-
fore, the data flow in order to represent and manage cross-
company interaction. The logic of process flow instances is 
determined as well. SPP are characterized by capsulated ser-
vice procurement processes on a higher abstraction level. SPP 
configure different service procurement types. A service pro-
curement type pre-defines a service process model, which rep-
resents a specific process flow occurrence for service procure-
ment. The following service procurement types are defined: 
 A planned need of a service is required and a frame con-
tract does not exist. 
 A non-planned need of service is required and a frame con-
tract doesn’t exist 
 A planned need of a service is required and a frame con-
tract exists. 
 A non-planned need of service is required and a frame con-
tract exists. 
Based on a specific service procurement type, SPP can be 
configured to choreograph the data flow and process flow (see 
Fig. 2).

Petri net 
B. Definition and modeling of SPP with Petri nets 
SPP are transition-bounded service processes and are rep-
resented in a Petri net as a single transition, which can be ex-
tended to sub nets. Service places are defined by a set of ser-
vice object-specific places, which are classified into service 
object places SO, static and dynamic service interface places 
SI and service document places SD (see Fig. 3).  
 
 
Figure 3.  Service object specified places SO, SD and SI 
SPP represent a self-contained set of cross-company col-
laborative service processes. SPP are connected by cross com-
pany interfaces defined by service object-specific interface 
places SI and SD. SPP are represented graphically by a rectan-
gle, which includes the service phase name (see Fig. 4). 
 
Figure 4.  SPP modeled as Petri net 
Domain-specific concepts for a formal modeling approach 
of service processes in the context of service e-procurement 
are also formalized based on high-level Petri nets. The transfer 
of the presented formalized concepts further enables commu-
nication and information context. SPP are further developed 
into formalized patterns based on high-level Petri nets with 
individualized and distinguishable tokens representing the 
service e-procurement-specific data transfer in information 
systems. Specific interfaces in collaborative and cross-com-
pany service processes represented by service process phases 
are identified, formalized and defined as patterns based on 
high-level Petri nets. The set of service object-specific places 
SPS are typified as object containers for service processes and 
defined as an XML net. SPS represent the complex data flow 
based on XML service objects to define the data and docu-
ment exchange in collaborative cross-company service pro-
cesses.  
The set of typified service object specific places SPS is 
further distinguished into the set of service object places SSO, 
service interface places SSI and service document places SSD. 
The domain specific stereo types of SPP are proposed. SPP 
based on XML nets represent coarsened structures of capsu-
lated service processes and SMP. SPP are defined based on 
specific, typified input and output places. They represent pro-
cess patterns. SPP are defined based on the process and data 
flow of collaborative service e-procurement processes and 
consider the specific phases. Fig. 5 shows the example of the 
pattern of the service phase Accounting AC. 
SPP are formally defined as the set TSP based on single 
transitions with dedicated service object-specific places. The 
sets of input places 𝑆𝑆𝑂
𝐼𝑁 and output places 𝑆𝑆𝑂
𝑂𝑈𝑇 are assigned 
and consist of the sets of service object places SSO, service 
interface places SSI and service document places SSD. Each 
service phase 𝑡𝑠𝑝𝑗

 is defined by its internal structure, which 
enables the composition of service phases.

C. Advantages of SPP 
SPP for service processes of service procurement process 
models enable the following advantages: 
 SPP choreograph service procurement phases and data 
flow and therefore, they define recurring process flow and 
data flow orders based on best practice in service procure-
ment. 
 SPP are defined patterns for the service procurement 
phases specification, request, quotation, order, execution, 
measurement, acceptance and accounting. 
 SPP configure best practice service procurement types. 
 SPP enable a pre-defined data flow. The order of ex-
changed data is prescribed for the definition of domain-
specific standard for the interaction and data exchange for

partners [28]. The definition of specific data and process 
sequences provides the basis for required process inter-
faces in complex business-to-business (B2B) scenarios. 
VI. DESIGN PATTERNS FOR ORCHESTRATION OF PROCESS FLOW 
AND DATA FLOW 
Collaborative service processes describe the interaction of 
service suppliers and service consumers on a detailed business 
process level. The pre-defined order of recurring service 
phases can be further structured into detailed service modules. 
These patterns of detailed service modules describe a recur-
ring process and data flow characterized by specific process 
interfaces. 
A. Service Module Patterns (SMP) 
SMP are characterized by capsulated electronic service 
processes. SMP define orchestrations of their internal capsu-
lated service processes. The process and data flow is orches-
trated. The activities of these service processes are executed 
by web services for the horizontal and vertical integration of 
different information systems. One of the main characteristics 
of SMP is collaboration: the collaborative service process of a 
process participant is further capsulated into service modules.  
B. Definition and modeling of SMP 
Collaborative SMP are transition-bounded service pro-
cesses and are represented in a Petri net as a single transition, 
which can be extended to sub nets. SMP define  self-contained 
collaborative service processes of one collaboration partici-
pant (service supplier or service consumer). SMP are repre-
sented graphically by a rectangle, which includes the specific 
service phase name as well as the participant of the service 
process (see Fig. 6). The set of SI and SD are input and output 
places of service modules.  
 
Figure 6.  SMP modeled as Petri net 
SMP are defined based on high-level Petri nets. SMP rep-
resent coarsened collaborative service processes of one pro-
cess participant. The collaborative service process consists of 
several SMP representing all process participants and there-
fore, the entire service process of a SPP. SMP are connected 
via a set of input and output places SPS to model bidirectional 
interaction and communication patterns like sending and re-
ceiving. The internal structure of a service module is built by 
a coarsened service net and consists of a set of internal input 
and output places (𝑆𝑆𝑀
𝐼𝑁, 𝑆𝑆𝑀
𝑂𝑈𝑇) and internal transitions. The set 
of input and output places is defined as an internal module in-
terface of a service module. The internal structure of a service 
module fulfills the requirements of a workflow net and sound-
ness criteria [29]. A service module interface 𝑆𝑠𝑚1
𝐼𝑁/𝑂𝑈𝑇 of one 
service module 𝑡𝑠𝑚
1  can be melted with the service module in-
terface 𝑆𝑠𝑚2
𝐼𝑁/𝑂𝑈𝑇 of another service module 𝑡𝑠𝑚
2 . The set of ser-
vice modules TSM is defined as single transition of a transi-
tion-bounded sub XML net XN'=(S',T',F') as part of an XML 
net and dedicated to one service process phase of the set of 
service process phases TSP. The syntactical compatibility of 
service process modules enables the composition of service 
process modules. Syntactically compatible service process 
modules have completely overlapping process interfaces. The 
composition of service process modules causes the melting of 
the common set of interface places. Based on a specific SPP, 
a capsulated service process can be further detailed into SMP 
to orchestrate the data flow and process flow (see Fig. 7). 
 
Figure 7.  SMPs modeled as XML net 
C. Advantages of SMP 
SMP for service procurement processes enable the follow-
ing advantages: 
 SMP orchestrate the process flow and data flow and there-
fore, they define recurring collaborative service processes 
based on best practice in service procurement. 
 SMP define patterns for the detailed service procurement 
processes specification, request, quotation, order, execu-
tion, measurement, acceptance and accounting. 
 SMP enable a modularization concept for modeling and 
implementing collaborative service processes. The de-
fined activities can be further modeled and implemented 
by web services. 
VII. CONCLUSION & OUTLOOK 
We presented two new patterns SPP and SMP for the cho-
reography of service phases and the orchestration of service 
modules in collaborative cross-company business process 
models. The design patterns are intended to describe recurring 
service process sequences based on observed best practices. 
SPP and SMP support the modeling and implementation of 
electronic service processes. SPP and SMP are defined based 
on a formal Petri net modeling approach for service e-procure-
ment business process models.  
Both the formal modeling language of Petri nets, as well 
as the service procurement domain-specific patterns lead to 
improved domain understanding, and support simulation 
based analysis as well as process implementation. The defini-
tion of SPP and SMP enables 
 an integrated, formalized modeling approach of service 
processes and service objects. 
 the modeling of hierarchic service processes and modu-
larization of collaborative service processes. 
 the definition and modeling of service process interfaces.

 a step-wise transformation of modeling to different for-
malization levels. 
 the support of distributed business processes based on ser-
vice oriented architecture (SOA). 
 the validation of service process models. 
As next steps, we further need to verify that these patterns 
meet the set of design specification and its intended purpose. 
We will also have to conduct further experiments to ensure the 
usability, the level of details and completeness of the defined 
patterns. We will evaluate our pattern approach by analyzing 
further service e-procurement use cases in order to validate the 
correctness and use of purpose of the pattern approach. We are 
planning to integrate the new defined patterns into a modeling 
approach for service processes, so called Service nets. The 
presented patterns SPP and SMP will be a part of the defini-
tion of Service nets. This modeling approach will serve as 
modeling support for collaborative service processes and dis-
tributed hierarchic service process models. The integrated 
modeling of service processes and service objects, the formal-
ization of different levels of abstraction (hierarchy) and the 
modularization of service processes (interface design) will be 
addressed herein. The domain-specific extension of Petri nets 
is only based on a syntactical level without changing the se-
mantic characteristics of Petri nets. Our pattern approach is 
based and developed on use cases of service e-procurement of 
industrial services. E-procurement of other service domains 
will also be analyzed and validated. The pattern approach can 
be transferred to further service process types different than 
procurement. Analog service process types are repair orders, 
return orders, warranty service orders and further ones. The 
pattern-based modeling approach will also further be used for 
simulation experiences and benchmarking of collaborative 
service processes of different service supplier and service con-
sumer combinations.
