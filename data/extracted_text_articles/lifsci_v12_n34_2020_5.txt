Abstract-Latter-stage elderly people, as well as people with 
diseases such as hemiplegia, often have a walking disability, 
which increases their risk of falling and suffering injuries. The 
magnitude of the angular velocity during both the heel rise 
phase of walking (kicking the floor) and swing phase (swinging 
the toe forward) is lower for disabled people compared to 
healthy individuals, owing to their lower muscle power. We have 
developed a spring assist unit that fits in the heel of a shoe and 
helps disabled people raise their heel when beginning to walk. 
Experimental results demonstrate that it substantially assists in 
walking and normalizing gait. We also report a correlation 
between body weight and optimal spring stiffness, and that the 
spring assist unit does not affect the individual’s walking 
posture.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extension of the paper initially presented 
at the Twelfth International Conference on eHealth, 
Telemedicine, and Social Medicine [1]. In this paper, we 
discuss additional experiments that we conducted with 
elderly people to show the effectiveness of our proposed 
system. 
As the percentage of elderly people worldwide increases 
[2], so too will the number of functionally impaired people, 
such as those with hemiplegia. People with such diseases, as 
well as latter-stage elderly people often have walking 
disabilities that increase their risk of falling and consequently 
suffering injuries [3]. Tao et al. reviewed gait analysis using 
various wearable sensors [4]. They indicated that gait 
analysis using wearable sensors is useful for estimating fall 
risk, although they did not describe the gait of people with 
walking disabilities. 
Our study compared the walking gaits of hemiplegia 
patients and healthy students. We showed that the magnitude 
of the angular velocity during the phase in which the subject 
kicks the floor (heel rise phase) and swings the toe forward 
(swing phase) is lower for disabled people than for healthy 
counterparts. This is likely due to the lower muscle power of 
hemiplegia patients [5]. Thus, assisting the raising of the heel 
and swinging the toe forward while walking could help 
disabled people walk with a gait closer to that of younger and 
healthier individuals.  
The Solid-Ankle Cushion Heel (SACH) foot (1D10, 
Ottobock, Germany) [6]) and the Energy Storage And Return 
(ESAR) foot (Vari-Flex, Össur, Iceland)[7]) are provided for 
foot amputees to improve their gait. These prosthetics help 
the wearer raise their heel and lift their toes. Unfortunately, 
such devices cannot assist individuals with only walking 
disabilities. 
Mooney et al. reported result showing that the ankle 
exoskeletons 
does 
not 
exclusively 
reduce 
positive 
mechanical power at the ankle joint, but also mitigates 
positive power at the knee and hip as show in experiments 
with six participants without walking disabilities [8]. Leclair 
et al. developed an unpowered ankle exoskeleton using 
flexible air spring [9], although they did not conduct 
demonstration experiments for the people with disabilities. 
We also previously developed a prototype shoe in which a 
coil spring was built into the heel and a leaf spring was built 
into the back half of the sole. Experimental results 
demonstrated that our device reduced the magnitude of 
muscle power needed to raise the heel and swing the toes 
forward. We also demonstrated that there may be a 
correlation between body weight and optimal spring stiffness 
and that a spring assist unit would affect walking posture.  
We have thus developed a new shoe incorporating a 
spring assist unit built into the heel. Using springs with 3 kg 
to 11 kg of stiffness, our results demonstrate that there is 
surely a correlation between body weight and optimal spring 
stiffness and that the spring unit did not actually affect 
walking posture, unlike the previous prototype shoe. The 
main scientific contribution of this paper is that our newly

developed device reduced the magnitude of muscle power 
without negative effects. This contribution was shown 
through an experiment targeting elderly people. 
After introducing two kinds of foot prostheses, the SACH 
and ESAR feet in Section II, we describe in Section III the 
differences in gait between a hemiplegia patient and a healthy 
person in order to clarify the necessary characteristics to be 
addressed. A prototype shoe that incorporates a coil spring 
and a leaf spring is then described and evaluated as a walking 
assistance device in Section IV. The structure of the spring 
assist unit and the preliminary experimental results gathered 
from healthy young students are described in Section V. We 
then validate the effectiveness of our system using an 
experiment with elderly people in Section VI. Section VII 
concludes with a summary of the key points.  
II. WALKING ASSISTANCE MECHANISM WITH PASSIVE 
FOOT PROSTHESES 
Since there are no walking assistance devices for 
individuals with walking disabilities, such as latter-stage 
elderly people and hemiplegia patients, we instead cover 
walking assistance devices for foot prostheses in this section. 
There are two types of walking assistance mechanisms 
employed for passive foot prosthesis devices. 
The SACH foot [10], shown in Figure 1, was designed to 
provide shock absorption and ankle action characteristics 
close to those of a normal ankle without the use of an 
articulated ankle joint. The action of the SACH foot is 
achieved by the use of two functional elements: a properly 
shaped wedge of cushioning material built into the heel and 
an internal keel-shaped structural core at the ball of the foot 
to provide a rocker action. Its primitive form was developed 
toward the end of the 1800s. 
The ESAR foot, shown in Figure 2, has weak push-off 
power and an adequate rollover shape for the foot, which 
increases the energy dissipated during the step-to-step 
transition in gait. Wezenberg et al. reported that the ESAR 
foot was more effective than the SACH foot in reducing 
metabolic energy while walking [11], and Houdijk et al. 
reported that it improved step length symmetry [12].

III. DIFFERENCES IN GAIT BETWEEN HEMIPLEGIA 
PATIENTS AND HEALTHY PEOPLE 
We analyzed the walking gait cycles of healthy 
individuals and those with walking disabilities using a 
wearable device (WD) [3]. The individuals with walking 
disabilities had one-side paralysis and periodically received 
treatment at a rehabilitation facility. We measured the output 
data from an acceleration sensor and a gyroscope sensor in a 
WD mounted on the front of a shoe to estimate the kicking 
power and change of angle between the foot and the floor, as 
shown in Figure 3. For this measurement, we used a Sony 
SmartWatch 3 as a WD. 
We measured the angular velocity around the X-axis and 
the acceleration of Y-axis as shown in the Figure 3(b). The 
measured data were stored every 40 ms as JSON format in 
the memory of a smartphone. Figures 4 and 5 show examples 
of changes in acceleration, angular velocity, and angle for a 
healthy participant and one with a walking disability, 
respectively, over the course of two steps. Each flat period 
(roughly the center period) in these figures represents when 
the entire sole of the shoe touched the floor. Moving average 
lines of 120 ms are plotted in Figures 4 and 5. The maximum 
angular velocity at point A indicates the kicking power when

raising the heel, and the minimum angle at point B indicates 
the angle to the floor at terminal swing. 
The lowest angular velocity at point A of the unimpaired 
participant in Figure 4 was approximately 420° s−1, whereas 
the highest angular velocity at point A of the participant with 
a walking disability was only 250° s−1. Thus, the participant 
with a walking disability clearly had a weaker kicking power 
when raising their heel compared with that of the healthy 
individual, indicating a clear difference in gait. 
The highest angle at point B of the unimpaired person in 
Figure 4 was approximately −18°, whereas the lowest angle 
at point B of the participant with a walking disability in 
Figure 5 was approximately −8°. Thus, the swinging speed of 
the individual with a walking disability was also slower than 
that of the healthy participant. Similarly, the participant with 
a walking disability had difficulty raising their toe during the 
terminal swing phase. 
Tables I and II list the averages and standard deviations 
(SD) of the measured data for angular velocity at point A and 
angle at point B. The angular velocity at A is clearly different 
for unimpaired participants and those with walking 
disabilities. There is also a measurable difference between 
them in the angle at point B. However, the ranges of these 
values will sometimes overlap. 
IV. PROTOTYPE SHOE TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH WALKING 
DISABILITIES 
As described in Section III, individuals with a walking 
disability, such as those who suffer from hemiplegia, clearly 
have a weaker kicking power when raising their heel and 
swing power when swinging their toe forward. We first 
developed a shoe, shown in Figure 6, that assists individuals 
with walking disabilities. This shoe has a coil spring and a 
leaf spring that enables the wearer to raise their heel more 
easily. The spring force of the coil spring is 15 kg and the 
shoe has a roller to avoid the toe accidentally tripping. 
We compared the kicking powers (angular velocity) when 
the heel is raised between a normal shoe and our proposed 
assist shoe when worn by a stroke patient. The data are shown 
in Figure 7, wherein the vertical and horizontal axes show the 
kicking power and the number of steps taken by the 
individual, respectively. The kicking power with the assist 
shoe was lower and more stable than that with the normal 
shoe.  
For a test trial, we then conducted an experiment with a 
group of eight students who were asked to walk as if they had 
a disability while wearing a normal shoe and the assist shoe. 
The measured data are shown in Figure 8 with the kicking 
power measured by the sensor for each of the participants (i.e.,

eight healthy students and a disabled person). The blue and 
orange bars in Figure 8 show the average kicking power of 
participants wearing the normal and assist shoes, respectively. 
The highest point of the error bars represents the maximum 
kicking power for each individual. For every participant 
except one, the kicking power with the assist shoe was lower 
and more stable than that with the normal shoe. We also 
examined and observed that the shoe helped them to raise the 
foot slower using less power than the normal shoe and that 
this compensation power was stable. Measured data in 
Figures 7 and 8 confirm these observations. 
We also took integrated electromyogram (iEMG) 
measurements for two individuals with walking disabilities 
to confirm the effect of the assist shoe. We used the wireless 
EMG logger from the Logical Product Corporation [13]. The 
wireless EMG sensors were attached along the gastrocnemius 
muscle at the back of the calf and thigh of the right leg, as 
shown in Figure 9. Measured data, taken with a sampling rate 
of 500 Hz, is shown in Figure 10 wherein the vertical and 
horizontal axes denote the peak of the EMG signal measured 
by the iEMG sensor for each step and the number of steps, 
respectively. The iEMG readings for the assist shoe were 
lower than those for the normal shoe for both individuals. 
Thus, the compensation effect of the proposed assist shoe was 
also confirmed using iEMG.

It is clear that the proposed shoe compensates for muscle 
weakness. However, most evaluators, including the authors, 
felt that the timing to generate a spring reaction force was too 
early for them to walk smoothly; the timing at which the knee 
comes out in front of the ankle is best, and participants had to 
change their gait motion to effectively use the spring power. 
In addition, we noticed that there would be a correlation 
between body weight and the most effective spring power, 
which would affect the walking posture. 
The prototype shoe also features a toe roller. However, it 
is difficult to have individuals with walking disabilities 
intentionally trip over an obstacle, so we could not 
quantitatively evaluate this feature.

V. SPRING ASSIST UNIT TO HELP DISABLED PEOPLE WALK 
As described in Section IV, many participants felt that the 
timing for generating the spring reaction force was too early 
for them to walk smoothly. Thus, to address this, we proposed 
new shoes.  
A. Structure 
We focused on clarifying the correlation between body 
weight and optimal spring stiffness, the effect on walking 
posture, and developing the spring assist unit shown in Figure 
11. The mechanism for this unit is very simple as it comprises 
only a conical coil spring and a V-shaped attachment cover 
made of thin stainless steel. We adopt the conical spring from 
the power of 3, 5, 9, or 11 Kg. The spring is selected so that 
it is buried in the sole of the shoe when they step. 
B. Preliminary evaluation of assistance effects 
The prototype assist shoe shown in Figure 6 has a coil 
spring and a leaf spring and was made for the right foot. In 
contrast, the spring assist unit shown in Figure 11 was built 
into the heel part of the left and right shoes, as shown in 
Figure 12. To measure the degree of assistance given by these 
mechanisms and to evaluate the safety of these mechanisms, 
we ten students without walking disabilities to wear shoes 
with different spring stiffnesses and walk straight for 6 m 
while we measured the iEMG as a preliminary experiment 
before using participants with walking disabilities. For safety, 
we used people without walking disabilities  as participants 
first. We also measured the motions of the head and mid-hip 
to analyze the effects on walking posture. Wireless EMG 
sensors were attached to the gastrocnemius of the right leg, 
as shown in Figure 9, to gather iEMG data. The participant’s 
posture was measured using an MS-Kinect [14]. 
Examples of the measured iEMG vs. spring stiffness for 
two participants (A and B weighing 57 and 70 kg, 
respectively) are shown in Figure 13. The iEMG values were 
lower for each spring stiffness compared to the case without 
the spring assist unit. The value for Participant A was lowest 
at 5 kg and that for B was lowest at 9 kg. The spring stiffness 
resulting in the lowest iEMG signal was used to determine a 
relationship with the participant’s body weight. The spring 
stiffness at the lowest iEMG vs. participant body weight is 
shown in Figure 14. For example, the lowest iEMG of 
participant A was at 3 kg of spring power; this is represented 
as a point at 57 kg of body weight and 3kg of spring power 
in Figure 14. Visualizing this data allowed us to reveal a linier 
correlation between participant body weight and the 
magnitude of spring stiffness at the lowest iEMG reading.

The measured positions of the head and mid-hip for 
Participant C are shown in Figure 15 for walking without a 
spring assist unit and in Figure 16 for walking with the most 
effective spring assist unit. For both Figures 15 and 16, the 
vertical and horizontal axes denote displacement and elapsed 
time, respectively. We expressed “amplitude” as the position

measured by the Kinect in these figures because the data were 
measured as swinging by the steps. Blue and orange points 
denote the amplitude of the head and mid-hip, respectively. 
Changes in the up and down motion (UD) are shown in 
Figures 15(a) and 16(a) whereas changes in the left and right 
(LR) motion are shown in Figures 15(b) and 16(b). Without 
a spring assist unit, the UD motion of the head and mid-hip 
clearly mimics a sine wave, as shown in Figure 15(a). The 
LR motion of the head and mid-hip also changes, but 
apparently not like a wave as in Figure 15(b); and the period 
for this cycle does not differ from that of the UD motion. 
Thus, there are no significant differences between 
participants walking with or without a spring assist unit. 
From these figures, we also confirmed the safety of the 
mechanism in people without walking disabilities. 
The average range of each step’s peak during both LR and 
UD motions for participants A through E, who tried springs 
of 0 kg to 11 kg, is shown in Table III. Although there are 
differences between participants and spring stiffnesses, they 
seem to be random with no obvious patterns. 
A participant who tested the assist shoe shown in Figure 
6 and the pair of assist shoes shown in Figure 12 commented 
that “I had to step on the shoe to walk smoothly in the shoe 
shown in Figure 6, whereas I did not feel any effect of the 
spring units when walking with the shoes shown in Figure 12. 
I could walk smoothly without any additional actions.” We 
thus concluded that the spring assist unit does not affect 
walking posture.  
 
VI. EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM BY ELDERLY PEOPLE 
To examine the performance of the assistance device in a 
more practical environment, we enrolled elderly people for 
the evaluation because many lack sufficient power to raise 
their leg, a similar condition to disabled people.

were involved in the experiments. Three participants, 
Participant 5, 6, and 7, were female and the others were male. 
Figure 17 shows the experimental setting wherein 
participants walked straight for 5 m along the white line. 
Posture and EMG were measured using a Kinect and iEMG 
on the left leg, as shown in Figure 9. Figure 18 shows an

an 
experiment. 
Participants attached the iEMG to their feet as shown in 
Figure 18. Each participant walked with our proposed device 
with and without springs of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 kg power, as 
shown in Figure 11. 
B. Experimental results 
Figure 19 shows the iEMG values vs. the spring power 
for each participant. The vertical and horizontal axes show 
the voltage of the iEMG and the spring power used by each 
participant, respectively. Result shown in Figure 19 (e), (f) 
and (g) were obtained from the female participants. We 
observed similar trends as for the experiment involving 
healthy students (Figure 13). Many participants said that they 
could walk more easily using the springs. Participant 5 said 
that it was hard to walk because the shoe did not fit; however, 
the effectiveness of the spring was still evident. Lower iEMG 
values were obtained with and without the spring assistance

devices for both the 80-year-old and 76-year-old participants 
(Figures 19(c) and (d), respectively).  
Figure 20 shows the spring power at the lowest iEMG 
value vs. body weight for each participant. As for the younger 
participants (Figure 14), there was a linear correlation 
between the participant’s body weight and the spring power 
at which the lowest iEMG signal was obtained. 
Figures 21 to 25 present the measured positions of the 
head and mid-hip for Participants 1 to 5, respectively. Each 
figure shows the posture during walking (a) without a spring 
assist unit and (b) with the most effective spring assist unit 
(i.e., 7 kg, 7 kg, 7 kg, 5 kg, 3 kg, 3 kg, and 5 kg for Figures 
21 to 27, respectively). We confirmed that not only the UD 
motion, but also the LR motion of the head and mid-hip 
changes periodically and that two cycles of UD motion are 
likely to occur during each period of LR motion. We 
considered that UD motion occurred with each step whereas 
LR motion occurred with each right or left step. This trend is 
different in the younger participants shown in Figures 15 and 
16 and is likely due to aging. An especially large LR motion 
was observed in Participant 3 and the period of Participant 5 
was smaller because of the step length. However, there were 
no significant differences between participants walking 
without a spring assist unit and those with one, similar to 
Figures 15 and 16.  
The average peak-to-peak range for each step during the 
LR and UD motions of each participant with varying spring 
stiffnesses of 0–11 kg is shown in Table IV. Although there 
are differences between participants and spring stiffnesses, 
these are again random with no obvious patterns, similar to 
Table III.  
From, this experiment, we could not confirm the 
difference in the results between gender. Chumanov et al. 
showed that females walked with greater peak hip internal 
rotation and adduction than males, as well as gluteus 
maximus activity [15]. However we could not confirmed this 
trend from Table IV. Ko et al., [16] show that women walked 
with higher cadence and shorter stride length than men and 
had less hip range of motion, greater ankle in the sagittal 
plane, and greater hip in the frontal plane. We could not 
confirm the gender-based difference from Table IV.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
It is difficult for individuals with walking disabilities to 
raise their heels because of their lower muscle power. 
Therefore, most shuffle their feet when walking and 
sometimes stumble or trip over something and fall down. The 
shoes that we developed with the spring assist unit enable 
people with walking disabilities to raise their heels more 
easily and walk more smoothly. The electromyogram (EMG) 
was measured to analyze the efficacy of our assistance device. 
The EMG values for devices incorporating various spring 
stiffnesses were all lower than for those walking without the 
spring assist unit. There was a linear relationship between the 
spring stiffness at which the lowest EMG signal was observed 
and the participant’s body weight. These results demonstrate 
the assistive effect of the spring assist unit and that there is a 
linear correlation between body weight and the optimal 
spring stiffness of such devices. The spring in the shoes 
should be provided depending on user’s weight. 
We also measured the positions of the head and mid-hip 
with and without the spring assist unit for spring stiffnesses 
of 3 to 11 kg. Although there were differences between the 
participants and between the optimal spring powers, 
including devices with no spring, the differences were 
random without any obvious trends. The results also 
demonstrate that the spring assist unit did not affect walking 
posture. These trends were true for not only healthy young 
students, but also elderly people. Therefore, spring shoes 
afford wearers the chance to walk comfortably without 
affecting the posture in both people without walking 
disability and elderly people. Spring shoes are also expected 
to be applicable for people with disabilities when the strength 
of spring is adopted to the weight of users. 
Our future work will include the launch of a commercial 
version of this spring assistance device.
