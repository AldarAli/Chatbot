Abstract—Analysing, measuring, recognising and exploiting
emotion is an attractive agenda in designing computer games.
The current devices for imputing physiological modalities are
usually awkward to wear or handle. Here we propose a
Shark-ﬁn Mouse which streams three signals in real-time:
pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA, also known as galvanic
skin response or GSR) and skin temperature. All sensors
are embedded into a fully functional computer mouse and
positioned so as to ensure maximum robustness of the signals.
No restriction of the mouse operation is imposed apart from
the user having to place the tip of their middle ﬁnger into the
Shark-ﬁn hub. Boundary tests and experiments with a simple
bespoke computer game demonstrate that the Shark-ﬁn Mouse
is capable of streaming clean and useful signals.

I. INTRODUCTION
The video game industry, formally known as the interac-
tive entertainment industry, has enjoyed perpetual growth
since its foundation [8]. Video games are now experi-
encing the same level of ﬁnancial-investment as seen in
the ﬁlm industry. The video game industry is among the
largest entertainment industry worldwide, taking an esti-
mated global income exceeding $50 billion in 2011 [15]. As
computer systems have developed more processing power,
video games have become more realistic and accompanied
by the ever growing use of complex interactive devices,
ranging from vibrating controllers [22] to fully tactile haptic
feedback [23].
However, video games require more than representational
graphics and tactility to be engagingly realistic. Video
game environments also require greater humanlike emotive
attributes or interactions between players and video game
characters. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) attempts to bring the
individuality of emotive human characteristics to human
computer interactions (HCI). It has long been asserted that
emotions are an important part of the human psyche and
play a vital role in human communications [6]. The ﬁeld
Affective Computing (AC) has seen a dramatic rise in pop-
ularity over the past decade [24] [4] [25] permeating various
disciplines such as computer science, electronic engineering
and psychology. Growing on this trend, Affective Gaming
(AG) is receiving signiﬁcant consideration from academic
and industrial ﬁelds [20] [3] [2] [12]. However, there is still
no consensus on the best modalities and methods to use to
collect emotional data. Many modes have been considered
for use in gaming environments, see table I.

Emotions can be detected using a myriad of sensors.
These sensors can be broadly divided into two distinct
groups: behavioural and physiological, see ﬁgure 1. Be-

cently 3D depth sensors (Microsoft Kinect). Behavioural-
based emotion recognition systems are generally unobtru-
sive; however, various facets of emotion are not always
accurately displayed externally, particularly noted across
different cultures [17]. Physiological patterns of emotion
are less susceptible to cognitive artefacts; therefore give
a truer representation of experienced emotion state [13].
Physiological recognition systems use various electrodes or
sensors to detect changes in the body’s peripheral nervous
system [13]. However, physiological systems require sensors
that are in direct contact with the user’s skin or are attached
to the user. This raises the questions of wearablity and
comfort [3], particularly when introducing such a system
or device to a gaming environment. Principally, video game
input-devices are expected to add to the player’s experience
and not detract from the player’s enjoyment [2].
For an affective interaction device to be adopted, it should
be unobtrusive. The device should not hinder the player’s
enjoyment and should not handicap the player or the type
of game that can be played. It should be intuitive to use. A
player should not have to guess what the device should do.
In addition, the set-up procedure, if any, should be short and
straightforward. The player may get irritated by a delayed
start of the game or by having to strap a device to their
wrist, ﬁnger, chest of head.
One particular problem is the need to keep the physi-
ological sensors still when in use, due to the high levels
of ampliﬁcation often needed to pick up signals from the
body. Chanel et al [5] chose Tetris as a game that requires
only one hand to play, so that the signals can be measured
from the resting hand. Similarly, McQuiggan et al [16] relied
on a static hand while the subject played Treasure Hunt,
a bespoke HalfLife2-Source-engine driven game. However,
having one hand tied in sensors and having to keep it still
throughout the game may spoil the experience.
Many systems use sensors placed away from their re-
spective ampliﬁers and analogue to digital converters; thus
the signals are then carried through long (12”+) wires to
be processed. Therefore, artefacts introduced due to cables-
noise are ampliﬁed. To overcome this limitation, it would
be advantageous to integrate the sensors and the ampliﬁers
within a device already being utilised to control the game.
Special care has to be taken when designing such a device,
to ensure that the movements of the hand controlling the
device are not affecting the sensor outputs.
During the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Mike
Ambinder [2] highlighted the difﬁculty of obtaining a re-
liable pulse signal when actively playing a computer game.
Obtaining a robust heart rate signal by using a photoplethys-
mograph (PPG) is challenging as it is highly sensitive to

movement artefacts. For this reason, to apply a PPG to
a game controller, a mechanism is required to hold the
sensor/ﬁnger still during use.
Research carried out by Bonarini et al [3] on a novel de-
vice attached to the player’s head revealed several additional
problems. Participants reported that the device stimulated
excessive sweat, took too long to attach and was not very
intuitive to use.
Taking all into account, we believe that there is a niche
for a simple and unobtrusive device which can deliver some
of the most important physiological modalities for emotion
recognition in real time. This paper proposes such a device
in the form of a computer mouse. Our device attempts to
include pulse rate through a “shark ﬁn” hub implemented as
a small alteration of a standard computer mouse, an elec-
trodermal activity (EDA) sensor and a infrared temperature
sensor.
The remainder of this paper describes the basic AMBER
Shark-ﬁn Mouse set-up, together with the individual signals
used. We review how each signal was tested for accuracy,
both individually and as a complete system. The experi-
mental set-up and video-game is discussed, followed by the
results and ﬁnally our conclusion.
II. THE SHARK-FIN MOUSE
The humble mouse was ﬁrst introduced as a prototype as
early as 1963, by Douglas Engelbart and Bill English of the
Stanford Research Institute. Since its inception it has formed
the backbone of all HCI. The concept of an emotional mouse
has been explored before [14]. However, limitations of the
designs discussed in the Introduction hampered successful
adoption of such devices.
The Advanced Multi-modal Biometric Emotion Recogni-
tion (A.M.B.E.R.) project was developed to create a low-
cost, unobtrusive, physiology sensitive system, incorporat-
ing a minimal set of physiological sensors with a high
potential for affect detection. The AMBER system also
incorporates EEG and combines both hardware and software
algorithms that support affect detection. The AMBER Shark-
Fin biometric mouse, being part of the AMBER project, is
a fully functional computer mouse which can output three
physiological signals in real time. It allows biometric data
to be collected as the player naturally participates in a video
game. This allows the device to seamlessly blend into the
PC gaming environment.
The AMBER prototype produces two digital data-streams.
The ﬁrst is the mouse position data and the second is the
physiological affective data. Both mouse and data signals
can be read by a single computer or split into two separate
computer systems, for research purposes. For this paper, one
computer was used. To enable a mouse-driven emotion inter-
action device to be functional, a novel hardware approach
and design was needed. Preliminary testing demonstrated
that the middle ﬁnger was the optimum choice for a strong
blood ﬂow volume needed by the photoplethysmograph
(PPG) heart rate sensor. We observed that resting the wrist
on a desk while holding the mouse decreases the blood ﬂow
in the middle ﬁnger. It was observed that the amplitude of
the peaks in the pulse signal fell to a quarter of their initial
values. To overcome this issue, the mouse was designed so
as to provide support for the wrist (ﬁgure 2).
To maintain the mouse’s full functionality, the scroll-
wheel was moved from the centre ﬁnger (now being used for
a pulse) to the right or left side (depending on preference),
to be operated by the thumb, as shown in ﬁgure 2. To
assist in the stabilisation of the middle ﬁnger, and to house
both active component of the PPG, an arched housing was
designed in the centre of the mouse, in place of a standard
scroll-wheel. This also created a dark chamber to comply
with the PPG’s optical requirements.
The EDA sensors required the player to place a continuous
pressure on the electrodes in order to prevent artefacts.
Typical EDA devices place the electrodes between two
ﬁngers of the hand. Since the ﬁngers move during clicking
the mouse, the sensors were designed to connect with the
palm where the least amount of movement was likely. Two
1cm x 1cm square electrodes were situated 1cm apart on the
back of the mouse casing (ﬁgure 2).

To take account of any heat build-up invoked by ther-
mal contact, a contactless IR thermometer was used. The
temperature sensor was situated where it would receive a
continuous and steady air convection from the hand. To
assist further in heat build-up removal, the mouse casing was
designed to be open, allowing air to circulate the circuitry,
and the heat to dissipate naturally.
A. Signals
Many studies conﬁrm the importance of combining the
use of several physiological sensors to detect affect in video
games, as seen in table I.

The variation in heart rate is a good indicator of stress
and anxiety [13]. Using optical volumetric sensors known as
a photoplethysmograph, the waveform of the heart’s pulse
can be detected through a thin part of the body, typically the
ﬁnger or ear. The received signal produces a sharp peak in
the waveform for every beat of the heart. Shelley and Shelley
[28] demonstrate the wealth of information available through
a photoplethysmograph sensor.
Electrodermal Activity (EDA), also referred to as Gal-
vanic Skin Response (GSR), Skin Conductance Response
(SCR) or Psycho Galvanic Reﬂex (PGR), measures the
variance in electrical conductivity through the surface of the
skin. EDA readings are effected through the sympathetic
nervous system, making it a good indicator of stress and
anxiety. EDA suffers with latency, with a delay of approx-
imately one second for a response to be evoked, followed
by approximately three seconds for the effect to dissipate.
It is among the most basic and low cost physiological
modalities available, and is widely used in physiological
emotion recognition, including video games (table I).
Body temperature is affected by emotion, speciﬁcally joy,
anger and sadness [18][19], and has been used for emotion
recognition in video games. Temperature sensors fall into
two general types: contact and non contact. Both types are
sensitive to movement, which can introduce inaccuracies in
the data collected. Movement is an important issue in the
process of an active game play; hence, the positions of the
sensors have to be chosen carefully.
Temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. Other units of
measure are 3.3 volts used for both EDA and pulse data,
capped by rapid-prototyping board FEZ-mini; measuring
1000 units per volt. Thus the minimum value will always
be a positive integer or zero and the maximum value cannot
exceed the integer value of 3,300. We avoid the typical
contamination and artefacts through using capacitors in a
smoothing circuit, as well as short cables and on-board
computation.
III. EVALUATION
Prior to running experiments, each component was indi-
vidually evaluated to measure its performance against the
expected output values. Each component was tested for
minimum and maximum range and temporal responsiveness.
1) Temperature: The temperature sensor was expected to
accurately respond to variances in the temperature of the
skin. To test the range of the sensor, three objects with
extreme variations in temperature where presented to the IR
thermometer’s 90◦ ﬁeld-of-view (FOV), at an approximate
distance of 5.5mm. The objects used were ice, a hot coffee
pot and a human hand. The ice was taken from the freezer
drawer of a fridge. Due to the reﬂective properties of ice,
the ice-block was masked with a thin layer of paper. This
had the expected effect of marginally raising the surface
temperature. The same approach was used on the coffee-
pot, again slightly altering the temperature. However, these
alterations did not detract from the aim of the test, which was
to measure the response of the thermometer to temperature
changes. The objects where presented one after the other
to the IR-thermometers FOV. The system collected the
temperature data for 10 seconds and then paused for a key
press; while the next object was selected. The pause was
introduced to eliminate any danger when moving the hot-
coffee-pot, while maintaining a 30 second data window.
During this pause, the next object was presented, then the
data recording resumed with key press.
After all three objects had their temperature read, the
data was analysed, for range accuracy. Figure 3 shows the
temperature range over the 30 second interval. The expected

2) Photoplethysmograph: The photoplethysmograph sen-
sor comprises of a 3mm infrared (IR) light emitting diode
(LED) and a 3mm phototransistor. The sensor is required
to optically detect blood volume, entering and leaving the
middle ﬁnger. To test the functioning range of the sensor, a
dense light blocking/absorbing card was used to completely
block the light emanating from the IR-LED. When in situ,
no light was able to enter the phototransistor and therefore
no current should ﬂow through the phototransistor. When
the card was removed, the full range of light was passed
to the phototransistor and the maximum current should be
produced. The minimum and maximum voltage levels are
0-volts and 3.3-volts, respectively. The 3.3-volt is governed
by the 3.3-volt analogue input cap of the devices circuitry.
The card was placed in front of the sensor for approximately
5 seconds then removed for 5 seconds repeatedly, for a total
duration of 30 seconds. Figure 4 depicts the recorded data.

3) Electrodermal Activity (EDA): To assess the function
of the EDA sensors, a simple hand test was conducted.
The palm of the right hand was placed on and off the
device making contact with the two sensors, at intervals of
approximately ﬁve seconds. The test began with the sensor
untouched. This procedure was repeated for 30 seconds.

4) Complete system test: After ascertaining the minimum
and maximum ranges, a trial was made to determine the
ability of the sensors at detecting all signals together when
applying the hand onto the device. For this test, all three
sensors were recorded without any contact for approximately
10 seconds. After that, the right hand was placed on the
mouse, covering both EDA and temperature sensors with the
palm of the hand, and the middle ﬁnger was placed inside
the photoplethysmograph cover. Figure 6 demonstrates the
system’s ability to pick up all three signals simultaneously.
As expected the heart signal takes several seconds for the
capacitors driving the ampliﬁcation to ﬁnd the pulse. After
that, the pulse is cleanly detected. The EDA responded as
expected with a small rise in current as soon as the sensors
made contact with the skin. Similarly, the temperature sensor
detected the change in temperature, from room temperature
to skin temperature, almost immediately.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL VIDEO-GAME
After completing the individual sensor function tests, a
simple video game was created to test the device’s ability
to detect basic affect in a gaming environment. The game
involved moving the mouse over a randomly appearing white

path to the white square. The game set-up and the layout
of the screen are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
The game was speciﬁcally developed to invoke mild levels
of stress. This was done by limiting the player’s ability to
freely move the mouse, while at the same time maintaining
a need to move the mouse as quick as possible to gain a
higher score within the countdown period. To achieve this,
a mouse speedometer was created that limited the player’s
ability to score. If the mouse was moved at normal speeds,
the scoring potential was reduced. If the players move the
mouse quickly the energy level was reduced. If the energy
bar became depleted, one of three lives was lost (Figure 8).
The game ended after the counter reached zero or all three
lives were lost.

The data was recorded using two ﬁles. The ﬁrst stored
the computer game event data. The second recorded the
biometric sensor data. For each ﬁle an epoch time-stamp was
stored along with each iterative data point to enable temporal
comparisons of the game-play and biometric data. To begin
the experiment, the player placed their hand on the mouse
and were given the rules of the game. The game commenced

state-of-play and game triggered-events were recoded to a
text ﬁle, approximately every tenth of a second. Similarly
the raw signals from the biometric sensors were collected
through MATLAB along with the epoch time stamp, at
approximately two tenths of a millisecond.
V. RESULTS
The results of the trial highlight the effectiveness of the
device at measuring clean physiological signals from a fully
functional mouse, while playing a video-game. Figure 9

Typical physiological data output
at emotion recognition, we carried out off-line analyses of
the data. The data consisted of the three variables (Pulse
rate, GSR and skin temperature) measured along the whole
approximately 90-second long game run. Each value in the
sequence was the average of the previous 3 seconds of the
signal. The pulse signal was transformed into pulse rate by
the following steps:
1) The raw curve was smoothed with a window of 1/2 a
second and then with a window of 1 second.
2) The locations of the peaks in the signal were identiﬁed.
3) The intervals between the subsequent peak locations
was used to approximate the heart rate.
4) A linear interpolation was used to set the heart rate
values between the peaks.
Two categories were formed. Assuming that the player is
in state ‘Calm’ during most of the game run, we hypothe-
sised that certain situations would provoke a negative state
which we labelled ‘Agitated’. In this experiment, a state was
labelled as ‘Agitated’ if all of the following held:
• The speed of the mouse exceeds a threshold of 200.
• The countdown clock indicates less than 25 seconds
left.
• The player has lost at least one life thus far.
For example, game #3 produced 4129 data points, 56 of
which were labelled ‘Agitated’ (3.78%), while the remaining
points were labelled ‘Calm’. After removing the outliers
(GSR signal less than 500 and temperature signal less than
50), and concatenating all 20 games, we obtained a labelled
data set with 60,684 data points with 5332 data points
(8.79%) in class ‘Agitated’. The task of developing a proper
real-time classiﬁer for such an imbalanced data set is one
of our future lines of research. Here we are interested to
ﬁnd whether there are differences between the distributions
of the two classes. A histogram was calculated for each of
the three features and each class. The polygons of these
histograms are shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12.

increased level of anxiety [13], which demonstrates the
ability of the proposed device to output genuine and useful
signals.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this study, we identiﬁed the need for a simple input
device capable of streaming real-time physiological data.
We proposed a novel solution, named the “Shark-ﬁn Mouse”
(due to the shape of the hub housing the plethysmograph).
The mouse outputs three signals: pulse, electrodermal activ-
ity (EDA, often termed Galvanic Skin Response or GSR)
and the skin temperature. Compared to the existing devices,
the Shark-ﬁn Mouse has the advantage of producing clean
and reliable signals in real time in a subtle way. The Shark-
ﬁn mouse retains full functionality as a mouse, while hosting
sensors positioned so as to ensure maximum robustness
of the signals. Our tests and experiments demonstrated
that the Shark-ﬁn Mouse is capable of streaming the three
physiological signals during a real game play.
The proposed device opens up interesting future research
avenues. First, the Shark-ﬁn Mouse was intended as a part of
the A.M.B.E.R. project. The system will include additional
affective modalities such as EEG and facial expression
recognition. Second, we aimed at designing a device with a
wide range of applications, including psychology, medicine,
business, and entertainment industry. Data can be collected
in different experimental environments. Due to the ability
of the device to stream data in real time, experiments with
emotional feedback can be carried out. The device can be
turned into a useful gaming accessory because of its low
cost and simplicity of concept and operation. It has to be
mentioned that the Shark-ﬁn Mouse is only a prototype at
this stage. However, with the rise of the interest in affective
computing we are planning to work towards wider academic
and commercial deployment of the Shark-ﬁn mouse.
