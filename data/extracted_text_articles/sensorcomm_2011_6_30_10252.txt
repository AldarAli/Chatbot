Abstract—When discussing powering wireless sensor net-
work nodes, there are a few major energy consumers: com-
munications, microcontroller and the sensor. We propose a
wireless sensor network platform architecture minimizing the
energy consumption of sensing. The architecture proposed
herein is based on a reactive approach to sensing. A number
of possible hardware approaches are evaluated and compared.
This comparison indicates that analog storage between the
sensing element and the sensor electronics can be a feasible
method for reducing the energy consumption of the system.
Keywords-low power WSN sensing; WSN node architecture;
wireless sensor network node.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the most common questions regarding wireless
sensor networks, WSN, is what the power consumption at
the sensor node must be. Much work has been done on low-
powered sensor nodes and their communication abilities: see,
for example, [1]–[7]. Some speciﬁc examples are schemes
handling the reduction of communication [8], effective rout-
ing and multihop schemes, and the reactive partial waking
up of WSN nodes [9].
Most often, the sensing element itself is disregarded from
an energy budget point of view. The current state of the
art for sensor interfacing is to convert the sensor data to
digital form. The most common approach is using an A/D
converter. Other well known approaches involves letting the
sensor data inﬂuence a digital pulse train of which we easily
can measure parameters like frequency, pulse width or duty
cycle. None of these approaches puts the power consumption
of the sensor into focus. All of these approaches are based
on the assumption that all data should be transfered to some
computational stage on the WSN node or any device higher
up in the system architecture.
In this paper, we propose an architecture for low power
interfacing of a sensing element to a WSN node. The
architecture exploits the idea of detecting no or discardable
changes in data. Such detection should then inhibit further
processing of sensor data as early as possible. The proposed
architecture is based on a reactive wake-up chain starting at
the sensing element itself.

A. WSN node architecture
The basis for this WSN node architecture is the deter-
mination of changes in sensing element data as early as
possible. In many real systems data changes are small and
are most often not of interest to the surrounding system.
From an energy consumption point of view, we like to
keep as much of the WSN node asleep as possible when
determining whether a data sample constitutes a signiﬁcant
change compared with the previous sample.
Consider a WSN node architecture as in Figure 1. The
most frequently used approach is to read the data into the
µP store and compare it with the previous data. Energy is
spent on sensing element sampling, signal ampliﬁcation and
ﬁltering, A/D conversion and data comparison in the µP.

and comparison logic.
The next opportunity for comparison is by adding a digital
memory and comparison function after the A/D conversion,
as shown in Figure 2. Energy is spent on sensor sampling,
signal ampliﬁcation and ﬁltering, A/D conversion and stor-
age and comparison of the data in digital memory. Enabling

the µP to sleep while performing sensor data sampling if
there are no changes or small changes in sensor data will
use energy only for the HW cost of digital memory, some
conﬁgurable logic (to allow for the setting of change limits)
and sending a wake-up signal to the µP.

comparison logic before the A/D conversion.
In terms of energy cost here, the A/D conversion is the
most power-hungry process. Can we bypass A/D conversion
as well? A possibility for this is given in Figure 3. Here,
we introduce analog memory with the capability of storing
and comparing at least two values with associated logic
and signaling to the µP. HW developments supporting this
architecture using charge-coupled device technology, or ccd,
were made available in the seventies [10]. Recently, new
ﬁndings presented by Borg and Johansson [11] indicate that
ccd technology implemented in standard CMOS processes
exhibits properties supporting the proposed architecture.
Energy is spent on sensor sampling, signal ampliﬁcation and
ﬁltering and analog storage (ccd) and associated logic. Thus,
A/D conversion and the µP can sleep during sensing element
data sampling if there are no changes or small changes in
the sensed data.
II. ENERGY ANALYSIS OF THE ARCHITECTURE
To analyze the energy consumption of the presented
architectures, we will use two different sensing situations:
• Temperature sensing using a PT100 element as the
sensing element
• Ultrasound pulse echo measurement using piezo ce-
ramic transducers as sensing elements
This analysis is conducted using published state-of-the-art
data (from our group and others) and data from commercial
devices. In this way, we can build an accurate picture of
the total energy consumption of the proposed architectures.
No circuit simulations are made here, nor have we built any
complete devices.
The energy analysis is based on the following model. The
total electrical power Ptot consumed by a WSN node can
be described as:
Ptot = Psens + Pcond + PA−mem + PAD + PD−mem + PµP
(1)
The total energy usage is then obtained by introducing the
time needed for each operation (after which it can be turned
off). To make the analysis reasonably simple, we assume
that the architecture supports turning off Esens, Econd, once
data has been stored either in analog or digital form.
For data sampling from one sensor, we assume a sensing
and conditioning time tsenscond, an analog storing time
tA−mem, an A/D time tAD, a digital memory time tD−mem
and a µP time tµP . Thus, we obtain the total power Etot
used for data sampling from one sensor as:
Etot = Psens ∗ tsens + Pcond ∗ tcond + PA−mem ∗ tA−mem+
PAD ∗ tAD + PD−mem ∗ tD−mem + PµP ∗ tµP
(2)
Provided that we have some understanding of the real
values of these energies and times, we can calculate the total
power consumption. In the following equation, we will do
this for two sensor types, a PT-100 sensor and an ultrasonic
pulse echo sensor, for each of the three architecture types
A1, (see Figure 1), A2 (see Figure 2), and A3 (see Figure
3).
A. Energy analysis PT-100 sensor
In this case, we assume the power consumption and time
needed for a PT-100 sensor and its associated electronics,
according to table I. For each of the three different archi-
tectures in Figures 1-3, we then calculate the expected span
of energy consumption (see Figure 4).

B. Energy analysis ultrasound sensor
Here, we discuss the power consumption and time needed
for a piezo electric transducer in an ultrasound pulse echo
system. A typical pulse echo measuring situation with
typical sound signals is shown in Figure 5. In table II,
the power consumption and related timing for the sensor
and associated electronics areis given. For each of the
three different architectures A1-A3 of Figure 1-3, we then
calculate the expected span of (maximum and minimum)
energy consumption (see Figure 6).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Under the assumptions that we made, we have compiled
energy consumption data for two sensing scenarios. These
data are shown in Figures 4 and 6. It is obvious that the µP
uses a large amount of energy. Thus, any architecture that

can avoid waking up the µP has clear advantages from an
energy consumption point of view.
It is also clear that in a sensing situation with a dynamic
sensor signal, such as ultrasound, avoiding A/D conversion
is a promising approach. If analog memory and comparison
techniques can be developed similar to what we have seen
for A/D converters, analog storage architecture will be a
strong contender forin future WSN designs.
IV. CONCLUSION
The reactive architecture proposed here for minimal en-
ergy consumption of sensing on WSN platforms is promis-
ing. Based on an analysis of current state-of-the-art sen-
sor interface electronics, an approach using analog storage
provides interesting data when compared with more mature
technology such as ADC:s and memory logic.
Future work will reveal whether if a reactive architecture
based on an analog storage approach will show improve-
ments in energy consumption similar to those of advanced
ADC. If such improvements are shown, the analog storage
approach has clear merit for use in future WSN node
designs.
