Abstract—Multiuser
multiple-input
multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) transmission scheme has drawn most attentions
during the recent development of Long Term Evolution (LTE)
systems. Based on the feedback information of the downlink
channel, evolved NodeB may achieve multiple accesses via
MIMO technology in MU-MIMO Transmission Mode and
allow user equipments to share resources in frequency and
time domain. In this paper, we review several signal detectors
and evaluate their performance in MU-MIMO transmission.
The review work aims at the feasibility study of receivers
in LTE systems. Different scenarios have been considered in
the evaluation progress, e.g. low and high spatial correlation,
real channel estimation and feedback delay. Simulation results
show that beneﬁts can be obtained by MU-MIMO transmission
in the spatial correlated MIMO channel due to the higher
condition number in the channel. Besides, reviewed receivers
with the co-channel interference-aware signal detection yield
good performance compared with single user MIMO receivers.
The interference aware receivers are also robust in MU-MIMO
transmission
with
imperfect
working
conditions,
including
channel estimation errors and precoding matrix index feedback
delay.

I. INTRODUCTION
LTE (Long Term Evolution) is the trademarked project name
of a high performance air interface for cellular telephone.
It is a project of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) for a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS), hence is termed as E-
UTRA (Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access). The LTE
speciﬁcations [1] provide downlink peak rates of at least 300
Mbit/s, an uplink of at least 150 Mbit/s associated with 20
MHz channel bandwidth and RAN round-trip time of less
than 10 ms. Scalable carrier bandwidths, from 1.4 MHz to
20 MHz, and both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and
time division duplexing (TDD) are supported in LTE.
The key technologies in LTE systems are Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) [2] in the
downlink and Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple
Access (SC-FDMA) [3] for uplink transmission. Furthermore,
Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) is considered for increas-
ing system capacity in LTE, facilitating spatial multiplexing
(SM) and Alamouti based transmit diversity (TxD) schemes.
Besides single user MIMO (SU-MIMO) Transmission Modes,
multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission is supported as
well. MU-MIMO allows base station (eNodeB) to communi-
cate with different radio terminals simultaneously by means
of space division multiple access, whereas SU-MIMO only
considers access to multiple antennas at a single terminal.
The beneﬁt of MU-MIMO transmission is the naturally inde-
pendent signals cross the antennas mounted at different UEs,
which are physically distributed. This allows less restriction
on the MIMO channel condition for applying MIMO tech-
nology in signal transmission, whereas SU-MIMO requires
good uncorrelated signals between antennas at the same user
equipment (UE) for SM transmission scheme. MU-MIMO
transmission is realized with the precoding and UE pairing in
LTE systems, where different precoding matrices or vectors
[1] are reported by the paired UEs via feedback channel.
In this paper, we look at different signal receivers and
evaluate their performance in MU-MIMO transmission in LTE
systems. Related work has been carried out in e.g. [4] and
[5] for performance evaluation in system-level. In contrast,
we focus on the receiver structures and evaluation of their
performance in link-level with realistic working conditions,
e.g. channel estimation error, closed-loop feedback delay and
different modulation and coding schemes. The aim of the
evaluation is to review the reliability and robustness of dif-
ferent receivers in MU-MIMO transmission and to exploit the
potential beneﬁts of MU-MIMO transmission in LTE systems
compared with SU-MIMO scheme.
In what follows, complex base band notation will be used,
deploying matrix vector calculus, for describing the system
structure and the signal processing. Discrete-time variables
will be denoted by vectors which are given as lower case
characters in bold face italics. Matrices will be denoted by
upper case characters in bold face italics. Complex values will
be underlined. Furthermore, (·)H denotes the Hermitian of a
vector or a matrix, I is the identity matrix and E {·} gives the
expectation value of given random variables. ℜ {·} and ℑ {·}
denote the real and the image parts of the given complex value,
respectively.
The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II gives an overview of the LTE system with focus on
the precoding matrix index feedback and UE pairing scheme
in MU-MIMO transmission. Different MIMO receivers are

discussed in Section III. Section IV summarizes the perfor-
mance of the receivers in MU-MIMO transmission in different
working scenarios in LTE systems. Section V concludes this
paper.
II. LTE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
A. System Model
We consider 3GPP 36-series speciﬁcations for LTE systems
as the baseline for our following discussions. As presented
in [6], the system constructed by the LTE physical layer
technologies, namely the OFDMA and MIMO, approaches to
a bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system [7]. This
yields transmissions of the source bits in LTE systems are
independent and meet the channel with same quality. The
mutual information between transmitted and received bits is
maximized in such systems. In what follows, a general system
concept of LTE is presented with NT transmit (Tx) antennas,
NR receive (Rx) antennas and NL transmission layers (the
parallel spatial data streams). Owing to the orthogonality be-
tween the subcarriers in each OFDM symbol, we can represent
the subcarrier speciﬁc SU-MIMO transmission in a single-tap
channel scenario in LTE systems by
r = H P d + n,
(1)
where r ∈ CNR represents the received signal vector, H ∈
CNR×NT the MIMO channel matrix, P ∈ CNT×NL the ap-
plied precoding matrix, d ∈ CNL the transmitted signal vector
and n ∈ CNR the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
vector at the receiver. Without loss of generality, mutually
uncorrelated signal elements are assumed in the transmitted
signal vector with covariance matrix Rd = EsI and n is a
zero mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (ZMCSCG)
random vector with n ∼ CN(0, N0I). We further deﬁne
the elements in d are drawn from a quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) constellation M = 2Q, where Q is the
number of bits per symbol.
We consider MU-MIMO transmission with NUE UEs by
adding (NUE − 1) UE signals into the downlink transmission.
The received signals at the kth UE can be represented by,
rk =
NUE
X
nUE=1
Hk P nUE dnUE + nk,
(2)
with mutually independent data from different UEs.
Different transmission modes are supported in LTE sys-
tems. Transmission Mode 2 and 3 are used for open-loop
transmissions with TxD and SM [6] [8], respectively. Trans-
mission Mode 4, 5 and 6 are related to the closed-loop
transmission with precoding matrix index (PMI) feedback
for SU-MIMO SM, MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO with single
layer, respectively. In the context of this paper, we concentrate
our discussion on Transmission Mode 5 and for the reference
purpose Transmission Mode 6.
For Transmission Mode 6 in LTE systems, we represent the
system function by setting in NL = 1 (1)
r = H p d + n,
(3)
in which the precoding matrix is degraded to be a precoding
vector p ∈ CNT×1.
For Transmission Mode 5, MU-MIMO transmission, two
UEs with single layer to each UE are scheduled in LTE
systems [8]. Using (2) and setting NUE = 2, we can represent
the system function for the kth UE by
rk = Hk p1 d1 + Hk p2 d2 + nk, k = 1, 2.
(4)
B. Spatial Channel Model
For benchmarking, 3GPP introduced spatial channel model
(SCM) in [9]. In particular, Section A1 and A2 of [9] provide
guidelines for the SCM simulations by setting out from the
general concept of [10]. In [9] four representative SCM test
cases including antenna conﬁgurations and realistic antenna
correlation properties are introduced, also explicitly consider-
ing antenna polarization. The SCM test case SCM-A refers to
the suburban macro propagation, SCM-B and SCM-C consider
the urban macro cellular environment with either low or wide
angle spreads, and SCM-D reﬂects the case of an urban micro
cellular scenario. In the context of this paper, we consider the
SCM-B and SCM-D test cases as the baseline to evaluate the
system performance of MU-MIMO transmission.
C. PMI Selection
As speciﬁed in [6] [8], the closed-loop principle has been
introduced in LTE systems downlink transmission by reporting
back different information from UE to the eNodeB through
the uplink channel in a periodic or aperiodic fashion [8]. The
feedback information, the PMI, provides information about the
preferred precoding matrix in a codebook based precoding [6].
The reported PMIs from UE help the eNodeB inquiring the
knowledge of the downlink channel state information (CSI).
Using the channel information a UE severed by eNodeB may
ﬁnd the most suitable precoding matrix which aligns own
signals to the own downlink channel state. This procedure
helps UEs in both Transmission Mode 5 and Transmission
Mode 6 to improve the desired received signal energy. Consid-
ering a single transmission layer per UE in those two modes,
we conclude that a matched ﬁlter (MF) based receiver with
maximum likelihood (ML) decision rule will maximize the
signal strength for the target UE without prerequisite of the
knowledge of Transmission Mode [11]. The MF receiver can
be represented by the ﬁlter vector
mH
k =

, k = 1, 2.
(5)
The corresponding post processing signal to noise ratio (Post-
SNR) is given by
γMF =
Hk pk

2
γ, k = 1, 2,
(6)
with γ being the SNR at each receiver antenna. The most
suitable PMI will be selected to maximize the Post-SNR at the
output of the MF receiver. Therefore, we may represent the

selection of the best precoding vector p by using the following
maximum Post-SNR criterion
pk = arg max
pi∈P
Hk pi

2
, k = 1, 2,
(7)
with P being the corresponding codebook for particular num-
ber of Tx antennas [6].
The above discussion gives the precoding matrix selection in
a particular subcarrier. However, the more interesting scenario
of PMI selection in LTE systems is the wideband selection due
to the limitation of the uplink channel capacity for feedbacks.
The wideband PMI selection requires one preferred precoding
matrix being selected for a group of subcarriers in LTE
systems [8]. The extension of (7) for the wideband precoding
matrix selection in a bandwidth of BPMI including Nsubc
subcarriers is

with Hk,j being the subcarrier speciﬁc MIMO channel matrix
in the jth subcarrier at the kth UE and RTx being the
estimated transmitter antenna correlation matrix based on the
channel matrices in Nsubc subcarriers [12].
D. UE Pairing in MU-MIMO
A good UE pairing scheme is required at the eNodeB to
choose the correct pair of UEs for MU-MIMO transmission
in LTE systems. This pairing scheme shall maintain less inter-
ference between scheduled UEs in MU-MIMO transmission.
A proper pairing scheme can be designed by maximizing the
Chordal distance between the feedback precoding matrices of
the UEs. The Chordal distance between two matrices is given
in [13] and represented by
dchord(pi, pj) =
1
√
2
pi pH
i − pj pH
j

F
(8)
with ∥·∥F being the Frobenius norm of the matrix.
The Chordal distance generalizes the distance between
points on the unit sphere through an isometric embedding
from complex Grassmann manifold G(NT, NL) to the unit
sphere [13]. Assuming an inﬁnite number of UEs served by the
current eNodeB, the kth UE with reported precoding matrix pk
will be paired with the mth UE, where the mth UE reports
precoding matrix pm and the Chordal distance between pk
and pm is maximized. With the maximized Chordal distance
criterion pm stays in the antipolar position of pk and hence
∥Hk pm∥2 is minimized yielding the minimized inter-UE
interference in (4).
In summary, the UE pairing scheme for MU-MIMO trans-
mission in LTE systems can be designed in the way of ﬁnding
the mth UE for the kth UE based on the reported precoding
matrices and the following criterion,
pm = arg max
pi∈PUE

(9)
with PUE being the pool containing all reported precoding
matrices at a certain eNodeB.
III. RECEIVER DESIGN FOR MU-MIMO
Typical receivers in a MIMO-OFDM system for spatial
multiplexing transmission can be categorized with their signal
processing styles, e.g. non-linear and linear receivers [14].
We extend the structure of those receivers for MU-MIMO
transmission in this section. Considering the symmetric system
function faced by both UEs in MU-MIMO transmission, we
simplify our discussion on the receiver structure for the ﬁrst
UE, i.e. k = 1 in (4). With the deﬁnitions of the effective
channel matrix
ge = H1 p1,
(10)
and the interference channel matrix
gt = H1 p2,
(11)
we represent (4) by
r1 = ge d1 + gt d2 + n1.
(12)
A. Linear Block Receiver
The linear block receiver with zero-forcing (ZF) or mini-
mum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion applies linear ﬁlter
on the received signal vector r1 to compensate the channel
distortion and the inter-symbol interference. The output signal
vector is the product of the linear ﬁlter matrix and the received
signals
˜d1 = mH r1.
(13)
The ﬁlter m is constructed as
mH
ZF =

gH

(14)
with ZF criterion and
mH
MMSE =

gH
e ge + 1
γ

(15)
with MMSE criterion. Due to the single transmission layer
per UE in MU-MIMO transmission, we conclude that a linear
block receiver with either ZF or MMSE criterion yields the
same system performance as the MF ﬁlter in MU-MIMO
transmission. In (6) the Post-SNR at the output of linear block
receivers is calculated. Using the linear block receiver, the
UE assumes that interference coming from the paired UE
via gt are fully suppressed. However with low resolution or
size limited codebooks in LTE, the residual interference is
still signiﬁcant strong and causes an error ﬂoor of the signal
detection at the ﬁrst UE. Non-perfect working condition such
as feedback delay and channel estimation error will cause more
performance degradation.

B. Interference Rejection Combiner
Taking the remaining interference in the received signal
vector into account, the receiver can be built in a fashion
of suppressing interference and improving the Post-SNR. The
interference aware receiver, such as the interference rejection
combiner (IRC) in [15] is designed in this manner. We
represent the IRC receiver structure in LTE systems here.
Following [15], the general IRC structure for the received
signal is

Transmission Mode. With CQI = 4, i.e. QPSK modulation,
the MF receiver provides similar performance as the other re-
ceivers. However, for large CQI values, the MF receiver faces
error ﬂoor. More than 50% blocks cannot be decoded success-
fully by the MF receiver with CQI = 10 and CQI = 13. The
MF receiver is unaware of the co-channel interference given
by the interferer UE in MU-MIMO transmission and hence
suffers the strong degradation caused by the interference. Such
co-channel interference increases when the modulation order
increases. Similar to the MF receiver, the IRC receiver deploys
linear operation as well and has quite similar performance
as the Max-Log-MAP receiver. The maximum performance
difference between the IRC and Max-Log-MAP receivers is
about 1 dB and 2 dB at BLER = 10−2 in 3 km/h and 30 km/h
scenarios, respectively. Compared with the lower UE velocity,
the higher UE velocity shifts the receiver performance by 2 dB
for both IRC and Max-Log-MAP receivers. This is caused by
the mismatching between the reported optimal PMI and the
real channel matrices when the precoding matrices are applied.
The higher the UE velocity is, the stronger is the mismatching,
and therefore the worse is the receiver performance. However,
this impact is limited by 2 dB from 3 km/h to 30 km/h which
is acceptable for real systems. Comparing the performance
between the Transmission Mode 5 and Transmission Mode 6,
we conclude that the co-channel interference causes signiﬁ-
cant performance loss in Transmission Mode 5. The increased
modulation order (e.g. CQI = 10 or 13) generates stronger
interference and therefore causes more performance loss in
Transmission Mode 5. However, this loss can be compen-
sated by serving more UEs in Transmission Mode 5 than in
Transmission Mode 6, yielding a higher system throughput.
Figure 3 presents the performance of different receivers
under the SCM-B 4×2 scenario with the same system settings
as in Figure 1. The MF receiver still suffers large performance
degradation or error ﬂoor issue in SCM-B channel. Due to the
higher spatial correlation in SCM-B than in SCM-D both the
IRC and the Max-Log-MAP receivers obtain 1 to 2 dB gain
at BLER = 10−2 in SCM-B channel. This can be explained
that each UE in MU-MIMO transmission receives the desired
signal only through single layer, which may be aligned to the
better sub-channel associated with the dominated eigenvalue
from the channel matrix. The stronger spatial correlation yields
a larger condition number. That means the UE obtains more
channel gain for the desired signals and has less interference
from the co-channel interferer UE, which leads to higher signal
to interference and noise ratio (SINR) per subcarrier. However,

this performance gain vanishes with CQI = 13. In this case,
there is less coding gain due to the higher modulation order
and higher code rate. The potential performance gain given
by the improved SINR in higher correlation scenarios cannot
compensate the loss given by strong frequency selectivity in
SCM-B channel, which has longer power delay proﬁle than
SCM-D.
Instead of using ideal channel knowledge, performances of
receivers in Figure 4 are presented by using the real channel
estimator. Besides that, the delay between the PMI selection
and applying the corresponding precoding matrices at the
transmitter is set to be 8 subframes instead of 1 subframe. Un-
der these real working conditions both the IRC and the Max-
log-MAP receivers have 2 to 3 dB performance degradation
compared to the results in Figure 3. This degradation is caused
by the channel estimation error and the mismatching between
the reported optimal PMI and the real channel matrices when
the precoding matrices are applied (similar effects caused by
high UE velocity). However, the IRC receiver still has quite
similar performance as the Max-Log-MAP receiver under
those non-perfect working conditions. Therefore we conclude

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the system performance in
MU-MIMO transmission with different receivers in LTE sys-
tems. In addition, we presented the Max-SNR based simple
PMI selection and the maximum Chordal distance based UE
pairing criteria for MU-MIMO transmission. It has been shown
that receivers with consideration of the co-channel interfer-
ence, e.g. the IRC and Max-Log-MAP receivers, provide
good performance in MU-MIMO transmission with perfect
or non-perfect working conditions (channel estimation error
and feedback delay), whereas the simple linear ﬁlter receiver
faces large performance degradation or error ﬂoor issue. It has
been demonstrated that a spatial correlated scenario helps the
receivers to obtain the performance gain by eliminating the
co-channel interference in MU-MIMO transmission.
