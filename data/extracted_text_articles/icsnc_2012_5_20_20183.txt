Abstract—Previously, We proposed an efficient algorithm 
using vector quantization (VQ) histogram for facial image 
recognition in low-frequency DCT domains. It can be 
considered that this algorithm is essential for utilizing the 
phase information of DCT coefficients by applying binary 
quantization on the DCT coefficient blocks. In this paper, we 
newly utilize energy histogram so as to add magnitude 
information of DCT coefficients. These two histograms, which 
contain both phase and magnitude information of a DCT 
transformed facial image, are utilized as a very effective 
personal value. Publicly available AT&T database is used for 
the evaluation of our proposed algorithm, which is consisted of 
40 subjects with 10 images per subject containing variations in 
lighting, posing, and expressions. It is demonstrated that face 
recognition using combined histogram-based features of DCT 
coefficients in low frequency domains can achieve much higher 
recognition rate.  
Keywords-Face recognition; Vector quantizaiton (VQ); 
Energy histogram; DCT coefficients. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Face recognition has been hot research topic for two 
decades due to its potential applications in many fields such 
as law enforcement applications, security applications and 
video indexing, etc. Many algorithms have been proposed 
for solving face recognition problem [1]-[11]. These 
algorithms can be roughly divided to two categories, namely, 
statistics-based and structure-based approaches. Statistics-
based approaches [5], [6], [7] attempt to capture and define 
the face as a whole. The face is treated as a two dimensional 
pattern of intensity variation. Under this approach, the face is 
matched through finding its underlying statistical regularities. 
Based on the use of the Karhunen-Loeve transform, PCA [5] 
is used to represent a face in terms of an optimal coordinate 
system which contains the most significant eigenfaces and 
the mean square error is minimal. However, it is highly 
complicated and computational-power hungry, making it 
difficult to implement them into real-time face recognition 
applications. Structure-based approach [3], [4] uses the 
relationship between facial features, such as the locations of 
eye, mouth and nose. It can implement very fast, but 
recognition rate usually depends on the location accuracy of 
facial features, so it cannot give a satisfied recognition result. 
There are many other algorithms have been used for face 
recognition, such as Local Feature Analysis (LFA) [11], 
neural network [1], local autocorrelations and multi-scale 
integration technique [2], and other techniques have been 
proposed. 
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is not only widely 
used in many image and video compression standards [12], 
but also for pattern recognition as a means of feature 
extraction [13]-[21]. The main merit of the DCT is its 
relationship to the KLT [18]. It has been demonstrated that 
DCT best approach KLT [23], but DCT can be 
computationally more efficient than the KLT depending on 
the size of the KLT basis set. 
In our previous work [27], we present a simple, yet 
highly reliable face recognition algorithm using vector 
quantization (VQ) method for facial image recognition in 
compressed DCT domain. Feature vectors of facial image are 
firstly generated by using DCT coefficients in low frequency 
domains. Then codevector referred count histogram, which is 
utilized as a very effective facial feature value, is obtained by 
VQ processing.  
This algorithm can be considered utilizing the phase 
information of DCT coefficients by applying binary 
quantization on the DCT coefficient blocks. If we could add 
magnitude information of DCT coefficients, the composite 
features of face are expected to be more robust and effective. 
In this paper, we utilize energy histogram to represent 
magnitude features of DCT coefficients. These two 
histograms, which contain both phase and magnitude 
information of a DCT transformed facial image, are utilized 
as a very effective personal value. Recognition results with 
different type of histogram features are first obtained 
separately and then combined by weighted averaging. 
This paper is organized as follows. A brief introduction 
to DCT as well as energy histogram is given in Section II. 
Our proposed face recognition method will be described in 
detail in Section III. Experimental results will be discussed in 
Section IV.  Finally, we make a conclusion in Section V.

B. Face recognition using Binary vector quantization in 
low-frequency DCT domains 
In our previous work [27], we proposed a feature 
extraction algorithm for face recognition using binary vector 
quantization (VQ) to generate feature vectors of facial 
image from DCT (Discrete Cosine transform) coefficients in 
low frequency domains. 
First, low-pass filtering is carried out using 2-D moving 
filter.  Block segmentation step, in which facial image is 
divided into small image blocks with an overlap, namely, by 
sliding dividing-partition one pixel by one pixel, is the 
following. Then the pixels in the image blocks (typical size 
is 8x8) are transformed using DCT according to the 
equation (1).  
A typical sample of transformed block is shown in 
Figure 1. The DCT coefficients of the image block are then 
used to form a feature vector. From left to right and top to 
bottom, the frequency of coefficients changes from low to 
high as shown in Figure 1. Because low frequency 
component is more effective for recognition, we only use 
the coefficients on the left and above to extract features. The 
equation for calculation is shown below. 
 
a[0] = AC01; 
a[1] = AC11; 
a[2] = AC10;  
 
 
 
     (4) 
a[3] = (AC02 + AC03 + AC12 + AC13) / 4; 
a[4] = (AC22 + AC23 + AC32 + AC33) / 4; 
a[5] = (AC20 + AC21 + AC30 + AC31) / 4 
 
where a[i] is the element of extracted feature vector, and 
d[i][j] is the coefficient value at point (i, j), respectively. 
After that, quantization of the feature vectors is 
implemented. There are only 2 types of value for each a[i], 
so the number of combination of 6-dimensional vector is 64, 
which is very easy and fast to be determined. The number of 
vectors with same index number is counted and feature 
vector histogram is easily generated, and it is used as 
histogram feature of the facial image. In the registration 
procedure, this histogram is saved in a database as personal 
identification information.  In the recognition procedure, the 
histogram made from an input facial image is compared 
with registered individual histograms and the best match is 
output as recognition result. 
 
C. Energy histogram 
A color histogram is obtained by counting the number of 
times a color occurs in an image. Similar to a color 
histogram, an energy histogram of the DCT coefficients is 
created by counting the number of times an energy level 
appears in a DCT blocks set of a DCT compressed image. 
An energy histogram (hc) [30] of an 8x8 DCT block for a 
particular color component can be written as:

with Q(F[u,v]) denotes the dequantized coefficient’s 
energy level at the u,v location.  
Energy histogram has been used in image retrieval in [30], 
and also reported to be used for face recognition algorithm 
[31].

PROPOSED METHOD 
As described in Section II (B), we have proposed a face 
recognition algorithm by applying binary quantization on the 
low-frequency 
DCT 
coefficient 
blocks, 
which 
was 
demonstrated to be effective for face recognition by 
experimental results. Actually, it can be thought that phase 
information of low-frequency DCT coefficients is extracted 
by this algorithm. If we could add magnitude information of 
DCT coefficients, the composite features of face are 
expected to be more robust and effective. 
We utilize energy histogram to represent magnitude 
features of DCT coefficients. In this paper, we propose an

coefficients (used as phase information)

improved face recognition algorithm using combined 
histogram-based features. Figure 2 shows proposed face 
recognition process steps. First, low-pass filtering is carried 
out using 2-D moving filter. This low-pass filtering is 
essential for reducing high-frequency noise and extracting 
most effective low frequency component for recognition.   
Block segmentation step, in which facial image is divided 
into small image blocks with an overlap, namely, by sliding 
dividing-partition one pixel by one pixel, is the following. 
Then the pixels in the image blocks (typical size is 8x8) are 
transformed using DCT according to the equation (1). After 
generations of low-frequency DCT coefficients, binary 
quantization of the feature vectors is implemented as 
described in Section II (B), and then VQ histogram of low-
frequency DCT coefficients is created.  
On the other hand, energy histogram of low-frequency 
DCT coefficients is also generated after 2D-DCT. Because 
low frequency component is more effective for recognition, 
we only use the coefficients on the left and above to extract 
features. This can also reduce computation time compared 
with using the whole DCT coefficients. In this paper, we use 
4x4 coefficient blocks as shown in Figure 3, the same 
domain as VQ histogram used at the upper left corner of the 
DCT coefficient block which retain the higher energy level 
of the image. The DC coefficient is not included in the 
features to reduce the influence of the lighting conditions of 
the images. Once the features have been selected, the energy 
histogram is created by using formula (5). 
These two histograms, which contain both phase and 
magnitude information of a DCT transformed facial image, 
are utilized as a very effective personal value. Recognition 
results with different type of histogram features are first 
obtained separately and then combined by weighted 
averaging.

 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. ORL database 
Face database of AT&T Laboratories Cambridge [25], 
[26] is used for recognition experiments.  In the database, 10 
facial images for each of 40 persons (totally 400 images) 
with variations in face angles, face sizes, facial expressions, 
and lighting conditions are included.  Each image has a 
resolution of 92x112.   Five images were selected from each 
person’s 10 images as probe images and remaining five 
images are registered as album images.  Recognition 
experiment is carried out for 252 (10C5) probe-album 
combinations by rotation method. The algorithm is 
programmed by ANSI C and run on PC (Pentium(R)D 
processor 840 3.2GHz). 
 
B. Results and discussions 
In our experiments, the bin size of energy histogram is set 
to 100. Figure 4 shows the comparison of the recognition 
results with different features. The average recognition rates 
obtained by each case with block size of 8x8 are shown here. 
Recognition success rates are shown as a function of filter 
size. Although recognition results only using energy 
histogram 
of 
low-frequency 
DCT 
coefficients 
(“N8_energy_hist”) are not satisfied, average recognition 
rate increases combined with VQ histogram of low-
frequency 
DCT 
coefficients 
(“N8_combined”). 
The 
maximum of the average rate 95.4% is achieved, which is 
1.7% higher than that only using VQ histogram in our 
previous work (“N8_VQ_hist”, the maximum of the average 
rate is 93.7%) [27].

features with the same weighting coefficient of two

histogram features. Recognition success rates are shown as a 
function of filter size.  “Max,” “Min” and “Ave” stand for 
the best case, worst case, and average results in 252 (10C5) 
probe-album combinations, respectively. The highest 
average recognition rate of 95.38% is obtained at the filter 
size of 3x3.  Low pass filter is effective for eliminating 
noise component and extracting important frequency 
component for recognition.   
By combining these two different features, namely 
phase information and magnitude information of low-
frequency DCT coefficient blocks, the most important 
information for face recognition can effectively be extracted.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
We have developed a very simple yet highly reliable face 
recognition method using features extracted from low-
frequency DCT domain, which is combined with VQ 
histogram and energy histogram. Excellent face recognition 
performance has been verified by using publicly available 
ORL database.  The effect of the image block size will be 
discussed in our future work, as well as the performance 
evaluation of the face recognition using larger face database.
