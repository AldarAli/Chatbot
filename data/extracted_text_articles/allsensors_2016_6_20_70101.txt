Abstract—This paper presents an arrangement based on a
customized computer and Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)
sensor system to allow the counting and recognition of the
colony formation, in an intelligent manner, of live bacteria.
Microbes in agricultural environments are important catalysts
of global carbon and nitrogen cycles, including the production
and consumption of greenhouse gases in soil. The magnitude of
this process is influenced by human activities and impacts the
warming
potential
of
Earth's
atmosphere.
The
method
implemented uses techniques of digital image processing, and
among them, Hough Transform for circular objects. For
calibration and validation of the method, a RGB (Red-Green-
Blue) camera based on the CCD was used, as well as a
prepared illuminated chamber, to allow the analysis of the
bacteria Escherichia Coli and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.
The visual environment, Borland Builder C++, was used for
the development, and a modeling for decision making was
incorporated to aggregate intelligence. Moreover, a set of
comparisons was established, taking into account the smart
methods and analyses carried out by experts. The results have
shown the potentiality of the method, which is applied for
laboratory applications that involve the quantification and the
pattern recognition of bacterial colonies in solid culture
environments.

INTRODUCTION
Some bacteria have properties that are beneficial to
plants. They can be found in the soil, and they have the
potentiality to affect, in a good way, the plants and cultures
by fighting against the harmful bacteria. Also, they can be
the source of providing nutrition to the crops. For instance,
bacteria increase the fertility of the soil and provide
nutrients, which are useful for plant growth. However, it is
still open for research to better understand the role bacteria
play when the plant grows. Although the cultivation of
microorganisms in solid culture is a traditional technique, it
continues being the compulsory step when it is necessary for
the isolation and purification bacterium lines. Nowadays, the
microbiology technique has been employed associated with
the traditional techniques, including counting and cultivation
in solid ways, when intending to quantify or isolate different
groups of microorganisms.
Many institutes, laboratories and entities are concerned
with establishing procedures, criteria and standards of
microbiology analysis involving the counting of colonies in
solid culture. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and
Food Supply, through the Normative Instruction nº 62, of
August, 26 of 2003, established a procedure to standardize
the counting of microorganism with application of samples
of raw material, water and meals [1]. The National Agency
of Health Surveillance (ANVISA) and the National Advice
of Environment [2] are examples of worried entities with the
criteria and standards of microbiology analyses.
There are different laboratory methods for counting
bacteria. Among them, one may consider the Counting
Chambers, which can fill in an automatic way a certain
volume and uses a special microscope slide with a cover
glass to calculate the number of bacteria per milliliter of the
original sample from the known volume:the Most Probable
Number, which estimates the number of bacteria; the
Membrane Filters, in which the water is filtered on a filter
which has holes smaller than bacteria and then is placed on a
dish of agar, and bacteria grow on the top of the filter to be
count; Photometers and Spectrometers, in which a meter
reads the amount of light passing through the culture, and by
consulting a standard curve which you have prepared by
reading the meter and plating the bacteria, you can estimate
the number of bacteria. These methods have the limitations
of counting live and dead bacteria [3]-[11]. On the other
hand, as a process of structural colony formation, which
excludes dead bacteria and debris an opportunity is observed
to have a method that uses a sensor for imaging and a
computer aided system for pattern recognition and counting
in an intelligent manner of the colony formation of live
bacteria.
However, it has been observed that the manual counting
of colonies is limited, because is a slow process and the
number of analyses performed depends of visual exposure
activity by the technician. Besides, in this context, the
development of a method based on the use of a sensor which
allows imaging for intelligent analysis of the colonies
formation of the bacteria and automatic counting of the
colonies formation units can speed up the number of
laboratorial analyses.
This paper presents a system for the recognition of
colonies formation of live bacteria and its counting. The
method uses the Hough Transform, adapted for the detection
of colonies with circular shapes, in order to aggregate the

intelligence for decision making in the agricultural industry.
After this introduction, Section 2 presents the theoretical
and technological background; Section 3 presents the method
of aggregation of computer intelligence. Finally, the results
and discussions are presented in Section 4, followed by the
conclusion in Section 5.
II.
THEORETICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A. Microbial growth phases
Most bacteria under optimal growing conditions grow
and divide every half hour [12]. Thus, the increase in the
population
numbers
from
a
single
bacterium
can
be
expressed as a geometric progression, as follows:
1 − 2ଵ − 2ଶ − 2ଷ − ⋯ − 2௡
(1)
where the exponent (0, 1, 2, 3, ⋯ ݊) refers to the number of
generations.
The
time
interval
required
for
each
microorganism to divide, or for the population of a culture to
double in number, is known as generation time [13]. It
should be noted that not every species of microorganisms
have the same generation time. Fig. 1 illustrates the bacterial
growth curve and its phases.
Figure 1.
The phases of the bacteria growth: A - lag phase;B - exponential
phase; C - stationary phase;D - declining phase (adapted from [12]).
There are four stages of growth that characterize the
bacterial
growth
curve:
lag
phase,
exponential
phase,
stationary phase and decline phase or cell death. Table I
helps the understanding of the phases of bacteria growth, i.e.,
Figure 1, where each phase represents the notion in relation
to its growing status.
TABLE I.
THE MICROBIAL GROWTH PHASES.
Lag phaseݐ଴≤ݐ<ݐଵ
Exponential phaseݐଵ ≤ݐ<ݐଶ
Stationary phaseݐଶ ≤ݐ<ݐଷ
Declining phaseݐ≥ݐଷ
The lag phase occurs after the inoculation medium. The
cells begin to adjust to the physical condition and available
nutrients. During this time, the cells are in a latency period
where there is an intense metabolic activity that is not
reflected in the increase in cell number. This phase can
continue for one hour to several days.
In the exponential phase, all cells are divided at regular
intervals of time, resulting in an exponential increase in the
number of individuals in the population. This phase is the
period of high metabolic activity of the cell; however, the
organisms
are
particularly
sensitive
to
environmental
changes.
The stationary phase occurs when the growth rate slows
down and strikes a balance between the rate of death and the
rate of divisions in the population.
Finally, the decline phase, or cell death, occurs when the
rate of death exceeds the rate of divisions. This phase
continues until the population disappears completely.
B. Manual Counting Method by Experts
The method based on manual analysis, employed in this
work for comparison purposes with the automated method,
uses a device which has a reticulated and illuminated acrylic
surface wherein the Petri dish is placed, and above the
surface, there is as increased magnifying 1.5 times with a
flexible rod that allows the experts to visually count the
existing bacteria colonies on the plate. For this research, the
experts used an apparatus named Colony Counter Phoenix
Luferco, model CP-608.
C. Sensor and Illumination System
A CCD camera is a semi-conductor device that acts as a
transducer between incoming light and electrical charge. For
the CCD sensor operation, it is important to consider the
level of the environmental illumination in relation to the
object one is going to work with. The lighting is an important
factor to be considered in forming the image, as it can
influence the final result of analysis, since the level of the
pixel intensity will be a function of the illumination and the
angle of its incidence over the object during the image
acquisition process.
In systems for the automatic counting of colonies,
generally, the main difficulty is the lighting system that
requires high power lamps to be dimmer; in some cases, the
use of special lenses or a combination of all these
components is necessary. There are at least two methods of
lighting that can be employed in an imaging system for
bacteria counting. One is the method that uses backlight, and
the second one is the method that uses front lighting. In the
first method, the Petri dish is placed on a light source under
the CCD camera. Generally, this method uses a white acrylic
plate between the light source and the plate to produce a
more uniform lighting. In the second, front lighting method,
the Petri dish is placed below both the light source and the
CCD
camera. The camera
captures
the light
of the
environment and performs the registration of the frames for
processing.
In order to get a better arrangement, for this research, a
front lighting system was developed for the acquisition of the
information from the bacterial colonies, which were located
into Petri dishes. For the lighting system four fluorescent
lamps of 20 watts connected by two electrical ballasts were
used. The use of electrical ballasts avoided the effect of the
flicker of the fluorescent lamps, which can be captured by
the CCD cameras, i.e., generated undesirable noise. The box
surrounding the set of bulbs was produced in wood. The box
that packages the lamps and the Petri dish has the following

internal measurements: 500 mm long by 250 mm wide and
500 mm in height. It has a front cover that allows the
manipulation of samples and a top cover that closes the box.
Internally there is a support for the lights and the camera
(Fig. 3). The CCD involves that photons striking a silicon
surface create free electrons through the photoelectric effect
[14][15]. Nature abhors a vacuum and, thus, a concomitant
positive charge (called as a hole) is generated, as well. If
nothing else is done, the hole and the electron will recombine
and release energy in the form of heat. This is accomplished
by positively biasing discrete areas to attract electrons
generated while the photons come onto the surface. The
substrate of a CCD is made of silicon, but this is not where
most of the action occurs. Photons coming from above the
gate strike the epitaxial layer and generate photoelectrons.
The gate is held at a positive charge in relation to the rest of
the device, which attracts the electrons to it. Because of the
insulating layer the electrons can't make it through to the gate
and are held in place by the positive charge above them.
Fig. 2 shows a basic diagram of a CCD and the
arrangement used for the serial image frame readout mode.
The image acquisition process starts when the incoming
photons reach the sensitive sensor array. To readout, the
sensor of the accumulated charge must then be shifted
vertically row by row into the serial output register. Besides,
for each row the readout register must be shifted horizontally
to allow for readout of each individual pixel.
Figure 2.
Block diagram of a CCD and its arrangement for the serial
frame readout mode.
The serial shift is performed from top to bottom and
directs the electron packets to the measurement electronics,
which involve an analog to digital (A/D) converter to allow
the measurement of the voltage created by the packet of
electrons at the serial output and turn this into an electronic
number that can then be digitally transmitted to and saved by
a computer.

including information about the place for the location of the Petri dish,
which is used for colonies bacteria growing.
In this schematic diagram, the following components of
the illumination system are displayed: a box, the top cover,
the front cover and built-in bracket for the lights and the
CCD camera. Moreover, the arrow indicates that the Petri
dish with the colonies is placed on the bottom center of box
under electrical ballasts.
D. Hough Transform
The Hough Transform (HT) has been proposed as a
method for detection of complex patterns in binary images
by Paul Hough in 1962 in the form of a patent [16]. One of
the goals Hough predicting was a method to recognize
complex patterns in pictures; another goal was to provide a
method and improved means for the recognition of particle
tracks in photographs taken in a bubble chamber. The Hough
Transform was first used in computer vision to detect
parametric curves [16][17] and, more recently, for the
widespread detecting of non-parametric forms [18][19].
In terms of circular objects, Duda and Hart (1972)
suggested the use of the Hough Transform adapted circles.
Whereas, the transform can be applied in the recognition
curves, provided
that the same
can be described
in
parametric form are a circle may be provided by a parametric
equation are that it is possible to adapt the Hough Transform
for circles.
The property first defined that a point in the cartesian
plane corresponds to a sine curve in the plane parameter.
Extending this property, you can adapt it for circumference.
In this case, a point on the cartesian plane corresponds to a
circle in plan parameters. Thus, taking all the pixels of the
cartesian plane and applying the circumference equation to
have each pixel generate a circumference in the parameter
space is represented by an accumulator array.
The parameter space is generated from the transformation
of the Cartesian plane through the circular Hough Transform,
where
image points correspond
to
circles
within
the
parameter and, therefore, the a and b coordinates are stored
in the accumulator array. The crossing of the circumferences

and the accumulated value in this cell defines how many
pixels belong to the circle. Besides, the use of the technique
known as backmapping provides means to reduce the false
peaks, which are usually found in the Hough Transform [20].
In this work, we used a three dimensional accumulator array,
in which a third dimension, representing the possible radii of
circumference, can be detected. In this way, the definition of
the new arrangement should be obtained by:

where ܽݎݎܽݕ(ܽ,ܾ,ݎ) is the accumulator arrangement filled

cos(ߠ),ܾ=ݕ− sin (ߠ), and ݂(ݔ,ݕ) is the gray level of a
pixel on the (ݔ,ݕ) coordinate whose value is in the range
from 0 to 255.
The dimensions of the accumulator arrangement should
be defined to avoid loss information, and it can be the same
height and width of image. However, if one pixel on the
image is near to the edge, the circle drawn exceed the limits
in the arrangement. Thus, to avoid loss of information the
dimensions of the accumulator array is defined by:
ܽݎݎܽݕ[ܺ௠௔௫ + 2 ∗ݎܽ݀݅ݑݏ][ܻ௠௔௫ + 2 ∗ݎܽ݀݅ݑݏ](3)
whereݎܽ݀݅ݑݏ means a value between interval [ܴ௠௜௡, ܴ௠௔௫],
ܻ௠௔௫ is the height and ܺ௠௔௫ is the width of the image.

THE AGGREGATION OF COMPUTER INTELLIGENCE
The aggregation of intelligence was based on the use of a
customized computer with 256MBytes of RAM, 1GHz
processors, and
a Windows© operational system. The
algorithm to aggregate the decision-support system was
developed using the object-oriented programming language
C++. Additionally, the tool platforms were based on the
Borland© C++ Builder. The flowchart of the algorithm is
illustrated in Fig. 4 and consists of five modules, namely as:
acquiring
information
module;
pre-processing
module;
processing module; post processing module; module for
analysis and decision making support.
The acquisition module includes a lighting system
developed in order to maintain uniformity in luminance to
obtain the process of capturing images suitable for analysis.
The capture is achieved by means of a CCD sensor for
higher pixel counts and miniaturization. The ICX452AQ,
having a diagonal 9.04 mm (Type 1/1.8) 5.13M pixel, was
used to respond to these needs, i.e., unit cell size equal to
2.775 μm (Horizontal) × 2.775 μm (Vertical) square pixels. 
The pre-processing module contains a set of techniques
to prepare the information collected from the bacteria for
processing and is responsible for preparing to organize in a
matrix to the stage of processing. This set includes a simple
global threshold [21], the threshold of Otsu [22][23],
conversion of color images (RGB) to shades of gray levels
and detection of edges using the Laplacian filter [24][25].
The processing module uses circular Hough Transform to
detect circular bacterial colonies from the pre-processed
image, containing the edges of possible bacterial colonies
with a circular primitive, and for each edge pixel, a
circumference is generated and stored in the accumulator
array.
Figure 4.
Flowchart of the algorithm which allows the aggregation of
intelligence to support decision makers.
The post-processing stage is responsible for preparing the
processed image for analysis and generation of results. The
technique of backmapping is applied to the circular Hough
Transform, i.e., in order to remove possible noise due to false
peaks generated during the processing process.
Fig. 5 shows the class diagram for the sensor reading and
computational vision and intelligence aggregation for the
recognition of the formation and colony count of live
bacteria.
The CHoughCircle generates and fills accumulator
array implemented by CMatrix class. The CSensor is
responsible for acquiring the image from the CCD sensor
and
preparing
it
for
analysis.

Furthermore, there is a stage for the analysis and decision
making support that allows for extracting the number of the
count and colony formation of live bacteria from the
processed image. Information can also be extracted and
stored in a collection for post-analysis of the growth of
bacterial species.
IV.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The illumination system allowed for regular illuminance
of 1200 lumen/m² over the image. Outside, the 750 lumen/m²
was the illuminance observed. Fig. 6 shows Petri dish
information acquired, i.e., having bacteria in both cases, that
means, inside and outside the illumination system and their
respective histograms. The value of illuminance does not
depend on the material properties of the surface being
illuminated. However, since the information depends on how
much is being reflected from other surfaces around it, it does
depend on the color and reflectance of the surfaces that
surround it.

Information acquired in 256 gray levels with additional illumination and

A set of twenty-six samples having bacteria was analyzed
and divided into two groups, i.e., Group #1 and Group #2.
For each group, computational and manual analysis was
performed by experts. The values of absolute error, relative
error and percentage error were calculated for each analyzed
sample. The Fig. 7 shows the sample #22 of the Group #1,
i.e., having Escherichia Coli samples.

Group #1. The white circles have show the processed information with the

and also the command for <Application of the Hough Transform> and
<Histogram>. Additionally, the number of reached colonies of
bacteria/sample is also shown in the interface).
The results obtained with the smart method for the
identification and colony count of the bacteria or even
microorganisms identified 460 colonies, while for this
exampled sample, the manual count realized by experts
identified 472 colonies. Table II presents the results for the
analysis carried out for Group #1, which had five samples of
the bacteria Escherichia coli in the solid culture.

For this Group #1, one may observe that the percentage
error was smaller than 10%, except for sample # 26, for
which the error rate exceeded such percentage. However, it
is possible to observe that the number of colonies per sample
was greater than 300 in most cases and, for the smart method
of counting, the errors remained small.
Fig. 8 shows the result of values dispersion, and the
linear correlation coefficient was equal to 0.98, i.e., when
plotting results obtained by measurements realized by
experts versus those obtained with the smart method.
This graph presented in Fig. 8 shows that the absolute
errors, which are associated with error-bars, are low in the
majority of the measurements. In the sample which the error
rate was greater than 10%, number of colonies were higher
than 600. In such cases, the manual analysis by experts is
usually performed by estimation of the occupied area on the

plate and not actually counted, and such situation may
explain these results.
Figure 8.
Correlation between the sensor-based recognition method and
the manual by experts for the Group #1,which represents the Escherichia
coli samples.
The contamination by Escherichia coli can be very
complex and involves all aspects of human and the
agricultural production, products and their interactions with
ecosystem. The epidemiology of each pathotype varies with
the reservoir host, levels of community sanitation and
hygiene, and agriculture and food production systems.
Prevention and control require a multidisciplinary approach
in which the transducers and sensors, as well as intelligent
systems and computer vision, plays an important role to
evaluate the risk-based approaches and to support decision
makers, i.e. involving from the producers up to the
consumers. Group #2 of samples referred to the cultivation
of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans on solid culture. Fig. 9
illustrates one of the results obtained with the intelligent
counting process. For this exampled sample, the manual
count by experts identified 82 colonies, while by the
automatic method, the result returned 84 colonies for such
sample.

From analysis of the Group #1, one may observe that the
absolute error remained smaller than 10%. However, there
are results which show a relative error rate above 10%,
particularly sample #3, sample #8, sample #15, and sample
#16. These results are linked to external factors inherent in
the process of sample preparation. Examples of external
factors of errors occur due to the provision of culture
medium on the Petri dish that can face problems related with
wrinkle or bubble, i.e., may find the growing of the colonies
near the edge of the plate. Fig. 10 shows the result of
dispersion of the values found in both the manual by experts
and the automatic counting for Group #1.

In the graph, the bars of errors are associated with the
absolute errors of each sample. The coefficient of linear
correlation found was equal to 0.99. For this group, the
number of colonies per sample was smaller than 200, and in
this case, the results obtained by automatic analysis were
very close to the manual one.
The Sulfur (S (symbol), Z (atomic number) = 16, ρ 
(density) = 2.07g/m³) deficiency in soils is becoming
common in many areas of the world, as a result of
agricultural practices. Therefore, the development of a smart
method to support decision making, especially in the
processes related to the identification and count of colonies
of microorganisms in soils, in particular those of the genus
Thiobacillus, is very much required.
V.
CONCLUSION
The method presented allowed intelligent recognition and
both the qualitative analysis and the quantitative count of the
bacteria colonies, i.e., using a customized computer and a
CCD sensor, as well as the Hough Transform for circular
microorganisms.
Groups of samples were analyzed to get the information
regarding to the bacterial colonies growing, its formation and
its number in the solid culture, all prepared in Petri dishes.
Results have shown high linear correlation, i.e., when
compared with the manual analysis executed by expert
people. In both cases, the linear correlation coefficients were
equal to 0.99, i.e., for the Escherichia coli samples (Group
#1), and for the Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans samples
(Group #2), respectively.
In the future, based on qualitative and quantitative
analysis on the bacteria and its colonies, additional methods
will be designed and that will have the possibility to be used
directly
in
the
agricultural
field
for
in-situ
analyses.
Additionally, this method will be able to be embedded and
ported to Android smartphones for online processing.
