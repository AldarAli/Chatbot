Abstract—In our daily life, people are often using forecasting
techniques to predict weather, stock, economy and even some
important Key Performance Indicator (KPI), and so forth.
Therefore,
forecasting
methods
have
recently
received
increasing attention. In the last years, many researchers used
fuzzy time series methods for forecasting because of their
capability of dealing with vague data. The followers enhanced
their study and proposed a stochastic hidden Markov model,
which considers two factors. However, in forecasting problems,
an event can be affected by many factors; if we consider more
factors for prediction, we usually can get better forecasting
results. In this paper, we present a multi-factor HMM-based
forecasting model, which is enhanced by a stochastic hidden
Markov model, and utilizes more factors to predict the future
trend of data and get better forecasting accuracy rate.
Keywords-fuzzy time series; forecasting; hidden Markov
model (HMM).
I.
INTRODUCTION
In the information explosion era, forecasting is a useful
methodology for enterprises or governments to predict future
trends. The more precise the forecasting result, the more
appropriate the behavior conducted by managers. In general,
many data are present with crisp value, but others are vague
and ambiguous instead, such as stock monitoring indicators,
signals, and so on. With the purpose of forecasting with
vague data, Song and Chissom [9] first proposed the fuzzy
time series and suggested seven steps for forecasting.
Therefore, numerous fuzzy time series forecasting models
have been proposed after them.
The seven steps proposed by Song and Chissom [9] are:
(1) define the universe of discourse; (2) partition the universe
into several intervals; (3) define fuzzy sets on the universe;
(4) fuzzify the historical data; (5) establish fuzzy relations;
(6) calculate the forecasted outputs; (7) defuzzification. The
literature used Alabama University enrollment data to carry
out one factor time relational, invariant fuzzy time series
forecast model. Sullivan and Woodall [4] improved the
results by using Markov’s matrix- based probability statistics
method [9] to establish one-factor one-order time invariant
forecast model.
The above introduced methods implemented one factor
to forecast, but in realistic circumstances, there is more than
one factor that affects the forecasted data, such as the
temperature and cloud density. Therefore, based on this idea,
Lee, Wang, Chen, and Leu [6] proposed a two-factor high-
order forecast model, which many people debate problematic
in deciding the high-order. Later, Li and Cheng [13]
proposed the deterministic fuzzy time series model that uses
the concept of state transition diagram to backtrack to the
most stable state. Wang and Chen [8] proposed two-factor
fuzzy time series model and used automatic clustering
techniques to partition intervals. Joshi and Kumar [1] first
extended the idea of fuzzy sets into Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets
(IFS) and used it to construction a method for determining
the membership degree.
Although fuzzy time series has been developed for
decades,
there
are
still
some
problems.
The
matrix
computing for two-factor fuzzy time series models are too
complex.
Furthermore, the process of fuzzy time series
forecasting is only concerned with whether or not the fuzzy
rule is adopted, while ignoring the importance of frequency.
Therefore, Sullivan and Woodall [4] used the Markov model
to improve the traditional fuzzy time series model. But
traditional HMM is unable to solve the two-factor problem.
If we can analyze more factors, we can get higher accuracy
and fully utilize all the available information. In our study,
we enhance the study of Li and Cheng [12] and expand the
model for forecasting based on multiple factors.
The fuzzy time series methods are good methodologies,
which are suited for data composed of linguistic values, but
the
fuzzy
relationship
ignores
the
importance of the
frequency. Hidden Markov models are powerful probability
models which use categorical data include linguistic labels,
and allow handling of two-factor forecasting problem. But in
real world situations, multiple factor data tends to appear,
rendering
this
model
ineffective
in
making
accurate
assessments.
In this study, we want to combine the benefit of both
methodologies, so that we can deal with the problem with
many factors and fully utilize the feature of fuzzy theory to
get higher accuracy result. There are five sections in this
study, which is organized as follows. In Section I, we
introduce the background and motivation. In Section Ⅱ, we
introduce the basic definition of fuzzy time series and hidden
Markov model. Section Ⅲ presents the model development.
We propose a fuzzy time series model to deal with the multi-
factor forecasting problem and we use HMM to build the
fuzzy relationship matrix.
In Section Ⅳ, we present the
experiment result. We demonstrate the proposed model step
by step and make a comparison with other existing methods.
In Section Ⅴ, we present the conclusions by discussing the
results as explained in Section Ⅳ and proposes future work
expecting to improve the proposed method.

LITERATURE REVIEW
A.
Fuzzy Time Series
Although there are many statistical methods that can be
used to solve the problem of time series, it is impossible to
resolve this problem when the historical data is linguistic
value. It was not until 1993, when Song and Chissom [9]
first proposed the fuzzy time series, that this problem has a
solution. Because of its easiness to use and comprehend,
there are many scholars who have dedicated their time and
energy to the field of fuzzy time series making it more
complete and accurate. The following is the basic definition
of fuzzy time series.

Definition 3：One-order Fuzzy Logic Relationship
In order to reduce the complexity of matrix computation,
Chen [11] proposed Fuzzy Logical Relationship (FLR)
combined with simple arithmetic operation to replace matrix
computation. If F(t-1)is transformed into linguistic variable
Ai, F(t)_is Aj, then the relationship between Ai and Aj can be
shown below:

The equation on the left side of the arrow is called the
Left Hand Side (LHS); the right side is called Right Hand
Side (RHS). After fuzzifying the historical data and
establishing the fuzzy logical relationship, then we can
group the entire data together to establish a logical
relationship group. The following shows the fuzzy logical

Forecasting Model of Fuzzy Time Series
Song and Chissom [9] first proposed a complete fuzzy
time series forecasting model and divided it into seven steps.
Later,
many
scholars
have
continuously
revised
this
framework in order to get better forecasting accuracy.
1)
Define Universe of Discourse U & Partition the
universe
Song and Chissom [9] defined the universe of discourse U
as follows:
[
]
min
1
max
2
,
U
D
D D
D
=
−
+
(6)
where Dmin and Dmax are the minimum and the maximum in
the training date set and D1 and D2 are the two proper
positive integers decided by the analyst. After defining U,
we partition the universe into several intervals. One is equal
length interval, and another is unequal length interval.
2)
Define Fuzzy Set and Linguistic Values
After fuzzyfying historical data we then begin to
decide linguistic values like rare, few, plenty and so on.
Each interval Ai (i=1,…,n) will have its own membership to
get linguistic value uk (k=1,…,n), which represents the
degree of belonging to each interval of each. They used their
own experience to formulate the membership degree of each
element in each fuzzy set; the example is shown in (7).

Fuzzify Historical Data
If the historical data is not ambiguous, we need to
fuzzify it first, for example hot, cold and linguistic values.
The process of fuzzification usually uses triangular fuzzy
sets. The triangular fuzzy set of equal length intervals are
represented in Figure 1, the unequal length intervals are
represented in Figure 2.

Linguistic values and triangular fuzzy set of equal length
intervals.

intervals.
4)
Establish Fuzzy Relation
Building up fuzzy relations is the most important part
in the fuzzy time series forecasting model. Among many
scholars, Song and Chissom proposed the time-variant and
time-invariant fuzzy relation matrix.
Let us introduce Song and Chissom’s method. First,
we need to observe the fuzzy relation
by historical data.
Second, find the relation matrix
which is composed of
.
By using following equation, we can get the relation matrix
, where
comes from first step and N means the total
number of fuzzy relations.
(8)
Finally, we can establish the forecasting model. There
are many models for forecasting models and the following
formula is one of composition to forecasting data, where
“o ”is max-min operator.
(9)
Then, we can get the forecasting result.
5)
Forecasting and Defuzzification
After establishing fuzzy relation matrix or fuzzy logical
relationship, we begin to forecast linguistic value and then
defuzzify it into precise one. However, there are some
scholars who replace the process of forecasting linguistic
value with a series of arithmetic operations, directly
restoring the value into precise. For example, Wong, Bai,
and Chu [14] proposed adaptive time-variant fuzzy time
series; they used dynamic analysis window combined with
series of heuristic rules to calculate the forecasting result.
The Proposed Defuzzification Method of Song and
Chissom is summarized as follows: First, we standardized
the calculated membership degree of linguistic value, and
then we followed the three criteria which are listed below to
defuzzify. (1) If there is only one maximum membership
degree, then, we use the corresponding midpoint of the
interval to be forecast value. (2) If the membership of an
output has two or more consecutive maximums, then select
the midpoint of the corresponding conjunct intervals as the
forecasted value. (3) Otherwise, standardize the fuzzy
output and use the midpoint of each interval to calculate the
centroid of fuzzy set as the forecast value.
C.
Markov Process
Markov
property,
named
after
the
Russian
mathematician Andrey Markov, refers to the memoryless
property of a stochastic process. A stochastic process has
the
Markov
property
if
the
conditional
probability
distribution of future states of the process (conditional on
both past and present values) depends only upon the present
state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
D.
Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Under realistic situation, there are usually multiple
factors that influence the behavior and outcome of an event.
For example, when we are trying to predict the temperature
today, we may want to know the density of cloud, the
amount of rainfall and also the weather yesterday. With the
observation today and some previous information, we can
predict today’s weather. We might obtain the better forecast
by combining the information of previous data and the
present observation. HMM [15] is exactly the tool that can
deal with two factors forecasting problem.
HMM is a statistical model to deal with symbols or
signal sequences that are assumed to be a Markov process
and have found a lot of applications in many areas like
speech processing, weather, economy, population growth,
stocks, etc.
The hidden Markov process is based on two important
and essential assumptions: (1) The next state is dependent
only upon the current state. (2) Each state-transition
probability does not vary in time, i.e., it is a time-invariant
model.
Figure 3.

The next three matrices of probability describe the
common calculations that we would like to be able to
perform on a HMM.

(3) Confusion matrix B
(11)
Therefore, we use
to present the overall HMM
model.
III.
MODEL DEVELOPMENT
There are many studies of fuzzy time series, but the
complexity of matrix computing still remains in multiple
factors forecasting. Even though we can use HMM method
to get the result faster and better, traditional HMM just can
solve two-factors problem only. If we can analyze more
factors, we can get higher accuracy and fully utilize all the
information we got.
In
this
study,
we
want
to
preprocess
data
with
fuzzification and use the transition of hidden Markov model
to forecast outcome.

A.
Fuzzify historical data of chosen variables
We follow the methodology of fuzzy time series
forecasting to fuzzify the historical data. In this study, we
conduct equal length interval method to partition universe of
discourse into n intervals.
First, we need to define the discourse universes of
historical data. Let
be the discourse
universes
of
hidden
state
and
observation
variables
respectively, and assume that the number of observation
variables is k.
In general, the discourse universes are defined as
follows:
where
are
the
respective minimal and maximal values of historical data of
hidden and observation variables, and
and
are proper positive values decided by the analyst.
Second, the discourse universes are then partitioned into
several equal lengthy intervals. Let us use
for
each interval. Therefore, we have fuzzy set
.
When a value approaches the center of linguistic value Ai, it
means the greater degree belongs to the linguistic value Ai,
thus, the membership degree is closer to 1; on the contrary,
if it is closer to the two bounds of Ai, the membership
degree which belongs to Ai will be closer to 0.
In traditional study, each value has two linguistic values
and corresponding membership degrees in most case, but
the past literatures ignored the smaller one. However, even
though our study is smaller, we think that it still has some
valuable
information.
Therefore,
we
use
triangle
membership function to fuzzify historical data, and the
fuzzy sets
are defined as seen in Figure 5:
Figure 5.
The fuzzy sets.
Finally, let us fuzzify the historical data and find the
degree of each data belongs to each
. Then,
we assume that if the maximum membership of that data is
under Ak , then we treat this data as Ak .
B.
Build HMM model
The
objective
of
a
multi-factor
hidden
Markov
forecasting model is to estimate the probability of hidden
state with given observations, so that we can predict the
sequence of state that best explains the observed data. The
following notations of HMM will be used in this paper:
20

Figure 6.
A Multi-factor Hidden Markov Model.
In our study, we expand the research to multiple
variables HMM and there are three important and essential
assumptions of our proposed model: (1) The next state is
dependent only upon the current state. (2) Each state-
transition probability does not vary in time, i.e., it is a time-
invariant model. (3) The observations are independent to
each other.
The first and second assumptions come from the
assumptions of HMM. The need for a third assumption is
because our proposed method deals with multiple factors; in
order to simplify the process, we ignore the impact of
correlation between observations.
Therefore, the multiple observations HMM can be
characterized by the following matrices:
is a vector with the probability of initial state. A is the
state-transaction matrix which provides information about
the relation of two contiguous hidden states.
is the
confusion matrix which is the relation between observation
v and hidden state.
Let us defined those parameters which are estimated by
relative frequencies:
First, the initial state
is a
matrix and is
defined as
(12)
where
is the number of initial state si in the
data set, and N1is the sum of initial state.
Second, the state transition matrix
is a
matrix and is defined as
(13)
Finally, the confusion matrix
is a
matrix represented as follows:
(14)
We construct an HMM model
and use this
model to forecast.
C.
Forecasting and defuzzificationwihwui
There are many alogrithms that can compuate the
probability of the observations and we can also estmate the
next state by getting maximal probability. Our study only
focuses on forecasting, so the proposed method just uses
dynamic programming to calculate maximum likelihood.
This study assumes that the variables of observation are
independent of each other. Based on the concept of
statistical
independence,
we
calculate
the
probability
directly to present the probability of observations.
(15)
Based
on
the
dynamic
programming
method,
we
construct the following equation:
(16)
According
to
the
notation
of
our
study,
, we then edit the model as
follows:

IMMM 2014 : The Fourth International Conference on Advances in Information Mining and Management

(17)
According to (18), we obtain the probability of hidden
state with given observations. Therefore, following the
sequence
of
maximal
probability,
we
can
reach
the
forecasting sequence of hidden state. However, the sequence
we estimated is fuzzy time series. Finally, we need to
defuzzy the outcome.
There are several defuzzificaton methods that can be
chosen. We use the most popular one, namely, centroid
method, which standardize the fuzzy output and use the
midpoint of each interval to calculate the centroid of fuzzy
set as the forecast value. This method is expressed as:
(18)
N：the amount of fuzzy set;
μA(xi)：the xi membership degree belonging to fuzzy se tμA;
Ci：the ith midpoint of interval corresponding to the ith
linguistic value.
IV.
EXPERIMENT RESULTS
The present section demonstrates the application of the
proposed
method
and
compared
the
accuracy
of
its
forecasted results with those results obtained by one factor
only. In order to evaluate the superiority of proposed model,
we use four evaluation indices to evaluate the performance,
such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), PMAD (Percent Mean
Absolute Deviation), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage
Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
In this experiment, we conduct the proposed model to
forecast
the
average
temperature
with
other
three
observations. With the forecasting results, the following
Figure 7 shows the respective performances of the Alishan
weather forecasting by implementing the proposed model.
This time series data are presented by month and
contains four main factors: (1) average temperature (2)
average humidity level (3) number of rainy days (4) total
sunshine duration. In this experiment, we conduct the
proposed model to forecast average temperature with three
other factors. In order to confirm the performance of the
proposed model, we also exhibit the forecasting result which
is
estimated
by
other
methods
we
have
mentioned
previously. The forecasting result is displayed in Figure 7.

The Forcasting result For Weather Data.
All the evaluation indices that are smaller will be
favorable. We can discover that the proposed model has
better prediction accuracy than most methods except Chen’s
newest model. Even though Chen’s model has better
prediction accuracy than the proposed one, the forecasting
results are quite similar between two models. In Chen’s
model,
high
order
information,
which
requires
more
computation, was considered. The proposed model uses four
factors one order to forecasting, and has the similar
performance with the model with one factor high orders. As
a result, we can realize the power of multiple factors.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTRUE WORK
The drawback of traditional forecasting models is that
they cannot forecast with multiple factor data and waste the
obtained information. However, this proposed model solves
the problem and demonstrates the indication that “predicting
with more factors can improve the forecasting result”.
There is a point can be focused in the future work. In
this model, we assume the relations between the observed
factors are independent. However some realistic data cannot
satisfy with this limitation. Therefore, we need to consider
the impact of coefficient between observed factors. But it
may make the model to be more complicated in calculation.
In the future, we may make our effort on adjusting the
model with consideration of coefficient more efficiently.
