Abstract— Requirements definition is an important work
process for a project and it may determine the success or
failure of system development project. If the requirements
definition is not adequate, ambiguous conclusions may be
drawn, which will lead directly to the failure of such a project.
Language is used as the general method of compiling the
requirements definition into drawings and documents, but a lot
of cases show that a word with many meanings makes the
requirements
definition
ambiguous.
To
optimize
the
requirements definition process, we present a model in which
the
trust
management
process
is
integrated
into
the
requirements definition process, in order to minimize the gap
between requirements caused due to a lack or discrepancy in
communication and to use a negotiation method for solving
problems of this kind. We discuss that building trust between
the stakeholders in the requirements definition process is
effective to optimize the requirements definition, which has
been produced by the special characteristics of Japanese firms
in the information system development, and we also describe
the necessity and effectiveness of the information system in
Japan. In conclusion, it can be said that trust management
using “trust” between the stakeholders to overcome the
difficulty of requirements definition is higher in Japanese firms
than in the U.S firms.
Keywords- requirements definition; establishment of mutual
trust;
social
uncertainty;

adaptive
processes;
special
characteristics of Japanese firms.

INTRODUCTION
A.
Background of Study
The role of the information system has increased in
importance, such that the information system is now
indispensable for companies to carry out work. Further, the
information system has been considered as not only a useful
product in companies, but also a significant infrastructure in
the whole society. As the social mechanism has grown more
sophisticated, the information system infrastructure has also
continued to become more complicated and the difficulty of
introducing it has increased steadily.
Kiritani
has
already
advocated
a
model
of
trust
management in the requirements definition that is a key
success factor in the information system construction and it
is optimized through the trust relationship between the
stakeholders [1].
In addition, the author believes that the
trust management is fully effective because the information
technology
development
environment
and
method
are
peculiar to the Japanese firms.
B.
Purpose of Study
The purpose of this study is to probe the following two
items
in
order
to
verify
the
effectiveness
of
trust
management in the requirements definition.

To clarify the difference in the requirements definition
between Japanese and U.S. firms when constructing
the information technology system.

To make sure that the trust management in the
requirements definition is necessary and effective due
to the special characteristics of the Japanese firms.
II.
DIFFICULTY OF EXECUTING REQUIREMENTS
DEFINITION IN JAPANESE FIRMS
A.
Actual Condition of Information System Construction
The information technology system construction (ITSC)
project that regards software creation as the main work is
difficult to meet the needs and demands of customers
through quality, cost and delivery. Approximately 70% of
all ITSC projects had a problem with the quality, cost or
delivery [1].
In addition, the survey results indicate that
approximately 18% of all constructed IT systems have not
actually been used, even after these projects were completed,
or other projects were interrupted before their completion
[2].
The reason ITSC is difficult to perform is considered to
be the characteristics of the IT system itself: “the system is a
complex aggregation of subsystems that have their own role
and function relationally one another” or “the needs of
customers in the IT system are always changing and a
request for change is often submitted in the middle of the
ITSC project” [3]. As the background of the ITSC project
that ends in failure, some researchers pointed out that “this
project is carried out with unclear customer needs”; “the
customer needs are not easily settled”; “the grounds for
estimation are ambiguous”; and “the system development
plan is carelessly made”. Other researchers also pointed out
31

ADAPTIVE 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Adaptive and Self-Adaptive Systems and Applications

that “the original documentation is insufficient” and “the
project management is not conducted” [4].
The requirements definition that belongs to the upper
process in the ITSC plays a role in compiling vague
requirements
from
stakeholders
into
drawings
and
documents including the designable content for system
installation from the viewpoint of technology, operation and
expense. In other words, the requirements definition is an
essential process to access the system development life cycle
(SDLC), which is related to the following processes (from
design process to operation/maintenance process) in the
ITSC, and to affect decisively the quality, cost and delivery
of the ITSC project. It seems that a request for change the
abovementioned is submitted because the requirements are
decided unclearly in the requirements definition and there is
a gap between such requirements and the ones actually
needed.
Many causes of project failure arise from the
method of executing the requirements definition and its
results. Especially, an occurrence of trouble caused by the
existence of tacit requirements and ambiguous consensus
building that are not expressed clearly leads directly to the
project failure under the limited man-hours and time for the
requirements definition process.
A lot of investigations and researches have reported the
relationship between the final success or failure of system
development project and the requirements definition. For
example, B. S. Blanchard [6] has reported that decision
making at an early stage in the system development life cycle
determines 70% to 80% of life cycle cost (LCC).
B. W. Boehm
[7]
has
verified
that
the
cost of
modification or alteration (rework) traced to the first project
management process increases as the project progresses on
the
basis
of
statistical
data
analysis
in
the
system
development project. K. E. Wiegers [5] has reported that the
“rework” cost of the constructed system occupies 30% to
50% of all system development cost and the rework cost
caused by errors in the requirements definition accounts for
70% to 85% of all the rework costs.
In addition, other
researchers have tried to explain the relationship between the
quality of findings from software requirements specifications
and the final success or failure of system development
project [8]. The requirements definition is an important work
process in the ITSC and the gap between requirements is
pointed out as the most important cause of failure in the
failed information system construction projects [9].
As a result, the quality of requirements definition leads
directly to the final success or failure of system development
project.
B.
Difficulty of executing requirements definition causing
ambiguity
It is evident that the requirements definition for the ITSC
is carried out through communication between human
beings, which accounts for a very large percentage of the
requirements definition [10][11]. The ITSC including many
distributed cooperative projects increases its difficulty level
especially due to communication problems [12].
Language is used as the general method of compiling the
requirements definition into drawings and documents, but, in
a lot of cases, a word with many meanings makes the
requirements definition ambiguous.
A study report has
pointed out that the effectiveness of communication using
language is low [4].
Even if the same word is used, its
meanings may be different between stakeholders because of
their own background and interests.
Since the information technology system is usually
equipped with massive functions, all functions of this system
to be constructed are generally defined.
However, it is
necessary to design even the parts or components with
undefined requirements to install them in the following
processes and also, these undefined requirements are treated
as tacit ones. The tacit requirements are often admitted in
accordance with each stakeholder’s “common sense”, which
brings a major cause of ambiguity of requirements definition
(a gap between requirements).
The
stakeholders
who
have
really
different
backgrounds socially and economically take part in the
requirements
definition.
Interests
exist
between
the
stakeholders, individual requirements of the stakeholders
intertwine with their acknowledgement and thoughts on the
project, and the requirements definition finishes without
enabling the stakeholders to put everything in common. In
this case, the stakeholders agree with one another in the style
of “scrambling for the pie”. Once trouble occurs, however,
the stakeholders consider excessively their interests and
requirements and negotiate ineffectively with one another for
a solution to the problem, so that it will cause a serious
problem that affects the quality, cost and delivery of the
ITSC project.
III. PRESENTATION OF HYPOTHESIS AND RESEARCH
QUESTIONS
A.
Hypothesis
Because the requirements definition process indicates a
lack of the necessary information on the partner’s intention,
it can be said that the social uncertainty exists here [14]. In
this condition, a trust relationship between the stakeholders
plays
a
role
as
lubricant
for
the
social
exchange
relationships [14].
Therefore, it is believed that an
improvement in the communication quality based on trust
can
minimize
the
gap
between
requirements
in
the
requirements definition process.
The development of trust relationships changes the
negotiation style between stakeholders from “scrambling for
the pie” to “solving a problem” [13], so that it seems that the
latter style improves the effectiveness of negotiation to
solve the problem that affects the quality, cost and delivery
of the ITSC project. The information technology system
construction
in
Japanese
firms
presents
unusual
environment and high complexity, when it is viewed from
the U.S. firms point of view. The main causes are the
difference
in
the
purpose
and
measures
of
system
construction between Japanese and U.S. firms, the old
business
custom and
the
characteristics
of a
nation.
Therefore, the development of trust relationships performs
validly to solve problems usually caused in the requirements
definition process especially in Japan.

We think that trust is important from an example of the
definition
of
requirements
to
adaptive
requirements
specifications of the information system development in
Japan and we made a model. Furthermore, we compared the
circumstances with the ones in the United States.
B.
Research Questions

To clarify the difference in the requirements
definition between Japanese and U.S. firms when
constructing the information technology system.

To make sure that the trust management in the
requirements definition is necessary and effective
due to the special characteristics of the Japanese
firms.
IV. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS STUDIES
A.
Study on Optimization of Requirements Definition
(Study on Trust Management in Requirements
Definition)
Kiritani designed, as a model of trust management in the
requirements definition, its improved model that the effective
optimization of the requirements definition can be expected
to enhance communication and negotiation that are the great
two factors in the requirements definition process through
the
development
of
trust
relationships
between
the
stakeholders [1].
1)
Communication
efficiency
is
improved
by
the
development of trust relationships,
minimizing the gap
between requirements
The
improvement
of
efficiency
and
accuracy
of
communication, which depends on the stakeholders, or
human beings, through the establishment of mutual trust
relationship minimizes the gap between requirements caused
by their knowledge and recognition. With the development
of trust relationships, an effect of reducing gap recognition
can
be
expected
for
emotional
requirements/needs
(especially dispensable requirements/needs).
2)
Realization of effective negotiation process with the
development of trust relationships
Because the ITSC is limited by the quality, cost and
delivery, it is difficult for the stakeholders to agree with one
another after all requirements that are defined in the
requirements definition process to remove completely the
gap recognition between the stakeholders.
A technique to
allow the effective negotiation process to be performed in
order to cope with the problem present in the following
processes is required by mutual agreement on the assumption
that there is the representative requirements gap including
the tacit requirements.
Figure 1 shows an effect on the basic model of
requirements definition when the mutual trust relationship is
established using the trust management.
B.
Previous Studies on Comparison of Information
Some information technology systems in the Japanese and
U.S. firms are explained in the following investigations and
studies: “Comparative Analysis of Japanese and U.S. Firms
on IT and Management” [15], “International Comparison of
IT Strategy and Company Performance between Japan, U.S.
and South Korea” [16], “Survey of IT Usage in Corporate
Management”
[17],
“Comparative
Analysis
of
IT
Management and Productivity between Japanese and U.S.
Firms” [18] and the report on the system development in
Japan compiled through interviews with persons having
technical
knowledge
about
the
situation
of
system
construction in both Japan and U.S. [19]. By reference to
these investigations and studies, we clarify the difference in
the IT system development between Japanese and U.S.
firms.
1)
Recognition of importance of IT investment and
purpose of IT investment
There is a significant deference in the attitude toward
“IT/information system investment” between Japanese and
U.S. firms.
While 75% of the U.S. firms consider this
Figure 1. Basic model of requirements definition improved by trust management

ADAPTIVE 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Adaptive and Self-Adaptive Systems and Applications

investment as “a matter of great importance”, only 16% of
the Japanese firms keep the same policy.
In terms of IT
expectation, the Japanese firms rank “optimization of work
using IT system and cost reduction (48.2%)” at the top of
their list of priorities, but the U.S. firms rank first
“strengthening
development
of
products
and
services
(41.0%)” and second “business model evolution” [15].
2)
Role of Chief Information Officer(CIO)
The U.S. firms “employing an expert IT manager” are
38%, i.e., the highest percentage. However, most of the IT
managers of the Japanese firms also hold the manager post
of a different department (38%). As to the CEO’s business
career in the Japanese firms, many IT managers come from
the in-house departments such as “corporate planning
department”,
“general affairs/finance departments” and
“information processing department” and are less than 30%
under the equality of opportunity. On the other hand, 35%
of the IT managers of the U.S. firms are scouted from
outside the company and are extremely higher than those of
the Japanese firms, which indicates that the U.S. firms
appoint remarkably many outside specialists [16].
3)
Software investment by type
The packaged software is less than 10% in Japan, but it
is approx. 30% in the U.S. Most of software investment in
Japan is made in order software. The feature of the Japanese
software industry is the multi-step system that a major
software
company
receives
a
large-scale
system
development order and divides it into small lots to place
orders with the software houses as subcontractors [17].
4)
Many Japanese firms dump everything on vendors
and many U.S. firms performing in-house production
A lot of the U.S. firms have not performed IT system
outsourcing activities by industrial field.
As to the whole
enterprise systems including the financial accounting, 58%
of
the
U.S.
firms
have
responded
“no
outsourcing
activities”, and as to the supply chain management (SCM)
and sales promotion support, 53% of them have not
requested outsourcing services.
Although there is little
difference in the ordering process between the Japanese
firms, many of them have used outsourcing services.
Approx. 40% of the Japanese firms usually “make an
order
after
exchanging
contracts
through
previous
negotiations between the outsourcing companies and their
own companies” in all cases of “the whole enterprise
systems including the financial accounting”, “the systems
by business department” and “the existing systems update”,
which explains a characteristic of the Japanese firms that
carry
out
previous
negotiations
with
the
outsourcing
companies. A lot of Japanese firms have responded that the
IT system outsourcing companies are “needed to reduce
costs”.
On the contrary, a few U.S. firms require the IT
system outsourcing companies in order to reduce costs, but
many U.S. firms expect these outsourcing companies to fill
the role of a “technical adviser” [16].
C.
Difference in Information System Development Method
between Japanese and U.S. Firms
The difference in information system development method
between Japanese and U.S.firms, including the study on the
system development in Japan compiled through interviews

with persons having technical knowledge about the situation
of system construction in both Japan and U.S. [19], is
described below by reference to the previous studies on
information technology system and the survey results. See
Table 1. Difference in IT system development method
between Japanese and U.S. firms.
V.
ASSESSMENT OF TRUST ITEMS IN REQUIREMENTS
DEFINITION
A.
Difference in Stakeholder Composition in Requirements
Definition
According
to
the
following
information
system
development and management model diagram, the features
of stakeholders in information system construction are as
follows:

In Japanese firms, the information system development
and management model are constructed complicatedly
and the interests of the stakeholders are intricately
intertwined.

In the U.S. firms, the information system development
and management model shows that the interests of the
stakeholders are basically matched.
B.
Difference in System Development Method due to
Recognition of Unclear Requirements Definition
A lot of the Japanese firms manufacture the system to
automate the completely preset business process for the
purpose of systematization. However, the U.S. firms tend to
create a new proper business process and manufacture the
system to support it.
Therefore, there is a difference in recognition of unclear
requirements definition between Japanese and U.S. firms.
As a result, it seems that the Japanese firms often adopt the
waterfall software development method that regression is not
supposed, but the U.S. firms select the agile software
development method that the improvement of software is
postulated
to
repeat
even
after
operation
with
the
requirements not settled in the requirements definition
process.
Because the outside system integrator as a consignee
manufactures the system in Japan, this company may deliver
the system at completion and aims to make a more perfect
system, which affects the selection of software development
method.
VI. DIFFERENCE IN INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
CONDITION BETWEEN JAPANESE AND U.S. FIRMS AND
DISCUSSION OF TRUST MANAGEMENT IN REQUIREMENTS
DEFINITION
A.
Difference in Requirements Definition Process between
Japanese and U.S. Firms
1)
Information
system
development
project
in
the
Japanese
firms
showing
the
situation
that
“social
uncertainty exists”
The information system development and management
model in the Japanese firms indicates that the interests of
the stakeholders are more intricately intertwined than that in
the U.S. firms. This is because “the requirements definition
needs information on the partner’s intention, but is lacking in
such information”; “it shows that the stakeholders have
interests one another and social uncertainty escalates”; and
“the partner’s self-interest behavior makes you have a bad
time”.
In other words, it can be said that the social
uncertainty exists.
2)
Information system development in the Japanese
firms using the precondition
and method of keeping
consistent requirements
The
Japanese
firms
select
the
information
system
development method to keep more consistent requirements
as a precondition than the U.S. firms.
As a result, the
inconsistent requirements greatly affect the quality, cost and
delivery. For this reason, it is necessary to optimize more
the requirements definition process.
It means that the
measures used to optimize the requirements definition, such
as the trust management, are extremely needed.

3)
High
quality
required
for
the
completion
of
information system in the Japanese firms
Since a lot of the Japanese firms order collectively the
information system to an outside system integrator, the
completion of information system leads to its delivery.
Thus, a high quality level is needed for the information
system. It can be also said that high accuracy is required for
the requirements that are connected directly to the quality of
information system.
B.
Special Characteristics of Japanese Firms in
Requirements Definition and Assessment of Trust
Management
1)
Special characteristics of the Japanese firms in
comparison with the U.S. firms
The information system development and management
model, including the requirements definition, in the Japanese
firms can be extremely difficult because of the following:

In
the
Japanese
firms,
the
interests
of
the
stakeholders
are
intricately
intertwined
in
the
requirements definition process, and it is more difficult
to collect opinions and agree in the Japanese firms than
the U.S. firms.

The waterfall method that many Japanese firms use
cannot remove an effect in the quality, cost and
delivery caused by the change of requirements in the
following processes. Like this, it is indispensable for
determining the requirements in the requirements
definition process, and it is more difficult to do so in
the Japanese firms than the U.S. firms.
2)
Special characteristics of the Japanese firms and
necessity of trust management
In order to optimize the requirements definition process
in the Japanese firms while taking into account their special
characteristics
in
the
requirements
definition,
trust
management may be needed to optimize the requirements
definition by increasing trust between the stakeholders.
VII. CONCLUSION
The interests of many stakeholders for the IT system
construction in the Japanese firms are intricately intertwined,
so that it can be clearly said that the IT system development
project indicates “the situation that social uncertainty exists”.
The quality of information system is highly expected to
improve in the Japanese firms and most of them use the
construction method (Waterfall) with the precondition of
keeping the consistent requirements, which causes finally
troubles due to unclear customer needs.
On the other hand, the number of stakeholders in the U.S.
firms is limited and a few conflicts of interests are
considered between them. In other words, it can be said that
“the social uncertainty does not exist”. As to the expectation
of IT system quality to be improved, most of the U.S. firms
use the construction method (Agile) with the precondition of
keeping the inconsistent requirements and they can cope
flexibly with the change of requirements.
In conclusion, it can be said that the trust management
using “trust” between the stakeholders to overcome the
difficulty of requirements definition is higher in the Japanese
firms than in the U.S. firms;it is more effective and necessary
to optimize the requirements definition in the information
system development of Japan where a great effect is made by
the change of requirements and the social uncertainty exists
in the information system construction project.
