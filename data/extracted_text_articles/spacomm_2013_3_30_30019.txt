Abstract—The 
signal 
generator 
with 
Direct 
Digital 
Synthesizer Phase Locked Loop (DDS-PLL) Hybrid structure 
generates the signal with the qualities of the wide bandwidth 
and high frequency resolution. The long acquisition time in 
the PLL limits its applications. A novel generator structure is 
proposed by adding the sweeping voltage circuitry to the 
classical DDS-PLL Hybrid in order to accelerate the 
acquisition speed. A test circuitry is designed to testify the 
novel structure. The measured results indicate that the 
acquisition time is reduced to be 2.175μs and 1.032μs 
corresponding 
to 1MHz and 
2MHz 
loop 
bandwidth 
respectively; the pulse compression result is very good where 
the main lobe width remains as ideal, Peak Side Lobe Ratio 
(PSLR) is better than -38dB, and the Integrated Side Lobe 
Ratio (ISLR) is better than -9.5dB.

I. INTRODUCTION 
With the developments of radar application, the 
requirements of fast frequency hopping increase. It has 
considerable benefits to improve the radar performances 
and reduce the difficulties in signal processing if the signal 
has large bandwidth, good frequency linearity and low 
harmonics [1]. 
Generally, a signal can be generated in three ways: 
Phase Locked Loop (PLL) [2], Direct Digital Frequency 
Synthesizer (DDFS) [3] and Direct Digital Waveform 
Synthesizer (DDWS) [4]. DDFS is named DDS for short 
usually. The PLL technique operates from audio 
frequencies up to millimeter waves and the bandwidth is 
large, it also has some drawbacks: poor linearity in the 
frequency modulation rate, long acquisition time, and large 
phase error. The DDS and DDWS both operate in digital 
way. Although they has the advantages of fine resolution, 
fast switching and continuous phase, the disadvantages of 
serious spur and harmonics and small bandwidth are 
obvious. For the most advanced commercial DDS circuit, 
the bandwidth is less than 1.4GHz, the phase noise is better 
than -128dBc/Hz, and the frequency resolution is 190pHz 
[5]. The system speed limitation causes the bandwidth of 
the signal generated by the DDWS to be relatively narrow, 
only 400MHz most [6]. 
In the DDS-PLL Hybrid structure, the DDS generates 
the narrow-band Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal with 
low intermediate frequency. The PLL up converts the IF to 
the required RF signal and expands the bandwidth. This 
structure has the benefits both from the DDS and PLL. 
The acquisition time is the most serious problem in the 
DDS-PLL Hybrid structure. In the paper, we propose a 
novel structure by adding a sweeping voltage circuitry to 
the classical DDS-PLL Hybrid structure. It brings in the 
benefits of shortening the acquisition time. Meanwhile, the 
predistortion is employed to depress the static phase error 
and improve the pulse compression qualities. 
The remaining sections of this paper are arranged as 
follows. Section II analyzes the acquisition process. The 
novel structure is introduced in section III. Section IV lists 
the measurements to the signals generated by the test 
system in the fields of acquisition time and pulse 
compression. This conclusion and future work are in 
Section V. 
II. ACQUISITION ANALYSIS 
The classical DDS-PLL Hybrid structure is depicted in 
Figure 1. In the structure, the BPF is band-pass filter, the 
PD is Phase Detector, and the LF is low-pass filter. The 
DDS generates the signal, used as the PLL reference, with 
the frequency 
cf . The frequency of the system clock is 
rf . 
The PLL outputs the signal with the frequency 
0f . The 
inherent filter in the PLL depresses the harmonics in the 
DDS output. The PLL multiplies the reference frequency 
by N to get the signal with the high radio frequency and 
large bandwidth [7][8][9].

The process of bringing a loop into lock is called 
acquisition. 
In 
Charge-Pump 
Phase-Locked 
Loops 
(CPPLL), the process of acquisition is divided to two parts, 
frequency pull-in process and phase acquisition process. 
Pull-in tends to be slow and often unreliable. When the 
signal was applied, a beat note at frequency 

 appears. 
The frequency pull-in process initiates and the beat note 
decreases. After the frequency pull-in process, the beat note 
reaches the pull-in limitation, and phase acquisition process 
starts. The time from unlocked state to locked state is 
named acquisition time. It is also divided into be frequency 
pull-in time and phase acquisition time. In theory, they are 
defined as follows for a 2nd order type 2 PLL, respectively

example, when the phase detecting frequency is 20MHz, 
the loop damping ratio is 0.707, and the natural frequency 
is 500 kHz, then the frequency pull-in time and phase 
acquisition time are 2.48μs and 2.25μs respectively. In 
general, the phase acquisition process is faster than the 
frequency pull-in process. 
III. FAST ACQUISITION 
There are some drawbacks in the classical hybrid 
structure namely large phase error in the steady state and 
long acquisition time. We propose a novel structure by 
adding sweeping voltage controlling circuitry to the 
classical structure. The novel structure is shown in Figure

From (3), we know that the sweeping voltage is a linear 
function of time. A short pull-in time can be achieved since 
the output frequency is directly set by the controlling 
voltage 
c
V , therefore, the beat note between the divided 
output and reference input is smaller than the pull-in 
limitation 
p
. The sweeping voltage takes the role of 
frequency setting. The phase acquisition is accomplished 
by the PLL. The ideal sweeping voltage curve is shown in 
Figure 3(a) where the sweeping voltage increases from 
1.6V to 9.1V in 100μs as a straight line, and decreases to 
1.6V abruptly at the end of the signal pulse. The fine-tuned 
voltage output by PFD is shown in Figure 3 (b) where the 
fine-tuned voltage varies fast in a small range of 
-0.1V~0.1V. Obviously, two oscillations occur in Figure 3 
(b). The first one is the tracking process of the Linearity 
Frequency Modulation (LFM) signal from 0μs to 100μs. 
The second one is the process of tracking the falling 
frequency corresponding to the voltage falling at 100μs in 
Figure 3 (a). Although the instantaneous frequency 
migration is very large, thanks to the sweeping voltage 
which sets the output frequency of VCO primarily, the 
fine-tuned voltage converges to zero smoothly.

Figure 3. Simulated transient settling behavior 
However, the actual voltage–frequency characteristic is 
nonlinear in practice. For instance, the VCO characteristic 
curve of ROS-2800-719+ is shown in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Characteristic of VCO 
The dashed curve shows the ideal characteristic. The 
solid line figures out the actual VCO voltage–frequency 
characteristic. It approximates to a straight line in the range 
of 1V to 25V. The nonlinearity is serious when the voltage 
beyond 25V. We must note that the range with good 
linearity should be used when generating signals with the 
device ROS-2800-719+. 
To sweep with the actual voltage characteristic we need 
to sample the actual controlling voltage and store them in 
the memory. The actual sweeping voltage is generated by 
DAC with the sample data. Synchronization of the 
sweeping voltage and the reference is most important. For 
this reason, the controlling signal SYNC is introduced as 
shown in Figure 2. 
In the novel structure, the sweeping voltage takes the 
original beat note between the down-scaled frequency and 
the reference frequency into the pull-in limitation 
p
. The 
frequency pull-in time is reduced to be sufficient small that 
we can neglect it as compared to the phase acquisition time. 
So there is phase acquisition time only. The acquisition 
speed is increased substantially. 
The loop filter and summer are shown in Figure 5. The 
in-phase follower and RC devices in the dash frame 
compose the active loop filter. The PLL is 3rd order type 2. 
Different from the ideal 2nd order type 2 PLL, there is an

adding high frequency pole. The influence to the transient 
induced by the additional pole is small. The PLL 
approximates an ideal 2nd order type 2. The current 
pI  
output by the PFD is imported into inverter phase adder 
across the in-phase follower with the sweeping voltage 
across the RC filter. The summer outputs the final control

IV. MEASUREMENT 
We test the novel structure with four modules on hand. 
They are the DDS module, the DAC module, the filter and 
summer module, the PFD and VCO module. The 
connections and the actual circuit are shown in Figure 6. 
 
The DDS module: The DDS we used is AD9910 
with 1GSPS internal clock speed and up to 400 
MHz analog outputs. There is an integrated RAM 
which can be used as the storage of the phase 
predistortion data; 
 
The DAC module: The DAC5675 gets 14-bits data 
widths, up to 400MSPS updating speed. When the 
SYNC comes, voltage sample data is read out from 
the storage, and delivered to DAC to generate the 
sweeping voltage; 
 
The filter and summer module: This module 
contains an active filter and an inverse summer. The 
circuit is as in Figure 6. The amplifiers in the filter 
and summer are OP1177 and AD823 respectively; 
 
The PFD and VCO module: The PFD is ADF4113 
with the features of 0.2GHz ~4.0GHz RF input 
frequency, 200MHz phase detect frequency, and 
max 5mA current output. VCO is ROS-2800-719+ 
with 1.4GHz~2.8GHz output. 
By changing the RC values in the loop filter, we build 
PLLs with 1MHz and 2MHz loop bandwidth respectively. 
The signal is generated with 600MHz bandwidth, 100μs 
pulse width, and 6MHz/μs FM rate. And the output signal 
is in the range of 1350MHz~1950MHz, the frequency 
resolution is 5.82Hz. We record the waveform by the 
oscillograph of DPO71254 with 6.25GHz sample rate. 
The measurement of the acquisition time is difficult 
because the lock-in point is not easy to be determined. In 
this paper, we fix the lock-in point with the phase error. If 
the phase error falls into the range of ±10°, starts to 
oscillate in a small range, and diminishes, we define the 
loop is locked in. Based on this assumption, the phase 
errors of the loop with 1MHz and 2MHz bandwidth are 
drawn in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The red one is the phase 
error of the waveform, and the black one is the high-order 
polynomial curve. We zoom in on the starting part in Figure 
7 (a) and Figure 8 (a) and show in Figure 7 (b) and Figure 8 
(b).

Figure 9. Compression result 
In the figures, the phase error is very large at the 
beginning, and then diminishes quickly. We find the 
lock-in point and mark it in Figure 7 (b) and Figure 8 (b). 
The acquisition times can be read out from the figures: 
2.175μs and 1.032μs for the two loops of different 
bandwidth respectively. We calculate the acquisition time 
for the classical structure using ADIsimPLL. The phase 
acquisition time and frequency pull-in time are 3.43μs 
and 2.32μs for the loop of 1MHz bandwidth. And they 
are 2.175μs and 1.032μs for the loop of 2MHz bandwidth. 
Obviously, the total acquisition time is decreased to 
approach phase acquisition time. The novel structure 
proposed in this paper is effective to reduce the frequency 
pull-in time. 
The pulse compression with Hamming weight is 
shown in Figure 9. The red curve is the pulse 
compression with ideal signal; the blue curve is the pulse 
compression with the actual signal. It has perfect

performance. The main-lobe width of the actual signal is 
the same as the ideal one, the PLSR is better than -38dB, 
and the ISLR is -9.5dB towards -9.9dB for the ideal. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A structure of fast locking signal generator is 
proposed in this paper, with adding sweeping voltage 
circuitry to the classic DDS-PLL Hybrid. Great decrease 
of the frequency pull-in time is achieved because the PLL 
is brought in the pull-in range by the sweeping voltage. 
To validate the structure, a test system is built to generate 
a LFM signal with 600MHz bandwidth, 100μs pulse 
width and 6MHz/μs FM rate. The acquisition time is 
reduced to be 2.175μs and 1.032μs with 1MHz and 
2MHz loop bandwidth respectively. Based on this novel 
structure, signals with wider bandwidth and longer 
duration are expected to be generated to improve the 
qualities of radar.
