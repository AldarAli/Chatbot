Abstract—Cloud Computing is a prominent field of research
with several areas of knowledge to be explored. The current
state of the art of cloud computing regarding capacity planning
is a more specific field to address in research and further
studies. This work has the objective of identifying, evaluating
and interpreting published research that examines sizing and
capacity planning for cloud computing workloads. To achieve
that, a systematic literature review was conducted. This review
resulted in the finding of 504 works, of which 52 were
identified as primary studies. The studies were then classified
according to research focus and aspect of cloud capacity
planning. The work investigates what is known about capacity
planning models for cloud computing workloads. The results
show statistical data about cloud capacity planning, gaps in
current research and models for sizing cloud computing
workloads with no historical use and workloads based on
functional characteristics or architecture.
Keywords - cloud capacity planning; capacity planning;
cloud computing.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Cloud Computing is a way of referring to the use of
shared computing resources [1]⁠. Cloud Computing groups 
gather a large number of servers and other computing
resources and generally offer combined capacity based on
payment on demand and by cycle [2]⁠. Conceptually, Cloud 
Computing deals equally with partial or complete abstraction
of
computational
capacity,
delivering
infrastructure
components in the form of service to the end customer [3]⁠. 
Cloud Computing brought us a new paradigm after the
evolution of the use of mainframes for x86 servers [4]⁠. In 
this model, users no longer have control over the physical
technology infrastructure [5]⁠. Cloud computing describes a 
new approach for how computing services and components
are available to users.
One of the key aspects to define and implement a cloud
computing workload is to understand the appropriate amount
of resources needed to meet demand. Mainly, this activity is
conducted by applying empirical approaches [6]⁠. On the 
other hand, “empirical methods” generally imply that the
workloads use some sort of historical data to address the
sizing – which is not always possible, especially in
innovative systems. Another aspect is that to define the
amount of resources needed by a specific workload, it is
important to understand its architecture, since, even though
historical data may be available, it is not effective to assume
that this workload has appropriate enhancements in terms of
the amount of resources needed to meet the demand.
To understand how those gaps are usually managed, a
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to map
out how to address those issues and processes with regards to
capacity planning of cloud computing workloads.
This work is structured as follows: Section I presents the
introduction of Capacity Planning of Cloud Computing
Workloads; in Section II, related works are presented; in
Section III, a brief introduction to cloud capacity planning is
addressed; in Section IV, the applied protocol of this
systematic review is presented; in Section V, all results are
presented; in Section VI, all findings are addressed and
discussed; finally, in Section VII, conclusions are presented.
II.
RELATED WORK
Considering that Cloud Computing is a relatively new
research field, especially in the case of Capacity Planning,
there was no related work found regarding Systematic
Literature Reviews on this subject. Even so, the different
aspects addressed in this research can be found individually
in the primary studies found as a result of this Systematic
Literature Review (SLR).
In regards of capacity planning models for cloud
computing workloads, most of current approaches somehow
apply historical use data as key source of information to
establish workload resource needs [6]⁠. Although this 
assertion can be confirmed as presented on the results of this
research, there was no research found in the systematic
review addressing cloud capacity planning. When evaluating
the results of this study, when relating systematic reviews
and cloud computing, the only topic addressed in the
research found was Cloud Migration [1]. So, is possible to
assume that capacity planning of cloud computing workloads
is a subject that has unanswered questions that are relevant to
be studied.

CLOUD CAPACITY PLANNING
Restrictions regarding software development projects,
especially considering shortened schedule horizons and
contracted time-to-market deadlines, manifest in traditional
approaches to capacity planning, where often a gap is seen
and is a major risk compromising their production plans [6]⁠.
A formal Capacity Planning approach facilitates forecasting

of sizing requirements based on the opportunistic use of
whatever
performance
data
and
tools
are
available
[1][6][54]-[56]. One of the key aspects when analyzing the
relevance of capacity planning in cloud computing projects is
the amount of resources needed to meet demand. Depending
on the stage at which a project based on cloud computing is,
it
may
be
economically
unfeasible.
This
is
because
architectural decisions can directly impact the need for
resources and consequently make the project unviable [4]⁠. 
Thus in scenarios where there are resource limitations, it is
essential to establish a formal capacity planning model [7]⁠. 
IV.
APPLIED PROTOCOL
For the development of this study, general approaches for
performing systematic reviews in software engineering [8]⁠ 
and also for its analysis [9]⁠ were applied. Our review process 
has six steps: (1) establish research protocol, (2) inclusion
and exclusion criteria definition, (3) perform search (4)
content assessment, (5) data extraction, and (6) synthesis.
The objective of this review is to identify current
approaches in scientific literature on sizing and capacity
planning for cloud computing workloads. The following
questions help identify primary studies:

What are the capacity planning models for cloud
computing
workloads
available
in
scientific
literature?

Do capacity planning models consider workloads
with no historical use?

Are there capacity planning models for cloud
computing
workloads
based
on
functional
characteristics or its architecture?
A. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
For this systematic review, we considered studies that
focus in analyzing cloud capacity planning models. The
studies could refer to cloud capacity planning specifically or
have a broader scope, taking in consideration both cloud
computing and capacity planning individually. Considering
that this field of research is recent but also in constant
development, this review examined studies published from
the year 2017.
We also excluded:

Studies not published in the English language;

Studies that were unavailable online.
B. Search Strategies
The databases considered in the study are in the list
below:

ACM Digital Library;

IEEE Xplore;

ScienceDirect – Elsevier.
To ensure that relevant studies would not be excluded
when querying different scientific databases, the search
strings were tested on each one of databases to guarantee that
it would work for all of them. As a result, a general search
string was defined:
1.
“cloud capacity planning” OR;
2.
“capacity planning” AND “cloud computing” OR;
3.
“capacity planning” AND “cloud”.
As mentioned before, the due process of database search
and search strings were tested individually on each database
until a final statement was defined. The searches were
performed between March 2020 and April 2020. The results
of each search were summarized and later examined in order
to identify duplicity among them. Table 1 presents the
number of studies found on each database.

C. Studies Selection Process
The papers that were collected in the search process were
gathered and added to the Mendeley [61] tool. It was found
that there were 9 duplicated works among all databases,
resulting in a total of 504 non-duplicated papers. Then, they
all had their titles analyzed to determine their relevance and
adherence to this study. At this stage, the works that did not
have a relationship to capacity planning of cloud computing
workloads were eliminated. Papers where the titles were
unclear about their relation with the subject of this study
were put aside to be analyzed in the next step. At the end of
this stage, 365 works were excluded and remaining were 137
items for further analysis of abstracts.
At this stage, all works found previously had their
abstracts analyzed. Many were also eliminated due to not
conforming to the scope of capacity planning of cloud
computing workloads. Papers where it was difficult to
determine if they conform to the scope of this study due to
the aforementioned reasons were included to be filtered out
at a further step. As result of this phase of analysis, 75 papers
were excluded, thus remaining were 62 to be analyzed more
closely. Table 2 presents the number of studies filtered in
each step of selection process.

D. Quality Assessment
After analyzing the search results that did not conform to
the scope of this review, we moved on to the quality
assessment stage. In this stage, all 62 studies were analyzed,
and not only titles or abstracts. In the quality assessment,
relevance criteria were established to analyze several aspects
regarding each paper selected on prior stages.
To assess the quality of publications, eight questions
were defined, based on [9]⁠, to support in quality assessment 
62

process. Questions supported the analysis, ensuring that
relevance and credibility of all papers were being considered.
Of the eight questions raised, the first and last one were used
to establish whether the paper was relevant for this review. In
this case, both questions were used as final exclusion criteria.
The other six questions were useful to determine the quality
of papers regarding research methods and other related
aspects. In this case, those grades supported a formal quality
analysis of publications. The questions were:
1.
Does the study examine capacity planning models
for cloud computing workloads?
2.
Is the study based on formal research methods - not
just empirical applications?
3.
Are the objectives of the study clearly defined?
4.
Is the study context adequately described?
5.
Were the methods for data collection used and
described correctly?
6.
Was the research project adequate to achieve the
research objectives?
7.
Have the research results been properly validated?
8.
Does the study directly contribute to this research?
Of the 62 select studies in prior stages, 52 passed to the
stage of synthesis and were thus considered primary studies.
In the results section, quality assessment process will be
described in detail along with the assessment of the 52
remaining studies.
V.
RESULTS
As presented previously, 52 studies were identified [9] –
[60] as primary studies. In general, all of them address
aspects of this systematic review, whether in terms of scope
or research questions.
A. Quantitative Analysis
The research process conducted resulted in 52 primary
studies. They were written by 185 authors affiliated to
institutions from 19 different countries and were published
between 2017 and 2020. A total of 82 different keywords
were identified in all papers.
Regarding country of origin, most of the publications
were from United States and India (both with eight
publications, each, comprising 15% of all primary studies),
followed by Brazil (six publications, comprising 12% of all
primary studies). United Kingdom had four publications,
Australia,
China,
Finland,
Iran
and
Italy,
had
three
publications, followed by Spain with two publications.
Germany,
Chile,
France,
Macedonia,
Malaysia,
Qatar,
Sweden, Taiwan, and Ukraine each had one publication.
Considering the various different origins, it can be concluded
that capacity planning of cloud computing workloads is a
globally widespread topic.
The most common keywords used in selected works,
with their respective frequency were: cloud computing (13),
capacity planning (8), performance model (5), resource
management (5), prediction (4), application (3), performance
(3), simulation (3), workload (3), auto-scaling (2), big data
(2), quality of service (2), resource provisioning (2), web
application (2), workload characterization (2). The first two
keywords - cloud computing and capacity planning - reflect
exactly the subject of this research.
B. Quality Analysis
As presented before, all primary studies were assessed
considering eight quality aspects to ensure their credibility
and relevance to this review. The purpose of this analysis
was to establish an objective evaluation that all papers
selected could actually contribute to the conclusions of this
review. To do that, each quality criteria was classified as
positive (1) or negative (0).
Table 3 presents the results of this quality assessment of
each one of all 52 selected papers. Columns "Q1" to "Q8"
represent all of the criteria defined by questions to evaluate
the following aspects of publications: Focus, Research,
Objectives, Context, Data Collection, Research Project,
Validation and Added Value. As mentioned before, all of the
selected papers were marked "1" in both "Focus" and
"Added Value" criteria. All studies with negatives answers
(0) in one of those two criteria were removed during the
selection stage.

All of the papers that were analyzed in this review
provided information on the research method, adding an
important value regarding its relationship with the scientific
method. Considering that all studies applied some sort of
formal research method, all criteria scored above 70%,
except one where data collection scored 67%. Even so, this
lack of clarity as to the methods of data collection in some of
the works does not generally compromise the quality of the
selected papers.
VI.
DISCUSSION
After
performing
the
search,
data
extraction
and
synthesis of primary studies, the authors were able to identify
some
patterns
regarding
capacity
planning
of
cloud
computing workloads. At first, it was possible to conclude
that cloud computing - and the process of capacity planning
for workloads running on cloud - is a very recent field of
research and also subject to a lot of entropy, given the
characteristic of being fast evolving within computer science.
It is also possible to conclude that there is a lack of
standardization of capacity planning methods for cloud
computing workloads and methods that are not intensive on
historical use data. This was identified after the classification
of primary studies in a parallel to research questions - that
covers both aspects mentioned previously. The majority of
studies applied historical use data to predict future resource
demands for a specific type of workload - such as IoT
(Internet of Things) solutions, database and so forth - using
machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.
A. Cloud Capacity Planning models
Capacity planning is a process that is not applied only in
the field of computer science. Most engineering sciences - or
any field that works with limited resources - need to address
how to manage and properly apply resources to meet
changing and constant evolving demands.
As such, in cloud computing environments, in which
resources are offered as services, they are considered as
practically infinite - as long as the customer pays for it.
Capacity planning models are being applied to manage how
to use resources efficiently and in a well architected way.
This research has found that although scientific literature
covers formal methods to perform capacity planning for
cloud computing workloads, there is no standardization
regarding inputs and outputs, processes and generalization,
to cover broader scenarios and types of workloads.
B. Cloud Capacity Planning models for cloud computing
workloads with no historical use
An important finding of this review was that most of
capacity planning methods for cloud computing workloads
consider historical data use for understanding demands needs
and for planning. This empirical approach shows some
efficiency – especially when using historical data as an input
for prediction models – but it often fails to deliver a higher
percentage of assertiveness on new workloads. Another gap
on this type of approach is that when performing capacity
planning for an unprecedented type of workload – such as
innovative or disruptive software – whereby there is no
historical data for that workload; this leads current methods
to apply a benchmark as input for those prediction models,
decreasing percentage of assertiveness on capacity planning
metrics for new or unprecedented workloads.
C. Cloud Capacity Planning models based on type of
workloads and architectural characteristic
Scientific literature analyzed in this review showed that
there are methods to perform capacity planning for specific
types of workloads – such as IoT, database, fog computing
and so forth. However, those models vary widely in their
method, calculations, and, especially, assertiveness.
In this sense, this systematic review has not found
generalist models which could cover capacity planning
broadly
and
which
could
also
consider
specific
characteristics of different types of workloads. The authors
believe that standardization and generalization in the method
would enhance scientific evolution for capacity planning of
cloud computing workloads.

D. Towards Cloud Capacity Planning
As presented previously, one of the main challenges of
working with cloud computing environments is how to
properly plan and calculate the amount of resources needed
for a specific set of workload. Besides the use of historical
data as major input to predict resource demands and the
absence of generalist models for capacity planning, our study
found another set of challenges:

Standardization: The lack of standards in gathering
and provisioning capacity planning models makes
reuse difficult;

Assertiveness: Although current models deliver
some capacity planning metrics, those calculations
often
fail
to
deliver
a
high
percentage
of
assertiveness to define resource needs;

Generalization: Most of current models address
specific types of workloads, and do not cover a
more generalist workload based on its architecture,
for instance.
VII.
CONCLUSION
This
systematic
review
focuses
on
mapping
and
identifying studies that aim to establish a formal process for
capacity planning of cloud computing workloads. In the
search phase, 504 papers were found, of which 52 were
classified as primary studies, following applied selection and
quality criteria.
All papers were classified considering their focus on
answering the research questions. After this stage, a quality
analysis was performed to access how the papers addressed
eight different quality criteria, as this method was applied to
ensure that each study covered formal scientific methods and
covered relevant aspects of this systematic review.
In regards to the aspects of capacity planning, the
majority of studies covered some type of formal method to
perform capacity planning of cloud computing workloads.
Most of them focused on historical data use to somehow
predict future resource demands. To do that, machine
learning and artificial intelligence techniques were generally
applied. Another important aspect in parallel to research
questions is that no general method or framework was found
to cover different type of workloads - although there are
methods to perform cloud capacity planning for specific
workloads, as mentioned before, each method however
establishes a different approach and is focused in analyzing a
specific type of workload.
In order to expand the results found and to improve the
conclusions of this systematic review, some considerations
about the limitations of this study need to be highlighted:

Perhaps considering a wider period of publications -
more than 3 years of publishing - even the great
entropy of the subject;

Apply search strings that include more keywords
with terms related to the object of this research,
such as “Resource Management”;

Look for capacity planning challenges in other
science and engineering references, given that
resource-limited scenarios is a characteristic not
only present in computer science.
For future work and further research, it would be
important to analyze specifically capacity planning methods
that do not apply historical data use - considering that not all
software projects have a precedent of use, such as for
innovative and disruptive software - and also to cover
different types of workloads - since current methods aim to
analyze specific types of cloud computing workloads.
