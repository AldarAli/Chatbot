Abstract—The Global Positioning System (GPS), which has 
various military and civilian applications, is designed to 
estimate the locations of objects including the user. In order to 
enhance the desired GPS signal and to efficiently suppress the 
interference signals, the Angle of Arrival (AOA) information 
for the GPS signal is required on the environment of high-
power interferers. After despreading based on a conventional 
despreader, the GPS AOA can be estimated using the 
conventional AOA estimation algorithm such as Multiple 
Signal Classification (MUSIC). However, we must select the 
GPS AOA from all estimated AOAs, because the result of 
MUSIC includes AOAs of GPS and interference signals. In 
order to overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose the 
GPS AOA estimation algorithm based on a null despreader. In 
this technique, we compare the estimated AOAs based on the 
conventional despreader and based on the null despreader. 
The proposed technique efficiently estimates and selects the 
desired GPS AOA when existing high-power interference 
signals. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed 
technique via a representative computer simulation example.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Location Detection Technology (LDT) is utilized in 
a variety of industrial areas and GPS is one of the 
representative LDTs for estimating the location of users or 
objects [1]-[3]. Since GPS employs the low-power Direct-
Sequence Spread-Spectrum (DSSS) signal, its Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (SNR) is very low (typically as low as -30 dB) 
and it suffers from the high-power jamming (interference) 
signals, which Jammer-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) can exceed 40 
dB [4]. Also, interference signals have various different 
forms, such as Continuous Waveform (CW) and Frequency 
Modulated (FM) signals as the Constant Modulus (CM) 
signal, a Wide-Band (WB) noise jammer, and a pulsed 
jammer which has periodic on/off characteristics [5][6]. 
Although the low SNR problem can be solved by the large 
spreading gain ( ≈ 43 dB) of GPS, the high JSR problem 
might cause the serious location estimation error for the 
conventional GPS receiver. In order to solve this problem, 
we employ the adaptive beamforming techniques based on 
the GPS AOA information, such as the Minimum-Variance-
Distortionless-Response (MVDR) [7][8] and the adaptive 
Generalized Sidelobe Canceler (GSC) [9][10]. 
Since the GPS signal power before despreading is lower 
than the noise power level, it is not possible to estimate the 
GPS AOA using the conventional AOA estimator such as 
MUSIC. After despreading, the GPS AOA can be estimated 
using the MUSIC algorithm because it is higher than the 
noise level, but we must select the GPS AOA from all 
estimated results because they include AOAs of the high-
power interference signals. In this paper, we propose the 
GPS AOA estimation technique based on a null depsreader, 
which efficiently estimates and selects the GPS AOA 
information in the high JSR environment. The estimated 
results based on the null despreader do not include the GPS 
AOA but include AOAs of interference signals, because it is 
designed to reject the GPS signal while retaining the other 
interference signals [11]. On the other hand, the estimated 
results based on the conventional despreader include AOAs 
of the GPS signal and interferers. In order to select the GPS 
AOA, we compare both results based on the conventional 
and null despreaders, and determine the AOA included in 
results of the conventional despreader but excluded in results 
of the null despreader, as the GPS AOA. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 
II, we define the received signal model for the GPS signal, 
interference or jamming signal, and Additive White 
Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Section III describes the proposed 
GPS AOA estimation algorithm based on the null despreader. 
The performance of the proposed technique is discussed by 
the representative computer simulation results in Section IV. 
Finally, conclusions are presented in Section V.

GPS AOA ESTIMATION BASED ON NULL 
DESPREADER 
In this section, we describe the GPS AOA estimation 
technique based on the null despreader, which efficiently 
estimates and selects the GPS AOA when high-power 
interference signals are present. Figure 1 shows the system 
architecture for AOA estimation of the GPS signal, 
consisting of a conventional despreader, a null despreader, 
AOA estimators, and a comparator.

B. AOA Estimation Based on Null Despreader Output 
A null despreader is designed to eliminate the GPS signal 
and its code consists of ten identical C/A codes and ten 
identical negative C/A codes. An example of the null 
despreadering code can be given by

C. Selection of GPS AOA 
Although the estimated AOAs based on the conventional 
despreader consist of AOAs for interference and GPS signals, 
the estimated AOAs based on the null despreader consist of 
AOAs for only interference signals. Since the estimated 
AOAs of interference signals based on both despreaders are 
identical, we determine the AOA included in the results 
based on the conventional despreader but not included in the 
results based on the null despreader, as the GPS AOA. 
Figure 2 shows a flow-chart of the proposed GPS AOA 
estimation technique. In order to suppress interference 
signals, the estimated AOA information of the GPS signal is 
applied to the adaptive beamformer, such as MVDR or GSC. 
IV. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION 
In this section, we provide a computer simulation 
example to demonstrate the performance of the proposed 
GPS AOA estimation technique based on the null despeader, 
when the high-power interference signals exist. Assuming 
that we employ 
M = 8
 antenna elements at the receiver, the 
received signal consists of two CW interference signals, one 
FM interference signal, two WB noise interference signals, 
one pulsed interference signal with the period of 100 samples, 
and AWGN. The parameters of these signals are summarized 
in Table II. In addition, SNR of the GPS signal is -30 dB, 
JSR of each interference signal is 60 dB, and the modulation 
index and the normalized modulation frequency of the FM 
interferer are 
β = 0.05
 and 
0.001
mf
=
, respectively.

Figure 5. Inverse of MUSIC cost function for the null despreading output. 
The spectrum of the received signal, which includes two 
CW, one FM, two WB noise, and one pulsed interferes, is 
shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the inverse of MUSIC 
cost function for the conventional despreading output, at the 
78 °  elevation angle, which consists of seven peaks 
corresponding to AOAs of one GPS signal (azimuth angle 
( °): 27) and six interference signals (azimuth angles ( °): -81, 
-59, -29, 2, 48, 71). Figure 5 shows the inverse of MUSIC 
cost function for the null despreading output, at the 78 °  
elevation angle, which consists of six peaks corresponding to 
AOAs of six interference signals (azimuth angles ( °): -81, -
59, -29, 2, 48, 71). Comparing peaks in Figure 4 and Figure 
5, we select a peak, which is included in peaks of Figure 4 
but excluded in peaks of Figure 5, as the GPS AOA. 
 
 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The GPS AOA information is the most important factor 
for enhancing the quality of the GPS signal and suppressing 
the high-power interference signals. In this paper, we 
proposed the efficient GPS AOA estimation technique based 
on a null despreader, which is designed to remove the GPS 
signal but retain interference signals. Using the conventional 
AOA estimator such as MUSIC, the estimated result based 
on the conventional despreading output includes AOAs of 
the GPS and interference signals. However, the estimated 
AOA result based on the null despreading output includes 
AOAs of only interference signals but excludes the GPS 
AOA. In the proposed technique, we compare both results 
and select the AOA which is included in the result of the 
conventional despreader but is not included in the result of 
the null despreader, as the GPS signal. The estimated GPS 
AOA is applied to the adaptive beamformer for rejecting 
interference signals. The performance of the proposed GPS 
AOA estimation scheme was illustrated by the computer 
simulation example. The final version of the paper will 
include additional computer simulations and more details 
about algorithm.
