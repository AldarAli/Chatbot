Abstract—In this paper, we present a simulator of multi-service
switching networks with various resource management mecha-
nisms. The network can be offered three types of trafﬁc streams:
Erlang, Engset and Pascal, generated by multi-service sources.
Each multi-service source can generate calls of a number of
trafﬁc classes. In addition, the paper presents an analysis of the
inﬂuence of different parameters upon the trafﬁc characteristics
of switching networks.

INTRODUCTION
Working out effective and efﬁcient methods for managing
resources in nodes of communication networks, especially in
the case of multi-service networks that rely on virtualization of
resources, is a complex issue. One of the fundamental difﬁcul-
ties arises from the necessity of servicing by switching nodes
of the networks different classes of trafﬁc streams [1][2][3].
In order to obtain a desirable admission policy for calls of
different trafﬁc classes as well as a desirable level of usage of
resources, many different strategies of resource management
in multi-service network have been elaborated. The ones of
the most effective strategies can be reservation mechanisms of
resources, both dynamic (executed on-line and securing well-
balanced access to network resources) [4], and static (executed
appropriately ahead of time with time advancement) [4], as
well as threshold [4][5] and priority mechanisms [4].
In order to fully determine the inﬂuence of resource
management mechanisms on the effectiveness of switching
nodes of telecommunications networks we have to determine
their inﬂuence on switching networks that are the key element
of each node in the network. In this paper we describe an
original simulation program for a determination of trafﬁc
characteristics of switching networks with various resource
management mechanisms and multi-service trafﬁc sources.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
the structure of trafﬁc offered to the multi-service switching
network. Section 3 describes the control mechanisms used in
switching networks to control access to resources. Section 4
includes a description of the simulator and presents methods
for a simulation of different types of trafﬁc (Erlang, Engset and
Pascal trafﬁc). Section 5 presents the results of the simulation
experiments. Finally, the conclusions and summary of the
paper are provided in Section 6.

RELATED WORK
The inﬂuence of resource management mechanisms on the
effectiveness of multi-service communications systems can be
determined on the basis of both analytical methods [6][7] and
simulation tools [8]. In the case of the analytical methods,
we can obtain a limited number of trafﬁc characteristics,
under limited assumptions. For example, none of methods
of switching networks analysis, known to the authors, take
into account other than random algorithms of link selection
in outgoing directions or interstage links. So far, no analytical
methods have been developed that allow switching network
modeling with any given number of attempts to set up a new
connection, and with trafﬁc streams other than Erlang streams.
The existing limitations of analytical methods have led to
the development of a switching networks simulator [8]. The
simulation model of switching network with trafﬁc manage-
ment mechanisms developed in [8], however, was limited to
multi-service switching networks with single-service sources
[8][9][10]. Consequently, in order to determine the inﬂuence of
many parameters not taken into account in existing analytical
models, and, additionally, the multi-service sources (a multi-
service trafﬁc source is the source that can generate calls
of different classes [6][11]), the simulation model of the
multi-service switching networks with multi-service sources is
presented in the paper. According to the authors’ knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst simulator of the switching networks with multi-
service trafﬁc sources.

STRUCTURE OF OFFERED TRAFFIC
In the considered model, m trafﬁc classes that belonged
to the set M = {1, 2, ..., m} were deﬁned. A given class
c is deﬁned by the number tc of demanded BBUs (Basic
Bandwidth Units) required to set up a new connection of
class c and the parameter µc of the exponential distribution
of the service time of calls of class c [11]. The switching
network is offered three types of trafﬁc streams - Erlang,
Engset and Pascal trafﬁc streams. Each stream is generated by
a source that belongs to an appropriate set of trafﬁc sources:
ZEr,i, ZEn,j and ZPa,k. In the considered system, sI sets
of trafﬁc sources generating Erlang trafﬁc streams, sJ sets
of trafﬁc sources generating Engset trafﬁc streams and sK
sets of trafﬁc sources generating Pascal trafﬁc streams were
deﬁned. The total number of the sets of trafﬁc sources in
the system is S = sI + sJ + sK. The sources that belong
to the set ZEr,i can generate Erlang call streams from the
set CEr,i = {1, 2, ..., cEr,i} according to the available set of
services. The sources that belong to the set ZEn,j can generate
Engset call streams from the set CEn,j = {1, 2, ..., cEn,j},
whereas the sources that belong to the set ZPa,k can generate
Engset call streams from the set CPa,k = {1, 2, ..., cPa,k}.
The participation of class c (from the set M) in the structure

of trafﬁc generated by sources from the appropriate sets ZEr,i,
ZEn,j and ZPa,k can be determined by the parameter ηEr,i,c,

RESOURCE ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS
A. Bandwidth Reservation
Bandwidth reservation in the switching network consists
in introducing the reservation threshold Rc [1][9][12][13]. Rc
determines the borderline state of the link (or the group of
links), in which servicing the class c calls is still possible. All
states higher than Rc belong to the reservation space Sc in
which the class c calls are blocked: Sc = V − Rc, where V
is the total capacity of the group. The reservation mechanism
was introduced to the classes that belonged to the set R which
is a sub-set of the set M.
B. Threshold Mechanisms
In switching networks with the applied threshold mecha-
nism the parameters of the offered trafﬁc change depending
on the load of the system [6][9][14]. In the algorithm, the
threshold mechanism is introduced to outgoing directions
only [6]. According to this algorithm, for each class of calls a
set of thresholds is individually introduced. For example, for
class c we have a set (Qc,1, Qc,2, . . . , Qc,q). In each threshold
area u of class c {Qc,u < n ≤ Qc,u+1} a trafﬁc stream of class
c, deﬁned by own set of parameters {tc,u, µc,u}, is offered. Ad-
ditionally, we assume that tc,0 > tc,1 > . . . > tc,u > . . . > tc,q
and µ−1
c,0 ≤ µ−1
c,0 ≤ . . . ≤ µ−1
c,u ≤ . . . ≤ µ−1
c,q.
C. Hysteresis Mechanism
The hysteresis mechanisms also change trafﬁc parameters
of carried trafﬁc in relation to the occupancy state of a
system [7][9]. In hysteresis algorithm, when the load of the
system exceeds the pre-deﬁned limit Q1, a decrease in the
number of assigned BBUs for calls (currently offered and
serviced) of classes belonging to the set H ensues and the
average holding time of the call may be increased. When
the load of the system is below the hysteresis limit Q2, this
situation is followed by an increase in the number of BBUs
allocated to the compressed calls from the set H and a decrease
in the holding time of these calls.
V.
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS
The developed simulator of switching networks was written
in C++ using the object programming technique. The process
interaction method was used to develop the simulation model.
Thus developed simulator allows us to determine values of the
blocking probability, loss probability, as well as values of traf-
ﬁc serviced by calls of individual trafﬁc classes, depending on
the threshold mechanism involved, in switching networks with
point-to-point selection, point-to-group selection and point-
to-group selection with a number of attempts to set up a
connection. The input data of the simulator are: the capacity
and the structure of the switching network. For each trafﬁc
class, the number of demanded BBUs, service time and the
parameters related to the introduced threshold mechanisms
(the demanded number of BBUs in particular threshold areas,
threshold boundaries) are given. The sets of trafﬁc sources and
their type (Erlang, Engset, Pascal) are deﬁned. In addition, the
average value of trafﬁc offered to a single BBU of the system
is also given.
In order to perform simulation experiments for a system
with the capacity V and composed of switches υ × υ of links
in which the capacity of a single link is f BBU, the values of
the following parameters have to be introduced: the number of
deﬁned trafﬁc classes m, the number tc of demanded BBUs
necessary to set up a connection of class c and the average
service time µ−1
c
for a call of class c, the number of sets of
trafﬁc sources sI, sJ, sK, the sets ZEr,i, ZEn,j and ZPa,k of
trafﬁc sources, the number of classes cEr,i, cEn,j and cPa,k that
belong respectively to the sets CEr,i, CEn,j and CPa,k of trafﬁc
classes, the participation ηEr,i,c, ηEn,j,c and ηPa,k,c of calls of
class c in trafﬁc generated by sources that belong respectively
to the sets ZEr,i, ZEn,j and ZPa,k of trafﬁc sources and the
number NEn,j or SPa,k of Engset trafﬁc sources from the set
ZEn,j and Pascal trafﬁc sources from the set ZPa,k, threshold
boundaries Qc,u, deﬁned in the output directions for calls of
class c, the number of BBUs tc,u demanded by calls of class
c in the threshold area u and the average service time µ−1
c,u for
a call of class c in area u.
Additionally, the average trafﬁc a offered to a single BBU
in the system is given. On the basis of the above parameters
it is possible to determine in the simulator the intensity λEr,i,
γEn,j or γPa,k of calls generated by the sources of a given
type of the trafﬁc stream. In the case of the Engset and
Pascal streams, the intensities γEn,j and γPa,k determine the call
intensity for calls generated by a single free source. Thus, the
parameters λEr,i, γEn,j and γPa,k can be determined, depending
on the average trafﬁc offered to a single BBU:
λEr,i =
aV υ
S
[∑cEr,i
c=1 tcηEr,i,c
] [∑cEr,i
c=1 µcηEr,i,c
],

γEn,j =

.
(4)
The parameters determined on the basis of (2), (3), and (4) can
be treated as the parameters for the exponential distribution
that describes the new call arrival process.
With a determination of the blocking probability, the con-
dition for the termination of the simulation experiment is the
duration time for individual series necessary to generate a
given number of calls of the least active class (most frequently
this is a class with the highest number of demanded BBUs).
In the case of the loss probability, the condition for the
termination of the simulation experiment is the appropriate
aggregated number of generated calls of the least active class.
The time required to generate a given number of calls is
chosen in such a way as to obtain 95% conﬁdence interval.
Conventionally, the average result is calculated on the basis of
5 series. In practice, to obtain the conﬁdence interval at the
level of 95% it is necessary to generate about 1,000,000 calls
of the least active class.

The algorithm according to which the simulation program
operates can be written on the basis of the following steps:
1. Initial conﬁguration of the simulation model – creation of all
sources that generate calls of different trafﬁc classes. 2. Setting
the system time to zero. 3. Activation of trafﬁc sources and
events display (call arrival) in the list. 4. Checking of the
simulation termination condition. If the condition is satisﬁed,
then the simulation is terminated and the results are recorded
in a ﬁle. 5. Updating of the system time to the time of the
appearance of the ﬁrst event from the list. 6. Execution of the
ﬁrst event item from the list. 7. Removal of the ﬁrst event item
from the list and return to step 2.
Two events were deﬁned in the simulation model of the
switching network: the arrival of a new call and the termi-
nation of call service. According to the process interaction
method, these events are serviced by one function. This
function has a different form for each type of Erlang, Engset
and Pascal trafﬁc stream. The approach described above makes
it possible to deﬁne many different trafﬁc classes in the system
and to allocate (assign) them to different types of sets of trafﬁc
sources. In the initial conﬁguration of the simulation model it
is essential to create all sources that generate calls of different
trafﬁc classes.
A. Simulation of a system with the sets of Erlang sources
Consider a system in which the set i of Erlang trafﬁc
sources ZEr,i has been deﬁned. In the system, also the set
CEr,i = {1, 2, ..., cEr,i} of trafﬁc classes whose calls can be
generated by sources from the set ZEr,i has been deﬁned.
In the initial conﬁguration of the system it is necessary to
plan ahead the arrival of a call of class c from the set
CEr,i. The function that executes events related to the set
of Erlang trafﬁc sources can be described in the following
way: 1. Planning of the arrival (appearance) of a new call
generated by a source that belongs to the set ZEr,i according
to the exponential distribution where the parameter is the
intensity λEr,i. Allocation of a given call to class c from
the set CEr,i, on the basis of the parameter ηEr,i,c, according
to the uniform distribution. Recording the event in the list.
2. Checking whether the system has sufﬁcient resources to
admit a call for service: a) Checking whether any of the links
of the demanded output direction has at least tc free BBUs. If
not, the call is lost due to the external blocking. b) Checking
whether there is a path between the input link, at which a call
appeared, and the output link of the demanded direction that
has at least tc unoccupied BBUs. If not, the call is lost due to
the internal blocking. If any of the conditions (a) or (b) is not
satisﬁed, next steps are omitted. 3. Occupation of the resources
demanded by a call of class c. 4. Planning of the termination
of service according to the exponential distribution where the
parameter is the intensity µc. Recording the event in the list.
5. Termination of service and release of resources.
B. Simulation of a system with the sets of Engset sources
Consider a system in which the set j of Engset trafﬁc
sources ZEn,j has been deﬁned. In the system, calls from the set
CEn,j = {1, 2, ..., cEn,j} of trafﬁc classes can be generated by
NEn,j sources from the set ZEn,j. It is necessary to plan in the
initial conﬁguration of the system an appearance (arrival) of a
call of class c from the set CEn,j generated by each of NEn,j
sources. Hence, the function executing the events related to
the set of Engset trafﬁc sources can be presented as follows:
1. Checking whether the system has sufﬁcient resources to
admit a call for service: a) Checking whether any of the links
of the demanded output link has at least tc free BBUs. If
not, the call is lost due to the external blocking. b) Checking
whether there is a path between the input link at which a call
appears and the output link of the demanded direction that
has at least tc free BBUs. If not, the call is lost due to the
internal blocking. If any of the conditions (a) or (b) cannot
be satisﬁed, pass on to step 5. 2. Occupation of the resources
demanded by a call of class c. 3. Planning of the termination
of service according to the exponential distribution where the
parameter is the intensity µc. Recording the event in the list.
4. Termination of service and release of resources. 5. Planning
of the appearance (arrival) of a new call generated by a free
source from the set ZEn,j of trafﬁc sources according to the
exponential distribution where the parameter is the intensity
γJ,j. Allocation of the generated call to class c from the set
CEn,j on the basis of the parameter ηEn,j,c according to the
uniform distribution. Recording the event in the list.
Unlike the system with the sets of Erlang sources, in the
system with the sets of Engset sources a generation of a new
call is possible only when there is a free source (from among
NEn,j sources) capable of generating this call. This condition
will be satisﬁed in a situation when the call service process
for another call is completed. Hence, in the function related to
event service, a termination of service for a call is immediately
followed by a possibility to plan an arrival of another call.
C. Simulation of a system with the sets of Pascal sources
Consider a system in which a set of Pascal trafﬁc sources
ZPa,k has been deﬁned. The system also has a deﬁned set
CPa,k = {1, 2, ..., cPa,k} of trafﬁc sources whose calls can
be generated by SPa,k sources from the set ZPa,k. In the
initial conﬁguration of the system it is necessary to plan the
appearance (arrival) of a call of class c from the set CPa,k,
generated by each of SPa,k sources. Therefore, the function
executing the events related to the set of Pascal trafﬁc sources
leads to the execution of the following task: 1. Planning of the
arrival of a new call, generated by a source from the set ZPa,k,
according to the exponential distribution where the parameter
is the intensity γPa,k. Allocation of the call to class c from
the set CPa,k, on the basis of the parameter ηPa,k,c, according
to the uniform distribution. Recording the event in the list.
2. Checking whether the system has sufﬁcient resources to
service the call: a) Checking whether any of the links of the
demanded output direction has at least tc free BBUs. If not, the
call is lost due to the external blocking. b) Checking whether
there is a path between the input link at which a call appears
(arrives) and the output link of the demanded output direction
that has at least tc free BBUs. If not, the call is lost due to
the internal blocking. If any of the conditions (a) or (b) is
not satisﬁed, the next steps are omitted. 3. Occupation of the
resources that are demanded by a call of class c. 4. Planning
of the termination of service according to the exponential
distribution where the parameter is the intensity µc. Recording
the event in the list. 5. Addition of two sources (at the moment
of the admittance of a given call). Planning of the arrival
of new calls generated by new sources from the set ZPa,k
according to the exponential distribution where the parameter
49

is the intensity γPa,k. Allocation of new calls to class c from
the set CPa,k on the basis of the parameter ηPa,k,c according
to the uniform distribution. Recording the event in the list.
6. Termination of service and release of resources. a) Removal
of two sources, currently not serviced, at the moment of a
termination of service of a given call. b) Removal of the events
related to the removed source.

SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS OF SWITCHING
NETWORKS WITH THRESHOLD MECHANISMS
The simulator makes it possible to examine the inﬂuence of
different factors on the values of the blocking probability and
on the values of carried trafﬁc. The factors involved include:
the number of attempts to set up a connection and the link
occupation strategy. This section presents an extensive set of
results that determine the inﬂuence of different parameters on
the characteristics of switching networks such as, for example,
the applied threshold mechanism, the number of attempts to set
up a connection, and the link occupation strategy. The results
of the simulation experiments are presented in the from of
graphs with conﬁdence intervals that have been determined
on the basis of the t-Student distribution (with 95-percent
conﬁdence interval) for 5 series. The duration time for each
of the series has been determined on the basis of the time
required to generate 1,000,000 calls of the least active class.
In each case, the conﬁdence interval does not exceed 5% of
the average value of the result of the simulation experiment.
A. Inﬂuence of the applied threshold mechanism
To examine the inﬂuence of the applied resource access
control mechanism on the values of carried trafﬁc and the
blocking probability simulation experiments were performed.
Three types of mechanisms were considered: reservation,
threshold and hysteresis mechanisms.
The study was carried out for the following parameters:
structure of switching network: υ = 4, f = 32 PJP, V =
128 PJP; structure of offered trafﬁc: trafﬁc classes: m = 3,
t1,0 = 1 PJP, µ−1
1,0 = 1, t2,0 = 4 PJP, µ−1
2,0 = 1, t3,0 = 8 PJP,
µ−1
3,0 = 1; sets of trafﬁc sources: S = 3, CEr,1 = {1}, ηEr,1 = 1,
CEn,2 = {2}, ηEn,2 = 1, NEn,2 = 128, CPa,3 = {3}, ηPa,3 = 1,
SPa,3 = 128; reservation mechanism: R1 = R2 = 90 PJP,
R = {1, 2}; threshold mechanism: t2,1 = 2 PJP, µ−1
2,1 = 2,
t3,1 = 4 PJP, µ−1
3,1 = 2, q3 = 1, Q3,1 = 90 PJP; hysteresis
mechanism: t2,1 = 2 PJP, µ−1
2,1 = 2, t3,1 = 4 PJP, µ−1
3,1 = 2,
Q1 = 100 PJP, Q2 = 80 PJP, H = {2, 3};
In the case when the hysteresis mechanism or the threshold
mechanism have been applied to the switching networks under
consideration we can observe the highest values of carried
trafﬁc as compared to a switching network without those
mechanisms being introduced. A reverse situation is to be
found in the case of switching networks with reservation
mechanisms (Figure 1).
In switching networks in which a proper threshold mech-
anism or a threshold mechanism with hysteresis have been
introduced it was observable that in the case of classes that
did not undergo these mechanisms the blocking probability
for low intensities of trafﬁc was lower than the blocking prob-
ability in networks without the introduced mechanisms. With

Blocking probability for calls of class 2 in relation to the applied

the trafﬁc intensity being increased, a reverse situation was
observed (Figure 2). For classes that undergo the introduced
proper threshold mechanisms or threshold mechanisms with
hysteresis, it was observed that the blocking probability was
always lower than the blocking probability in networks without
introduced relevant mechanisms (Figure 3). This behavior of
the system results from the fact that calls of classes that
undergo the threshold mechanisms are allocated the number
of BBUs that is not higher, and in many cases lower, than in
the case of switching networks without threshold mechanisms.
The blocking probability in switching networks with reser-
vation mechanisms for trafﬁc classes that undergo these mech-
anisms is always higher than the blocking probability in net-
works with no introduced mechanisms (Figure 2). Whereas in
the case of classes that do not undergo reservation mechanisms
(privileged classes), the blocking probability is always lower
than the blocking probability in networks without new call
admission control mechanisms (Figure 3). Such a behavior of

The blocking probability for calls of class 2 in relation to the
number of attempts to set up a connection
the system results from the fact that for classes for which
reservation boundaries have been deﬁned the area of available
network resources has been thus limited (decreased). In turn,
for classes that do not undergo the reservation mechanism the

B. Inﬂuence of the number of attempts
As a result of the simulation experiments carried out in the
course of the study it was possible to examine the inﬂuence
of the number of attempts to set up a connection inside the
switching network on the values of carried trafﬁc and the
blocking probability. The maximum number of attempts to set
up a connection in the network is equal to the number of links
of a given output direction and is υ. The number of attempts
is equal to 1 and corresponds to the point-to-point selection
in the switching network, while υ attempts correspond to the
point-to-group selection.
The study was performed for the following structure of
the switching network: structure of switching network: υ = 4,
f = 32 PJP, V = 128 PJP; trafﬁc classes: m = 3, t1,0 = 1 PJP,
µ−1
1,0 = 1, t2,0 = 4 PJP, µ−1
2,0 = 1, t3,0 = 8 PJP, µ−1
3,0 = 1; sets

ηEn,2 = 1, NEn,2 = 128, CPa,3 = {3}, ηPa,3 = 1, SPa,3 = 128;
While analyzing the systems under consideration in view of
the inﬂuence of the number of attempts to set up a connection
in the network on the value of carried trafﬁc and the values
of blocking probabilities, a number of interesting observations
can be drawn up.
In many cases, only one attempt to set up a connection
between a given input and a given output is not sufﬁcient to
determine a free connection path. The probability of ﬁnding a

Percentage change in the value of carried trafﬁc in relation to the

free connecting path increases with the increase in the number
of attempts of setting up a connection. The highest values of
carried trafﬁc have been then observed for networks in which
the number of attempts to set up a connection is υ (Figure 4).
The blocking probability is the lowest in networks in which the
number of attempts to set up a connection is υ. The biggest
differences in the values of the blocking probabilities were
observed between 1 and 2 attempts (Figures 5-6).
C. Inﬂuence of the link occupation strategy
The last factor inﬂuencing the changes in the values of
carried trafﬁc and the values of blocking probabilities to be
examined in the study was the link occupation strategy. The
relevant simulation experiments were performed to evaluate the
inﬂuence of the adopted link occupation strategy on the values
of carried trafﬁc and the blocking probability. The experiments
involved the following strategies: random selection (inter-stage
links and output links of the switching network are randomly
selected), sequential selection (the selection of inter-stage links
of the network and output links begins with the ﬁrst free link,
while links are numbered from 1 to υ), and the so-called two-
sided selection (calls of classes with lower demands begin the
occupation of links from the numbers 1, 2, ..., whereas calls of
classes that demand the highest number of BBUs to set up a
connection occupy links starting from the numbers υ, υ−1, ...).

The highest values of carried trafﬁc in the switching network
with point-to-group selection were observed for networks with
the two-sided selection, whereas the lowest values for networks
with the random selection of links (Figure 7). In the analysis
of the inﬂuence of the link occupation strategy on the blocking
probability, for the classes that demanded the highest number
of BBUs, the lowest values were observed in the networks
with two-sided selection (Figure 10). A reverse situation was
recorded for the remaining trafﬁc classes (Figures 8, 9).

CONCLUSION
The papers presents the structure of the simulator of multi-
service switching networks with multi-service sources. The
developed simulator allows us to determine an inﬂuence of
the number of attempts to set up a connection and the link
occupation strategy on the values of the blocking probability
and on the values of carried trafﬁc. In the simulator, a selection
of various resource management algorithms has been imple-
mented. The obtained results makes it possible to select the

trafﬁc classes, maximization of the value of carried trafﬁc,
etc.). The simulator is also an indispensable tool for evaluation
of analytical models of multi-service switching networks with
multi-service sources.
