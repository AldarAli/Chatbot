Abstract— Resistive bend sensors have been increasingly 
used in different areas for their interesting property to 
change their resistance when bent. They can be employed in 
those systems where a joint rotation has to be measured, 
such as in biomedical systems to measure human joint static 
and dynamic postures. In spite of their interesting properties 
the commercial bend sensors have a resistance vs. bent angle 
characteristic which is not actually ideal as a linear function, 
to measure bend angles, would be. In this work, we have 
developed a way to calculate the sensor resistance for 
different bending angles with a generalized strip contour, in 
order to predict how shaping it with different non-uniform 
geometries changes the resistance dependence on bending 
angles, and investigate what kind of strip geometry can lead 
to a more linear behavior. 
Keywords– bend sensor; gesture recognition. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In order to measure human body kinematics, it is 
convenient to adopt sensors, which can measure bending 
angles with good precision despite a low cost.  
Commercial bend sensors are usually made of a few 
micrometer tick resistive material deposited onto a thicker 
plastic insulating substrate. The resistive strip is screen 
printed with a special carbon ink, to be applied on 
virtually any custom shape and size film [1]. Normally, 
however, as well as the overall sensor, it has a rectangular 
geometry, with one side somewhat larger than the other. 
The ink’s resistance value changes with bending due to an 
applied external force. The overall thickness is anyway 
negligible compared to the total largeness and lengthiness. 
All sensor materials, however, must be able to bend 
repeatedly without failure for the sensor to work. This 
kind of sensors are available on the market (Images SI Inc. 
[2], Flexpoint Sensor Systems Inc. [3]). 
These devices can be adopted as sensors when placed 
on different kind of joints with the larger side bent 
according to the joints. They can be applied to body joint 
as electronic goniometers, to realize goniometric sock for 
rotation assessment of body segments in human posture 
recognition [4,5,6]. 
From a characterization point of view, the model 
which takes into account the mechanical aspect of the 
sensor predicts a linear behavior of the electric resistive 
variation with the bending angle [7]. Nevertheless the 
sensor resistance has increasing derivatives, especially for 
small angles, which result in non linear characteristics, as 
provided by the electrical characterization of the sensors.  
The idea developed in this paper is to change the 
regular (rectangular) geometry of the sensor, cutting some 
part of it, in order to increase or decrease its resistance 
value, obtaining a linearization of its intrinsic non linear 
behavior. To this aim, the change of sensor resistance with 
bending angle has been modeled for a generalized 
resistive strip contour. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL   APPARATUS 
The apparatus employed for this analysis was designed 
to emulate, in a controlled environment, the behavior of 
commercial bend sensors, when applied to body joints to 
track segment rotations. Figure 1 provides a photo of a 
sensor strip sample.

Systems Inc. South Draper UT, USA) in 1:1 scale. 
Figure 2 shows a schematic of the experimental set-up. 
The sensor sample was laid as a cantilever beam on a 
metal hinge. In order to bend the sensor from 0 to +90 
degrees, the sample side connected to the electrodes was 
locked in a stationary clamp, fixed to a rotating platform 
operated by a step motor. The other side of the sensor was 
put in a sliding clamp to avoid the sample stretching. For 
this kind of sensors the resistive material must be external 
with respect to the rotation. Bending angle step amplitude 
was changed reliably with one degree resolution from a 
Labview interface serial connected to a PC. The step 
motor is a PD-109-57 sample from Trinamic, connected to 
the PC through a RS-232 cable. The sensor resistance 
measurement against different bending angles was 
obtained connecting a digital multimeter to the Labview 
setup [8]. 
We measured the characteristic of several commercial 
bend sensors. In particular, we investigated the behavior 
of 2 inches long Flexpoint non encapsulated sensors, 
polyester 
encapsulated 
sensors 
and 
polyimide 
encapsulated sensors, when bent on a 8 mm hinge.  
Measurements results, reported in Fig. 3, demonstrated 
the non linear mentioned characteristic. In particular the 
resistance variation is greater for non encapsulated sensors 
stands their higher flexibility, whereas the polyester one

exhibits better linearity. These imply that the resistive 
material must be non isotropic and must present non-
uniform variation when bent.  
The idea developed in this paper is to investigate how 
the change of a regular (rectangular) sensor geometry, 
cutting some part of it, increases its resistance value, 
obtaining a linearization of its intrinsic non linear 
behavior. In order to predict how shaping sensor resistive 
strip with different non-uniform geometries changes the 
resistance dependence on bending angles, this dependence 
has been calculated for a generalized resistive strip 
contour in the next section [9].

where the strip length have been divided into N

numerical integration. 
As previously affirmed, when the polyester or 
polyimide substrate is bent, the material of its resistive 
strip is stretched, and the sheet resistance increases around 
the bending rotation axis. Although it is rather difficult to 
physically model this phenomenon, an abstract model can 
be still attempted with a general Gaussian function 
centered on the rotation axis, supposed at a known 
distance LR from the strip longitudinal edge at x=0.

where the unknown parameters are the calibration 
factor K(φ), scaling the sheet resistance with the bending 
angle, and the variance σ which determines the 
longitudinal extension of the region around the bending 
axis where resistivity increases. To this parameter, it has 
been arbitrarily assigned a starting value 
σ = d 2
, where 
d is the hinge diameter. However, by comparison of model 
simulation and experimental measurements this value can 
be adjusted, although a constant value seems to fit better 
than one changing with the bending angle. 
As a consequence, the resistance variation of a 
rectangular sensor with the bending angle can be 
calculated as

It is worth to note that the calibration factor, even if 
calculated for a rectangular strip, is independent from the 
strip geometry. Then, the response of a non-uniform 
geometry can be calculated from the equations

where Hgeom is a constant factor dependent on sensor 
geometry, but independent from the bending angle. As a 
consequence, since K(φ) is linearly dependent from 
RS_rect(φ) as result from (8), even with non-uniform 
geometry the normalized sensor resistance is the same of 
that of a rectangular one given by (5). In other words, no 
linearity enhancement can be yield from non-uniform 
geometry in this case. 
So far, it has not been taken into account that, when 
the sensor is bent, the sample side not connected to the 
electrodes slides in a clamp of an amount equal to the arc 
of the hinge (diameter d) corresponding to the rotation 
angle, and the rotation axis moves away from the locked 
edge (x=0) of half this quantity, namely

where this time the geometric factor Hgeom is 
dependent on the bending angle. In this case, the 
normalized sensor resistance has a different behavior 
between uniform and non-uniform geometry. This fact 
will be exploited in the next section to investigate if 
particular geometries can lead to a linearization of its 
intrinsic non linear behavior. 
IV. SENSOR   PERFORMANCE   SIMULATION 
The question which now arises, of course, is whether it 
would be possible to optimize the resistive strip geometry 
to yield a linear behavior with bending angle. However it 
is to note that the highest non linearity is observed for 
small angles, where the sheet resistance has a little 
increase. As a consequence, the modulation of the sensor 
width has a little influence on its performance for small 
angles. Nevertheless, a contour optimization has been 
attempted investigating different simple geometries, in 
particular trials have been performed on rectangular, 
triangular and circular contours, where dimensions have 
been randomly optimized, on the basis of the rms error 
between the normalized sensor performance and an ideal 
linear one (nonlinearity error). This approach has been 
attempted on the 2 inch polyester sensor from Flexpoint, 
where the strip size has been set to 36×5.6 mm, with a 
double width respect to the standard one, to allow safe 
shrinking of the sensor width do not compromise the 
sensor capability to bend repeatedly without failure. 
Being the squared contour a particular case of the 
triangular one, results have been presented only for the 
last one. Random iterations have been tried sweeping 
three geometry parameters in the following ranges:

contour and the triangular cut.

The result of random optimization of strip contour 
dimension is reported in   Fig. 5, where calibrated sheet 
resistance Gaussian functions and their shift with bending 
angle has been superimposed. It can be noted that 
optimization suggests an almost square and deepest 
allowed cut as the best performing geometry.

Finally, the same random optimization can be also 
tried to enhance the linearity of a resistive divider, shown 
in Fig. 6, where the sensor is inserted in many 
applications, when it is the voltage across the sensor rather 
than its resistance that has to be processed.

Results have been plotted in Figs. 7 and 8, where the 
same optimization has been applied this time to a circular 
contour. Moreover, at each iteration corresponding to a 
particular contour, the reference resistance Rref has been 
swept inside the sensor resistance dynamic to yield the 
most linear behavior. Although not all results have been 
included in this paper for sake of brevity, it has been 
demonstrated that a square cut in sensor contour lets to 
achieve the best linearity performance, especially with a 
larger sensor width and deeper cuts, either for sensor 
resistance and voltage.

V. CONCLUSION 
The linearization of the bend sensor’s characteristic 
leads to undeniable advantages in joint rotation 
assessment. In this work a method to calculate resistance 
variation with bending angle for any resistive strip 
geometry has been proposed, and different contour 
geometry have been compared from the linearity point of 
view. Results have demonstrated, from one hand, that the 
best results can be obtained with a square cut, from the 
other hand, that the larger is the sensor width and deeper 
the cut in resistive strip contour, the more relevant is the 
enhancement in linearity performance, either for sensor 
resistance and voltage across it when inserted in a resistive 
divider.
