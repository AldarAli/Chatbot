Abstract—
Context
is
fast
becoming
a
fundamental
requirement in modern day application development. Key to
this
requirement
is
the
accuracy
of
the
contextualized
information being processed. Incorrectly interpreted context
can lead to a missed opportunity or an inappropriate user
interruption. Location is arguably one of the most significant
contexts that can add value to an applications perceived
intelligence. Timely and accurate knowledge of a user’s
position can vastly improve the precision of contextualized
information. Many noteworthy systems have been developed
that attempt to address the notion of localization in the indoor
environment. With the use of a myriad of technologies and
novel implementations these systems have somewhat overcome
the issues surrounding the level of accuracy in indoor
positioning. In actual fact, most of the research in the area of
Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) has been primarily focused
on solving the problem of positioning accuracy. All the time, an
equally
important
issue of
yield or
coverage
has
been
somewhat
overlooked.
Accuracy
becomes
somewhat
meaningless, to
an
extent,
in areas
where
even
coarse
positioning is unobtainable. It is the focus of this research to
address the issue of coverage in IPSs. The concept is to utilize
mobile devices to cooperatively locate devices that cannot be
‘seen’ by IPS’s in indoor environments. The methodology of
such an approach is to use a cooperation of devices at the
extremities of IPS ranges. These devices have themselves
already been positioned, but can ‘see’ beyond the IPSs current
range and can, in concert, locate devices that they can ‘see’.

INTRODUCTION
The problem of locating people or devices in all areas of
the indoor arena, is a challenge that, as of yet, remains
unsolved. Many technologies and techniques have been
employed in an attempt to find a solution, but none have
effectively done so. It is the focus of this particular research
to describe a framework and implementation whereby
mobile devices can assist in a collaborative fashion to extend
the capacity of an Indoor Positioning System, thereby adding
to the body of research in this area to help in the effort to
find a solution.
Access to location based information in mobile devices is
becoming ubiquitous. Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSSs), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) have
the capacity to locate a mobile device with enough precision
to provide adequate context to nearly any application
purpose. More importantly, it has the coverage to do so at a
global
level,
with
24
satellites
offering
an
almost
unobstructed view, providing the necessary infrastructure to
deliver such vast yields. GPS, through its success, has quietly
infiltrated most of our modern day lives. If you look just
beneath the surface of most modern day systems, you will
invariably find layers of GPS services. GPS controls key
pieces of infrastructure such as, traffic management systems
in modern cities. The atomic clocks on-board GPS satellites
send extremely accurate timing information, which is used to
synchronize traffic lights. GPS offers positioning estimates
accurate enough to now automatically land airplanes and
navigate emergency services directly to their destinations.
The requirements to use GPS is becoming more and more
trivial with advances in accuracy and the technological
advancements in hardware. Unfortunately, GPS positioning
signals do not have the strength to penetrate a buildings
fabric, after making the near 22,000 km journey to earth.
This makes its application as a Location Based System
(LBS)
in
the
indoor
arena
virtually
redundant.
A
comprehensive solution to the provision of accurate position
estimations and broad coverage in the indoor environment
has, proven somewhat problematic to deliver. The reasons
for this are wide ranging and cover a large area of research
[1-6],
identifying
issues
with
reflection,
refraction,
absorption and diffraction. Any of these issues can introduce
challenges when attempting to position using wireless
signals, especially so in the indoor environment. But a
fundamental problem is that one of the most commonly
implemented indoor positioning solutions use existing Wi-Fi
network components to locate devices within its range.
Although this technique offers obvious economic rewards,
utilizing a preinstalled infrastructure. These topologies were
typically designed to provide network coverage to mobile
devices rather than deliver an indoor location based solution.
Large areas without coverage are commonplace in these
networks, because network designers were not typically
concerned with providing 100% coverage for mobile data.
Furthermore, where a single Wireless Access Point (WAP)
can adequately provide network access to mobile devices,
three or more can be required to accurately position.
Hallways, toilet areas or other general purpose areas that
ordinarily would not require network coverage sometimes do
not get dedicated WAPs. Transient users navigating these
areas of the network can be un-locatable using this
infrastructure. Moreover, the indoor arena is an especially
noisy atmosphere, being home to other wireless devices such
as Bluetooth Headsets, Cordless Phones and Microwave
Ovens, which operate on the same frequency as a Wi-Fi
signal [6]. Considering users spend more time in an indoor
environment [7], the need for a solution is obvious. Outdoor

localization has quite a few years’ research and development
on
its
indoor
equivalent,
this
coupled
with
the
aforementioned difficulties provides for a fertile research
area at present.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II, a
description of the test environment is presented. Section III
describes the CAPTURE framework. An analysis of the
results found during testing are presented in Section IV and
evaluated in Section V. Finally, Section VI offers a
conclusion and some future implementations of CAPTURE.
II.
TEST ENVIRONMENT
The main campus building at Letterkenny Institute of
Technology (LyIT) was used as a live testbed for this
research. The building itself consists of 3 floor levels and
covers an area of approximately 20,000 sq. meters. It
contains a variety of rooms and room sizes, ranging from
computer labs, classrooms, lecture theatres, staff offices and
toilets. The college uses a variety (CISCO 892w, CISCO
Aironet 1140 Series and CISCO Aironet 2602e Series) of
802.11 Wi-Fi APs to provide network and internetwork
connectivity to its users, which is primarily made up of staff
and students numbering approximately 4000 in total. During
the summer of 2015, a survey of the indoor positioning
capacity of the Wi-Fi infrastructure of the LyIT campus was
undertaken. The Ekahau Site Survey (ESS) [8] application
was used to complete the survey. ESS is the industry
standard for designing, planning and maintaining Wi-Fi
network systems. The survey provided analysis of network
connectivity and performance, which further proved our
hypothesis that large areas of a building are not locatable
when using existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. The Ekahau Site
Survey 8.0 (ESS 8.0) system was used to perform a
Throughput Site Survey, this survey measures throughput as
well as jitter and packet loss to evaluate the Wi-Fi
performance of a network at given locations. It collates data,
which illustrates how the network is performing in that
particular area of the building. ESS is most commonly used
to assist with the designing and planning of new Wi-Fi
networks, as well as troubleshooting issues with existing Wi-
Fi implementations. It uses different observables to measure
aspects
of
the
wireless
network
infrastructure.
These
observables can measure range as well as Data Transfer
Rates, Level of Interference\Noise, Signal Strength, Signal to
Noise Ratio, Strongest Access Points and Ping Round Trip
Time. These can then be analyzed to measure the suitability
of a given area of a building to provide a level of service
with a specific technology. For example, tests can be
implemented and evaluated to highlight Wi-Fi blackspots or
areas with low coverage or high levels of congestion or
contention rates. The system generates heat maps of the
surveyed area to illustrate issues relating to network or
technology yield. An interesting facet of the ESS application
is its ability to configure the output to measure Wi-Fi
connectivity capacity of
a given area,
with a
given
infrastructure,
while
at
the
same
time
measure
the
infrastructures capability to position devices within that same
surveyed area.
Figure 1 – Infrastructures capacity to provide Wi-Fi Connectivity
This provides the capability to clearly map the capacity
of a currently installed infrastructure in any area within a
building to effectively locate a mobile device. Fig. 1
Infrastructures capacity to provide Wi-Fi Connectivity,
shows a sample area of the second floor of the West Wing of
LyIT Letterkenny Campus, illustrating the infrastructures
capacity to provide optimal connectivity to mobile devices
within a Wi-Fi network.
Fig. 2 Infrastructures capacity to locate, is a heat map of
the same area with precisely the same infrastructure but the
representation for coverage differs dramatically. Large areas
of the map cannot be used to adequately locate devices in
this area of the building. These images graphically depict the
challenges that designers face when attempting to implement
an
IPS
using
an
endogenous
infrastructure.
IPS
implementations can be classified as either exogenous or
endogenous, endogenous is made up of infrastructure that
has not been installed primarily for positioning reasons.
Whilst utilizing an existing infrastructure, such as this offers
many noble qualities, not least the reduced costs in procuring
equipment to implement an IPS solution, the problems are
obvious. Moreover, this emphasizes the hypothesis of this
research and the need for a solution like CAPTURE to
extend coverage into un-locatable areas of a network.

These blind spots are illustrated in the black areas in Fig.
2 Infrastructures capacity to locate, the green areas are areas
where the endogenous infrastructure can adequately locate
devices. Cooperative devices within the CAPTURE system
that were at the edges of these green areas would already be
located with the current IPS. These cooperative devices can

these
areas
without
coverage,

locating devices within that area, thereby extending the reach
of the IPS.

CAPTURE
The hypothesis of this research is that mobile devices at
the boundaries of IPSs, who have themselves been located
by an IPS, can assist in a cooperative approach to locate
mobile devices beyond the range of the IPS but within range
of the cooperating devices. CAPTURE attempts to prove this
hypothesis in an augmented approach, using the Received
Signal Strength (RSS) of both Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi radio
signals
to
ascertain
range.
A
fundamental
aspect
of
positioning and navigation in general, is the capacity to
measure range. Range can be defined as a measurement of
the distance between two points. One of the most popular
ranging techniques used in indoor localization, is RSS. RSS
is a measurement of the voltage that exists in a transmitted
radio signal, which is an indication of the power being
received by an antenna. When a signal first leaves a
transmitting device, the power of the signal drops or
attenuates,
this
is
true
of
both
wired
and
wireless
transmissions. As a radio signal propagates through the air,
some of its power is absorbed and the signal loses a specific
amount of its strength, therefore, the higher the RSS value
(or least negative in some devices), the stronger the signal.
Knowing the amount of signal loss over a given distance
provides
a
method
to
estimate
the
distance
from
a
transmitting device, given a RSS.
CAPTURE then uses this RSS range observable as input
for a positioning algorithm to determine the position of a lost
device. The algorithm requires at least three reference
devices to successfully position a ‘lost’ device within a
network. These devices must have ‘a prior’ knowledge of
their current position. That is, each of these devices have
already been located by an in-house indoor positioning
solution. During the tests Smartphones were used to position
the lost device. RSS readings, both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi,
were recorded from each device. The results of these tests
are detailed in the tables in Section IV.
IV.
RESULTS
The results of the experiments, which were carried out in
a large campaign of measurements taken in the main
campus area of Letterkenny Institute of Technology are
detailed in Table 1 and Table 2. The mobile reference
devices used in the tests to simulate the cooperative network
were Sony Xperia Z1 C6943 Smart Phones running Google
Android v5.1 (Lollipop) on a Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400
CPU. Authors in [9][10] describe problems with varied RSS
readings when using different phones, which most likely use
different antennas. They describe the difference being up to
11.2 dBm when using disparate antenna in 25 meter tests.
Lisheng et al, and Kaemarungsi and Krishnamurthy both
describe these issues when testing using Wi-Fi, but because
Bluetooth operates somewhat
similar to Wi-Fi, it is
expected that similar effects would happen with these
readings when using different antenna types. Rappaport [1]
also highlights issues with device orientation, which was
also considered during the tests. All tests were carried out in
a Line of Sight (LoS) environment offering a clear view of
all phones during the tests. The average position error
ranges from 0.16 meters to 65.14 meters when using Wi-Fi.

CAPTURE RANGE
Another important question this research posed was just
how far could CAPTURE extend an IPS? Hypothetically
speaking, there is nothing to stop a device that has been
located using CAPTURE, to in turn cooperatively assist in
the location of devices beyond the devices that located it but
within its range. With the errors rates that are currently being
recorded,
this
would
seem
problematic,
especially
considering the error propagation that would occur with each
hop. Again, hypothetically speaking, it is still plausible
within the scope of the CAPTURE framework. It is accurate
to say however, that any positioning system, that uses range
to position, is constrained in coverage, primarily by the
technology
employed
to
measure
range.
The
current
implementation of CAPTURE uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to
estimate range, each of which have theoretical boundaries of
200
meters.
In
experiments
implemented
in
the
test
environment
described
previously,
to
establish
the
limitations of CAPTURE, RSS values were recorded for
Bluetooth at a range of 173 meters and Wi-Fi at a range of
175 meters. These experiments were carried out in a LoS
environment, which would reduce dramatically in a Non-
LoS situation. Furthermore, the evaluated range using the
recorded RSS values in these tests was 137.56 for the
Bluetooth
173-meter
test
–
a
35.44-meter
average
positioning error and 129.45 meters for the Wi-Fi 175-meter
test – a 45.55-meter average positioning error. Although
these error bounds are very high, it still nonetheless proves
the fact that CAPTURE can extend into those areas by that
distance. Considering the nomadic nature and resource
limitations
of
the
collaborative
devices
employed
to
implement CAPTURE, it would be nigh on impossible to
equal the accuracy levels achieved by custom designed
IPS’s. But then, without CAPTURE these devices would not
be found at all.
Although
the
error
bounds
found
using
this
implementation are very high, the concept of CAPTURE is
still nonetheless proven. That is, that a mobile device that
can see another mobile device, can help in positioning it.
Without CAPTURE in the test scenarios described, the lost
devices would never be found. To just be able to say that
these devices that cannot currently be seen by the in-house
IPS can be seen when using CAPTURE, albeit with a high
error bounds is still noteworthy. If the lost device was a
wheelchair in a hospital, or a passenger in an airport, that a
LBS used the IPS to find, it could, conceivable, be anywhere
in the world. Using CAPTURE, it could be located within a
certain vicinity, providing a coarse position estimate. It is not
perceived that CAPTURE would be used in scenarios
whereby accuracy levels were required to be within a
number of feet. Nor was it ever argued that CAPTURE
would be able to offer the accuracy levels that an IPS could
offer with its custom designed and powerful infrastructure.
But it is the authors’ opinion that CAPTURE has a role and
that it can fulfill that role, to allow IPS’s to use mobile
devices to cooperatively extend their range.
VI.
CONCLUSION
The motivation behind the development of CAPTURE
was to provide a technique to provide better coverage for
Indoor Positioning Systems. The live tests carried out to date
on CAPTURE prove that it is in fact possible and that the
use of cooperating devices is key to this. The accuracy levels
of CAPTURE in its current manifestation makes it unviable
currently as a solution. More work is required in the area of
filtering of data to remove errors and outliers as well as
looking at other technologies to
enhance the current
implementation.
Round
Trip
Time
(RTT),
could
be
integrated with the current version of CAPTURE to offer
more accurate position estimates. Most implementation of
position solutions use a hybrid of solutions to solve the
positioning problem. It would be considered common
practice today to use a combination of ranging techniques in
a hybrid solution, in most situations to establish a more
accurate ranging estimate. It is hoped that a future version of
CAPTURE could incorporate such a hybrid or augmented
approach.
