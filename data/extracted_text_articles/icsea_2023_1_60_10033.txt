Abstract: Heritage 3D digitization is a research topic 
undertaken by a broad community of scientists and policy 
makers. One of the technological solutions chosen is Faro 
Focus laser scanners. 3D digitization is carried out according 
to a unified procedure using device-dedicated software. The 
sequential nature of this procedure and the features of the 
dedicated software prevent the full potential of the supported 
hardware from being used. Optimization is possible at the 
stage of process allocation for many digitization tasks. We 
propose a software pipeline and its simple optimization that 
allows at least some of these challenges to be overcome. 
Validation was performed on 3D scans of three Romanian 
wooden churches. The proposed approach allowed the 
production of high-quality 3D models. Optimization, despite 
simplicity, showed a noteworthy effect in the case of processing 
3D scans of a number of objects. 
Keywords: software pipeline; 3D digitization; heritage; Faro 
Focus; 3D laser scanner; wooden church. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Heritage 3D digitization is an emerging topic of current 
research [1]. We can observe efforts in terms of technology 
and heritage protection protocols in a variety of domains, 
including architecture [2], clothing [3][4], and small–
medium sized objects [5], as well as intangible heritage [6]. 
Archiving [7], reconstruction [8], and dissemination [9][10] 
are considered as the typical goals of digitization. 
Among technologies used, laser scanning emerged as the 
default technology used in the case of architecture [7][11]. 
One of the frequently used solutions is Faro Focus 3D laser 
scanner. As a result of the scanning, point clouds are 
produced. Then, they are transformed to a base 3D model, of 
reasonably high quality, that might undergo certain 
simplifications for the purpose of its dissemination. 
We, based on our long-term experience and literature 
survey, see some important software challenges that occur 
during the transformation from point clouds from Faro Focus 
scanner to 3D models. The following can be mentioned 
[2][7]: 
 
Equipment performance – the time of data 
processing might be long (even days in the case of 
very large 3D models). Sometimes some of the data 
processing steps have to be repeated to obtain a 
result of proper quality. 
 
Software interoperability – in order to obtain a 3D 
model of a proper quality, many programs from 
different vendors have to be used. This causes the 
need for exporting/importing data in a compatible 
format, which also takes significant time. 
 
Workflow parallelization – in order to speed up data 
processing, some of the steps should be able to be 
executed in parallel. Usually the disk drive, 
processor and memory are not evenly and fully used 
during the sequential execution of the steps.  
 
Missing common software pipeline – due to the 
heavy and long computations, a proven and stable 
set of software tools is desired. 
 
Software pipeline dependent on requirements for the 
final 3D model – 3D models for the purpose of 
documentation focus on quality and precision, while 
dissemination 3D models focus on the presentation 
issues and performance of target devices. 
This work presents a software pipeline that fits the 
specificity of a Faro Focus 3D scanner. Some basic 
optimizations are also discussed and preliminarily verified. 
The real-life case studies of wooden churches from Romania 
were chosen. We believe that this work might be valuable for 
readers in terms of identifying important challenges, 
describing the software gap that needs amelioration and 
automation, and providing a suggestion of what to do until 
better software appears. Persons involved in the hot topic of 
3D heritage digitization can learn of a proven set of tools that 
could be applied during their activities. 
In Section II, related works are investigated. In Section 
III, the proposed approach is introduced. In Section IV, 
materials and methods are described. In Section V, results 
regarding real-life examples, being three wooden churches, 
are discussed. Finally, in Section VI, conclusions are drawn.

RELATED WORK 
Faro Laser scanners have a broad range of applications: they 
are used to scan the interiors [11][12] and exteriors [13][14] 
of buildings, as well as sculpture-size objects [15][16], or 
even petroglyphs [17][18]. Authors of previous works 
highlight the specificity of the laser light, which makes it 
suitable for outdoor conditions as well as for dealing well 
with large-sized objects (even above one hundred meters). 
It was also revealed that there is no common pipeline 
used. Authors employed a custom and differentiated set of 
software tools. Sometimes sets of tools were the same, 
although they were used to perform different data processing

steps. Among others, the following pipelines are worth 
highlighting: 
 
Faro Scene for point clouds manipulation; then 
Autodesk Recap Pro for registration, denoising and 
decimation; finally MeshLab for 3D meshing [15]. 
 
Faro Scene for point clouds manipulation; then 
Autodesk Recap Pro for denoising and remaining 
activities [11]. 
 
Faro Scene for point clouds manipulation; then 
Geomagic Studio for remaining activities [17]. 
 
Faro Scene for all the computation steps [18]. 
Finally, 3D data processing steps were usually not 
optimized. Execution was kept sequential. The topic of 
parallelization was omitted. Some authors have mentioned 
optimizations

characteristics, either in terms of the hardware acceleration 
of a single step, such as by utilizing graphical processing unit 
computing capabilities or running data computation on 
dedicated highly efficient machines. Works dealing with the 
topic of processing 3D scans of heritage objects made using 
Faro Focus 3D scanner in the same way as ours were not 
identified. 
III. 
PROPOSED APPROACH 
In order to properly present our idea for the software pipeline 
designed for Faro Focus scans, some introduction is needed 
first. The purpose of using the pipeline is to obtain a textured 
3D model of high quality (so called base model), that is 
based on clouds of points from 3D scanning (so called 
scans). To achieve this goal the following software tasks 
(data processing steps) have to be performed: (1) opening 
and colorization of individual scans, (2) registration of scans 
in relation to each other, (3) scans cleaning, (4) generation of 
a 3D mesh based on scans, (5) mesh texturing, (6) export of 
the final model. 
Software. We recommend using the following two 
proven software tools within the pipeline: first Faro Scene 
[19] and next Reality Capture [20]. Faro Scene is the 
dedicated software provided together with a Faro Focus 3D 
scanner. In our opinion, it is well suited for tasks one to 
three, i.e., operation on clouds of points. Reality Capture is 
third-party software well suited for tasks four to six, i.e., 3D 
model generation and texturing. 
Faro Scene has some significant disadvantages, being: 
3D model size limits, making Faro Scene useless in the case 
of large objects, like buildings; significant loss of 3D model 
quality due to the necessity of simplifications; unsatisfactory 
3D model generation capabilities. Thus, it is supplemented 
with Reality Capture, which provides very rich functionality 
and interface, as well as capabilities for computing extremely 
large 3D models (even exceeding the largest ones that could 
be displayed by contemporary computers). 
Unfortunately, the presence of two software tools within 
the pipeline, although necessary, introduces some overhead 
related to passing scans in a proper format from one tool to 
the other. Thus, two additional steps occur between steps 
three and four, i.e., data export from Faro Scene to the so-
called “ordered format” and data import to Reality Capture. 
Finally, software tools proposed by us might be 
perceived as comparable in terms of functionality with some 
tools identified during the literature review. Nevertheless, the 
proposal’s superiority lies mainly in the use of tools offering 
the 
highest 
level 
of 
functionality 
and 
usability 
(independently of the 3D digitized objects’ size), and being a 
very affordable choice at the same time. Reality Capture 
licensing promotes in its way academic and non-profit usage. 
Optimization. Usually, the software tasks within the 
pipeline are executed sequentially, which causes computer 
resources to be partially and unevenly utilized. For example, 
some of the tasks heavily utilize a processor for a longer 
time, while disk and memory is idling.  
The above-mentioned mechanism creates room for 
performing some specific types of tasks in parallel, e.g., data 
export and data import or mesh model generation. Thus, we 
propose to perform in parallel the types of tasks that do not 
heavily utilize the same computer resources. This should 
noticeably speed up the time of processing, which is usually 
the scarcest resource. Three basic types of computer 
resources might be distinguished: processor, graphics, and 
storage.  
Software tools within the pipelines (not only within the 
one proposed by us) are basically not adjusted to the 
parallelization of software tasks done for one object. It is 
rather possible while executing many pipelines for many 
objects. The real-life example will be discussed in Section V, 
Results. 
IV. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The proposed approach was tested by us among others 
during the 3D digitization of wooden churches in Romania. 
Such choice was made to promote our recent activities. The 
scans of facades of the following churches were used for the 
purpose of this work: 
 
(C1) The orthodox church of Creaca: 13 scans – 
10,338 x 4,267 pt. 
 
(C2) The orthodox church of Târgușor: 10 scans – 
10,342 x 4,267 pt. 
 
(C3) The orthodox church of Petrindu in the open-air 
museum of Cluj-Napoca: 15 scans – 10,172 x 4,267 
pt. 
They all represent a similar class of heritage object, in 
terms of size, building materials, and shape complexity. Due 
to space constraints, their further description is omitted. To 
see short notes describing the churches, as well as models 
and panoramas, please refer to [21], which is a web page 
reporting works on the digitization of the wooden heritage of 
the Carpathians. This, along with the works themselves, is 
run as an internal initiative by the Department of Computer 
Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science of the Lublin University of Technology. 
All computations were performed on a laptop computer 
equipped with: Intel i9 processor (8 cores), 64 GB RAM, 
nVidia RTX 2080m graphics, SSD M2 data storage drive, 
and Windows 11 operating system. We took care of equal 
conditions for each measured computation unit.

The procedure was as follows: the eight software tasks 
defined in Section III were executed sequentially for scans of 
the three chosen wooden churches. During the execution the 
following was measured: operator engagement; processor, 
graphics and storage load; task execution times. Based on the 
measured computer resources loads, optimization by 
parallelization was planned. Then, the software tasks were 
run again, but utilizing the planned optimization. The same 
measurements were performed. All computations were 
assisted by the same 3D digitization expert. The execution of 
each task for each church was repeated three times and 
measurements’ average values were counted. 
The operator engagement can be defined as a percentage 
of a total task time that involved manual actions of a human. 
It was described in the following scale: L (low – only up to 
30% of task time), M (medium – from 31% to 70% of task 
time), H (high – more than 71% of task time). Computer 
resources loads were described using a similar scale, where L 
means an average load of up to 30%, M means an average 
load of between 31% and 70%, and H means an average load 
of above 71%. Task execution times were measured with a 
precision of 6 minutes (0.1 h), which was sufficient due to 
the many manual human activities involved, long overall 
time of computations, and general character of the 
evaluation. 
V. 
RESULTS 
Table I presents the validation results of our approach 
according to the procedure described in Section IV. In Table 
I, the column “Task name” contains the software tasks, in a 
proper order, leading from clouds of points to a 3D model. 
The column heading “Op. eng.” stands for operator 
engagement. “Comp. type” stands for computation type, 
while the “seq” row holds values for the sequential execution 
of the task, and “par” holds values for the parallelized 
(optimized) execution of the task. “CPU” stands for the 
processor, “GPU” for the graphics, and “SDD” for the disk 
drive (storage). “C1”, “C2”, and “C3” stand for the models 
of churches 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Finally, “Exec. time” 
means execution time. 
Thus, for example, regarding software task 1: The task, 
when executed sequentially (“seq” row), caused low (“L”) 
operator engagement, medium (“M”) load of CPU, low (“L”) 
load of GPU, and medium (“M”) load of disk drive. 
Execution of the task 1, when sequential, took 1 h 30 min in 
the case of church 1 (“C1”), 1 h 18 min – church 2 (“C2”), 
and 2 h 0 min – church 3 (“C3”). The “par” row holds values 
for the same single software task, but executed in the 
parallelized setting. It means, the measured values also refer 
to that single task. The times (similarly other values) might 
be almost the same or slightly different, because 
parallelization causes heavier usage of the computer 
resources, which might slightly slow down the execution of 
particular tasks, despite a shorter overall computation time 
being needed to obtain all 3D models of the churches. 
After analyzing the measurements taken during the 
sequential execution of the tasks, the possible parallelized 
setting was developed. It took into account the preservation 
of the order of the tasks necessary when obtaining a 3D 
model from scans for a single heritage object. The optimized 
pipeline looked as follows: (1) Tasks 1–3 for the model of 
“C1”. (2) In parallel, task 4 for the model of “C1” and tasks 
1–3 for the models of “C2” and “C3”. (3) In parallel, task 4 
for the model of “C2” and tasks 5–6 for the model of “C1”. 
(4) In parallel, task 4 for the model of “C3” and tasks 5–6 for 
the model of “C2”, followed by task 7 for the model of “C1”. 
Subsequent tasks for the models were carried out 
sequentially.  
“*” denotes low operator engagement, because such 
scans were chosen that could be registered automatically by 
a software tool. “**” denotes a surprising property of Faro 
Scene, that export takes a lot of time yet does not heavily 
utilize the computer resources.

It can be seen in Table 1 that when execution is 
sequential, the computer is fully focused on one task only, 
thus times are shorter. When another task is executed in 
parallel, the computer resources are already occupied by the 
first task, thus performance drop (longer times) cannot be 
avoided. The key result is that, when tasks are running in 
parallel, a longer time for the execution of a single task is in 
many instances observed, although the total time needed to 
process the data of all the 3D scanned objects is shorter.  
Finally, the sequential execution of the tasks, in order to 
get final 3D models of all three churches exported to OBJ 
file format, took 54 h 45 min. After the parallelization, 
achieving the same goal took 42 h 15 min. The resulting 
models can be found at a dedicated web page [21].

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In order to overcome challenges of postprocessing Faro 
Focus 3D scans, we proposed our own software pipeline 
(utilizing Faro Scene and Reality Capture tools), together 
with a simple optimization by parallelization of performed 
tasks. It was then verified on the example of three Romanian 
wooden churches. What is more, we have used it for a longer 
time during our digitization works involving Faro Focus 
scanners. 
In our opinion, the pipeline proved itself useful. Among 
the main advantages is its being affordable, while offering 
functionality and quality at the highest level. Moreover, it 
does not heavily engage the operator. The proposed 
optimization allowed us to decrease noticeably the total time 
of acquiring all 3D models of many objects from scans. In 
the case of the scans here used, it was reduced by ~1/5, 
despite a slightly longer execution time being seen for 
particular tasks due to the heavier (better, fuller) usage of the 
computer resources. It was also revealed that optimization 
did not heavily affect the computer resources loads when 
they were observed separately for each particular single task 
done for a particular single model.  
As a disadvantage, the use of two software tools might be 
mentioned. It requires an operator to learn how to use two 
different tools. Moreover, the list of tasks has to be extended 
by the resource-consuming export and import of data. 
Unfortunately, there is no other way, when it comes to 
obtaining high-quality models of large objects, due to Faro 
Scene’s limitations. Finally, it is possible in rare cases that 
very heavy tasks may cause full usage of a particular 
computer resource, making parallelization barely possible.
