Abstract—This paper discusses how citizens can play the role of 
sensors, using their perceptions to discover and report problems 
using some kind of digital platform. The use of human sensors 
is connected to the concept of “smart cities”. After a literature 
review, the paper presents two platforms and their use in detail: 
“FixMyStreet” and “Sauberes Wiesbaden”. The two case 
examples are used to discuss the concept of human sensors in 
further detail. The paper concludes with proposals for further 
research on the topic presented. 
Keywords-citizens as sensors; human sensors, fixmystreet, 
Sauberes Wiesbaden, smart cities. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Research on electronic participation has mainly focused 
on political participation as some form of discourse- and text-
based deliberation [1]. But citizens may participate in other 
capacities, as experts (sharing their competence) and as 
volunteers (sharing their time) or both. 
This paper focuses on citizens as sensors. Citizens collect 
data using their own senses and make an action to report their 
observations, but they can also be sensor platforms by 
carrying sensors around. We define a “human sensor” as a 
citizen that helps collect data about his/her surroundings. 
Citizens may also collect data about themselves, such as 
health condition data, sleep pattern data, or physical activity 
data, but such activities are outside the scope of this paper. 
The concept of “citizens as sensors” is closely connected 
to crowdsourcing and crowdsensing. Crowdsourcing implies 
that a (large) crowd works on solving a problem, while 
crowdsensing focus on observations made by a (large) crowd. 
Citizen observatories are projects where citizens observe and 
report. This paper focuses on the sensor activities of the 
individual, not as a larger crowd. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
presents results of a literature review on citizens as sensors. 
Section III uses two specific case examples to show how 
human sensors can be supported by digital platforms. Section 
IV discusses the findings, while Section V provides the 
conclusions and plans for future work.  
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
The main inspiration for our research on “human sensors” 
came from Villatoro and Nin [2]. The authors presented a 
vision of citizen sensor networks based on two different 
scenarios: Tracking citizens as passive entities to understand 
and optimize smart city functions, and citizens as active 
entities motivated by their common sense and using their 
mobile device to communicate the sensed sample. 
Berntzen and Johannessen [3] introduced “citizens as 
sensors” as part of a discussion on the role of citizens in the 
smart city. This paper focused on political participation, but 
also discussed other possible roles, such as “human sensors”. 
Gil, Cortés-Cediel and Cantador [4] also discussed various 
forms of citizen participation in smart cities, including 
examples where citizens collect data to inform their 
government. They use FixMyStreet as one of their examples. 
A search for literature on projects relying on data collected 
from citizens provided examples from public transport, smart 
parking, air quality monitoring, waste reporting, urban 
planning and development, and crisis/emergency response. 
The following subsections provide insight into how citizens 
act as sensors. 
A. Public Transport 
Holleis et al., described Tripzoom [5], an application 
implementing a new approach to urban mobility management 
and developed as part of the European FP7 project 
“Sustainable Social Network Services for Transport” 
(SUNSET)”. Citizens shared personal mobility patterns, 
optimized their mobility needs using recommendation and 
personalized traffic services from the city authority, shared 
travel-related information with buddies on social networks 
and got rewarded for sustainable behavior. The authors point 
out the opportunities for city authorities to obtain detailed 
mobility profiles of its citizens that can be used for assessment 
of current infrastructure use and future mobility needs. 
Optimal use can be encouraged by incentives. The Tripzoom 
app was tested in selected areas in Enschede (NL), 
Gothenburg (SE) and Leeds (UK) [6]. The Tripzoom app was 
offering the following value proposition to its users [6]: 
• 
Be informed. Tripzoom shows exactly how you travel. 
Where, when, how long and what it costs. Master your 
own travel behavior. 
• 
Be smart. Tripzoom gives you insight into the way you 
have traveled and helps with personal suggestions to 
make the right travel choices.

• 
Be rewarded. Tripzoom gives you rewards based on the 
way you travel. Take the challenge and be rewarded. 
Tripzoom is one example of how citizens act as sensors and 
also directly benefits from information produced by the 
submitted data. 
Tanas 
and 
Herrera-Joancomartí 
[7] 
proposed 
a 
smartphone sensing application Incidéncies 2.0, enabling 
users to notify and stay informed about incidents of the public 
rail network in the Barcelona metropolitan area. Their idea 
was to take advantage of the widespread use of smartphones 
combined with their sensing capabilities to gather sensory data 
from the environment and then send the sensed information 
back to a central data collection facility using cellular network 
technology. They suggested using the data retrieved from the 
application to analyze the potentials of new sensor network 
paradigm. 
In Southeast Norway, a consortium of private, academic 
and public partners developed a system for monitoring use of 
public transport. The Trafpoint [8][9] system provides real-
time information about passengers on buses. Some data is 
collected through cameras and motion detection algorithms. 
Public transport users can download an app. The app includes 
elements of gamification to reward users for using public 
transport [8]. The rewards can be shared on Facebook. The 
app also provides public transport planners with valuable 
information for changing bus routes and schedules. 
B. Smart Parking 
Koster, Koch, and Bazzan [10] developed “wePark”, an 
Android app for smart parking based on citizens observations. 
Citizens could report free parking spaces, and the app would 
direct drivers to a free spot. An earlier attempt by Google 
“Open Spot” used the same approach but failed. The authors 
proposed to use the app to investigate motivation for users to 
report free parking spaces. However, no follow-up study was 
found. 
C. Air Quality Monitoring 
Several projects have used human sensors to report on air 
quality. The Green Watch project [11] distributed 200 smart 
devices to citizens of Paris. The devices sensed ozone and 
noise levels as the citizens lived their normal lives, and the 
results were shared through a mapping engine. The project 
showed how a grassroot sensing network could reduce costs 
dramatically, and also engage citizens in environmental 
monitoring and regulation. 
I Trento, Italy, Leonardi, Cappellotto, Caraviello, Lepri, 
and Antonelli developed SecondNose [12], a mobile device to 
report air quality. The authors made the following 
observation: “Official authorities use to monitor and publish 
air quality data collected by networks of static measurement 
stations. However, this approach is often costly, hard to 
maintain and not scalable in the long term”. They also argued 
that fixed station provides “a lack of accuracy in the intra-
urban air pollution maps”. The device was distributed to 80 
persons in Trento. The initial use was high but declined over 
time. The authors explain: “Users said they were curious in 
the beginning, but soon learnt the characteristics of the places 
they measured”. This observation indicates potential 
limitations of using dedicated mobile devices for sensing the 
environment. 
Dutta, Chowdhury, Roy, Middya, and Gazi [13] made a 
similar approach by developing “AirSense”, a wearable unit 
to measure air quality. Again, the authors cited an inadequate 
number of fixed monitoring stations as the reason for 
implementing their project. 
The EU-funded project CITI-SENSE [14] also made a 
handheld sensor platform for air quality monitoring: “Little 
Environmental Observatory” (LEO). The project also 
developed a smartphone app to let citizens report on their 
perception of air quality. CITI-SENSE ran from 2012 to 2016. 
Ishigaki, Tanaka, Matsumoto, Pradana, and Maruo 
developed a mobile sensor to measure particle pollution. [15]. 
The sensor was tested in different cities in East Asia, partly by 
mobile sensing and partly by installing the sensor in fixed 
locations. 
A somewhat similar approach is used by AIRALERT, a 
service provided by CivicAlert, a Romanian NGO [16]. They 
use a handheld sensor platform “AirBeam” with Bluetooth 
connection to an Android smartphone. Volunteers collect 
data, and results are shown on a map. 
Pan, Yu, Miao, and Leung [17] used a different approach, 
by using smartphone cameras to detect air pollution through 
artificial intelligence techniques to determine particle 
pollution. This solution requires humans to do measurements 
actively.  
Migliore [18] developed a platform mounted on a bike, 
“SwarmBike”, to measure air pollution. The unit has a Global 
Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a GSM module to handle 
communication, and sensors for barometric pressure, 
temperature, humidity and a CO sensor. His thesis describes 
other types of sensors for measuring air quality. 
The problem with hand-held units is that someone must 
carry them around. Several solutions require Android 
smartphones. This requirement excludes a large number of 
Apple iPhone users. Users may also be reluctant to provide 
access through their own phones. It seems that most of the 
projects described above lasted for a limited period. 
D. Pollution and Waste Reporting 
The Irish Environmental Protection Agency has developed 
the app “See it? Say it!” to let citizens report on waste 
dumping/littering and other environmental issues [19]. A 
similar application has been piloted and tested in the city of 
Dhaka, Bangladesh [20]. Dhaka is a major city with 
challenges related to pollution (water, soil, noise, thermal, air) 
and waste dumping. The application was tested over a two-
week trial period and showed promising results. In Kinshasa, 
another pilot was developed and tested, also with promising 
results [21]. However, this pilot revealed some possible issues 
related to data quality and acceptance from government 
agencies who were reluctant to proceed with full-scale 
implementation. All three examples are similarly structured: 
They are based on geo-location, and users are asked to report 
on specific categories with the option to upload images and a 
text-based description. Pollution and waste reporting are also 
handled by our two case studies presented in the next section.

E. Urban planning and development 
In Norway, the Norwegian University of Science and 
Technology (NTNU) developed an Android app for The 
Norwegian Public Roads Administration to manage and 
monitor bicycle routes [22]. 
 City planners make assumptions about cyclists´ behavior 
based on insufficient data. The app provides more accurate 
information on which routes to improve based on feedback 
from cyclists. The app also provides information about such 
things as speed and relative frequency of use of bike lanes. 
Field testing was done in Trondheim, Norway, and at the end 
of the trial period more than 50 people had downloaded and 
installed the app and uploaded more than 100 trips. The 
collected data is visualized in a web-based interface and 
provides city planners with valuable information for planning 
purposes. 
In Turku, Finland, the city created a mobile app, Täsä, to 
let citizens participate in urban planning [23]. Citizens can 
download the app to report issues or present ideas for 
development. The app allows users to pin an issue to the map, 
take photos and upload text. It is also possible to discuss the 
proposals made by others. A first trial found that this engaged 
hundreds of citizens who used to app both to report on 
problems and present new ideas.  
     Goodchild 
[24] 
discussed 
the 
concept 
volunteer 
geographic information (VGI) and used case studies of 
OpenStreetMap, Flickr, and Wikimapia to show how citizens 
volunteering and contributing to GIS sites laid the foundation 
for other human sensor work such as FixMyStreet. 
     On the conceptual level, Resch, Summa, Sagl, Zeile, and 
Exner [25] proposed a system using human sensors to capture 
citizen perception of public places. They model a combination 
of geolocation, wristband sensor to measure “emotion” and 
social media mining to aggregate data on citizens’ attitudes, 
emotions, and perceptions of public places. The results can be 
used in planning processes of new areas, or as input for 
regulating and changing existing places. 
F. Crisis/emergency response 
Several authors discuss how crowdsourcing of data using 
human sensors can be valuable for crisis management and 
emergency response. According to Liu [26], the 2010 Haiti 
earthquake was the first-time researchers became aware of the 
potential of citizens crowdsourcing information. Based on 
experiences from Haiti, they have designed a framework for 
spontaneous crowdsourcing in emergency and disaster areas.   
     Kamel Boulous et al. [27] did a review of applications and 
use cases for citizens as sensors, and mentioned areas such as 
fire prevention, medical information, routing of CPR-trained 
personnel to emergencies, drug safety and disease outbreak 
mapping as examples. They also present GIS-based tools that 
can be applied to create other applications 
     In Brazil, Degrossi, de Albuquerque, Fava, and 
Mendiondo [28] described a pilot study on how human 
sensors can contribute data related to flooding, a significant 
problem in parts of the country. Evaluation of the case 
showed that this had significant positive impact on flooding 
data in the areas where the pilot study was conducted. 
III. 
CASE EXAMPLES AND FINDINGS 
Two case examples are used to illustrate how human 
sensors use platforms for reporting their observations. The 
first case is the Norwegian version of FixMyStreet: 
FiksGataMi. This version was developed and is maintained by 
the Norwegian Unix User Group. The second case is 
“Sauberes Wiesbaden”, a mobile app developed in 
cooperation with the municipal waste services operator ELW 
and the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences in 
Wiesbaden, Germany. The two cases were selected based on 
the availability of data for analysis. 
A. FixMyStreet (FiksGataMi) 
This subsection presents our study of the Norwegian 
version of FixMyStreet: FiksGataMi. FixMyStreet [29][30] is 
a web application allowing citizens to report issues and 
problems related to infrastructure and waste to local 
authorities. It was developed by mySociety, a British NGO 
with a mission to make citizens more powerful in the civic and 
democratic parts of their lives. The original FixMyStreet was 
launched in 2007. The application is location based. The user 
may pinpoint the location on a map. Typical problems are 
holes in the road, broken light bulbs in street lighting, 
abandoned vehicles, broken water pipes, etc. 
Figure 1 shows a screenshot of one of the reports, in this 
case about traffic signs. After reporting an issue, the report is 
sent to the relevant authorities through electronic mail. Both 
authorities and users can comment on reports, e.g., that the 
issue has been solved. It is also possible to see all reports 
within a geographical area. Figure 2 shows a map with several 
reported issues within an area. 
FixMyStreet is widely used in the United Kingdom, but 
the software itself is open source and has been adopted by 
cities, regions, and countries all over the world. When using 
the application citizens are acting as „human sensors“.

Our research aimed to find out more about the use of the 
application, including the number of reports, and the content 
of the reports. The information was extracted from the 
“FixGataMi” website by a custom-made web mining 
application, and extracted information was stored in a MySql 
database, and then grouped using SQL. The data for report

recipients and categories is from 2017. The reason is that new 
recipients among authorities have been added since its 
launch, in particular, the Norwegian Public Roads 
Administration regional offices. The sample from 2017 
consists of more than 6,000 reports from all over Norway. 
 
 
Figure 2.  FiksGataMi screenshot (geographical area). 
The use has been quite stable since its launch in 2011. The 
first year had more reports, probably because of novelty and 
press coverage. Table I shows the number of reports for each 
year. Each report has a unique id. The numbers are based on 
first and last registration each year. Some entries have been 
removed or are reported as unavailable. For 2017 this number 
is 376, which is close to 5 percent.

Table II shows the top ten recipients of reports. Not 
surprisingly, the regional offices of the public road 
administration are well represented together with the three 
largest cities (Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim). However, also 
some smaller cities (Hamar and Halden) are represented.

The developers of the Norwegian version added some 
extra categories not found in the English version to handle 
specific events relevant for Norway. These new categories are 
“oil spill”, “snow ploughing”, “bike roads”, “universal 
design” and “water supply”. “Universal design” is about 
reporting barriers for citizens with impairments. The list of 
categories is shown in Table III.

FixMyStreet is an appropriate name from the reports it 
contains. The three top categories are potholes (1,847), street 
lighting (1,820) and roads/highways (830). Also, most reports 
are sent to the Public Roads Administration. The categories 
unrelated to roads have fewer reports, but all categories, 
except Graffiti, was used in 2017. 
B. Sauberes Wiesbaden 
The 
project 
“Sauberes 
Wiesbaden 
App” 
(Clean 
Wiesbaden App) was initiated by the project office of the city 
mayor of Wiesbaden and the municipal waste services 
operator ELW. The project aimed to promote the participation 
of the citizens to quickly and easily report illegally dumped 
garbage and other waste disposal-related problems in the area 
of Wiesbaden, Germany. An app has been developed to make 
reporting easy and to supplement the existing, previously 
telephone-based channel for reporting waste dumping. The 
app uses the location data from the mobile phone to give the 
exact position of an issue. The mobile app concept was 
developed through research cooperation between the ELW 
14

SMART 2018 : The Seventh International Conference on Smart Cities, Systems, Devices and Technologies

 
 
and the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences in 
Wiesbaden [31]. 
The app was developed within about four months based on 
a user-centered design approach. Project members were 
employees of the IT department and the call center of ELW, 
the City Council, and the University RheinMain. The app was 
to be integrated into ELW's existing complaint management 
system initially developed for handling phone-based issues 
reported to a call center team via a hotline. An implementation 
approach based on a hybrid app (PhoneGap) was chosen to 
enable rapid development across different mobile operating 
system platforms (Android, iOS, Windows Phone). The 
mobile channel for the citizens could not be realized as a 
website or web app as the technical concept required access to 
the devices’ location and camera. Moreover, the app had to 
support notifications on status updates about the disposal 
removal. Implementation of this feature was challenging, as 
another requirement that emerged during the user analysis was 
the need for an option of reporting anonymously and without 
registration. 
After a basic requirement specification and up-front user 
research, a prototype of the app was developed rapidly and 
used for intensive pretesting. In particular, the localization of 
waste deposits turned out to be a demanding implementation 
task. GPS-based location information acquired by the users’ 
smartphones was often not precise enough, reverse geocoding 
failed (e.g., for green, wooded, or undeveloped areas) or 
additional information was required by the removal teams to 
accurately locate the issue. Anonymous reporting was 
intensively discussed as there was the threat that this could 
stimulate even more waste dumps or lead to unwanted or 
fraudulent use of the platform. For this reason, it was decided 
that all incoming reports are first checked by the ELW team 
and then approved for viewing on the map to prevent any 
misuse. A status map was integrated into the app and showed 
all approved reports and the corresponding removal status. All 
approved reports can be viewed on a status map. This avoids 
duplicate messages as a user can see on this map if a specific 
issue was reported before. Besides, problems reported by a 
user can be saved on the device in an “automated favorites” 
list by using an issue ID and then tracked for status changes in 
separate lists and views. Figure 3 shows the input mask for 
reporting issues and the status map with the reported issues. 
The mobile application was officially launched in the 
Google Play Store on October 9th, 2015. Versions for other 
mobile operating platforms followed some weeks later. The 
initial launch in the Google Play Store was accompanied by a 
press conference in the city hall and information about the new 
app on websites of ELW and the city of Wiesbaden, an article 
in an ELW customer magazine as well as articles in local and 
regional newspapers.  
During the first month, there were more than 1,000 
downloads. In this period 469 events were reported. From 
those, 13% were rejected due to duplicates, poor quality 
pictures, or because the report was located on a private or 
restricted area; while 87% were successfully processed. When 
comparing the app with other methods like calls or emails, the 
overall number of reports generated by the app has increased 
by 134% [31]. 
    
 
Figure 3.  Sample screens of the Sauberes Wiesbaden app. 
By the end of 2015, the number of downloads increased 
continuously. Figure 4 shows the installations of the Sauberes 
Wiesbaden App for Android and iOS. In May 2018 the total 
number of installs was 2,318 for Android and 315 for iOS. 
Statistics for uninstalls were only available for Android. 1,366 
uninstalls are reported for the app between September 2015 
and May 2018 in the Android Play Store statistics. 
 
 
Figure 4.  App installs per platform 2015-2018 
At the end of the year 2017, 2,154 active downloads were 
reported via the Android platform. This is a penetration rate 
of less than 1 percent with regard to the population of the city 
of Wiesbaden (2017: 290,547) [32] and still below 2 percent, 
when considering the smartphone penetration (2017: 54m 
smartphones [33], 82.7m inhabitants in Germany) [34] and the 
Android market share (for smartphone sales in 2017: 81.5 
percent) [35]. A large part of the downloads therefore already 
took place shortly after the launch. After that, there have been 
a continuous, but a low number of monthly downloads. This 
may be due to the fact that more comprehensive app 
marketing actions (e.g., AdWord or Facebook campaigns) 
have not yet been conducted. The distribution of the app is 
therefore strongly driven by references on the ELW websites, 
the app stores, as well as word-of-mouth communication and 
user recommendations. Nevertheless, including the test phase,

a total of 14,685 issues have been reported since May 2015 
(up to May 2018). Figure 5 shows that the number of reported 
cases is subject to strong monthly fluctuations and that there 
is no clear seasonal or long-term trend in the total number 
(app- and phone-based reports) of issues. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Reported cases 2015-2018. 
A similar fluctuation can be observed if only the app-based 
reported issues are considered. However, in Figure 6 a trend 
is apparent – the number of app-based reported issues has 
increased continuously over the last three years. 
 
 
Figure 6.  App-based reported cases 2015-2018 
(dashed line shows 3-point moving average). 
This trend becomes even more apparent when only the 
share of app-based messages in the total number of reported 
issues handled by the ELW is shown in Figure 7. The app-
share has already reached over 60 percent a short time after 
launch and has leveled off to around 80 percent in the last few 
months.  
 
Figure 7.  Share of app-based reported cases 2015-2018. 
Table IV shows the type of reported issues. Here, it can be 
seen that a large part of the issues is accounted for by (1) bulky 
waste, (2) general waste and (3) metal and devices. This seems 
plausible because this type of waste is the most noticeable in 
the cityscape.

Figure 8 clearly shows that the use of the app does not 
differ significantly in quality compared to the recording of 
issues by telephone. Since HY2017, however, the proportion 
of solved cases in telephone processing has been slightly 
higher. However, this is more likely related to procedural 
aspects and not to systematic problems in app-based issue 
reporting.

Figure 8.  Shares or solved cases (app and phone). 
As a result, it can be stated for this case study that the 
introduction of the Sauberes Wiesbaden App as an additional 
customer channel at ELW has been very successful. After the 
introduction of the app, the total number of reported and 
solved issues has steadily increased. The proportion of issues 
reported via the app –and thus automatically acquired 
feedback– has risen continuously. Since the app is available 
as a feedback channel for the population seven days a week 
and 24 hours a day, an attractive additional offer for the 
inhabitants of Wiesbaden has been established. It is interesting 
that the introduction has been successful even without 
comprehensive marketing initiatives. However, it can be 
assumed that the awareness and dissemination of the app can 
be further increased through appropriate campaigns. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that the 14,685 reported issues 
between May 2015 and May 2018 are related to only 2,633 
total downloads for the Android and iOS platforms. This 
corresponds to an average of more than five reported issues 
per download. In this respect, it can be assumed that apps are 
a promising instrument to achieve sustainable e-participation 
of citizens at a local level. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Smart cities use information and communication 
technology to improve performance and decision making. 
Data may be collected from various sources, e.g., sensors. 
This paper has examined a specific kind of sensor, the citizen 
as a sensor. Citizens can use their perceptions to report on 
issues. The city can use these reports to solve problems 
proactively. 
This paper examined two specific cases: The Norwegian 
version of FixMyStreet: FiksGataMi and the German app 
“Sauberes Wiesbaden”. Both applications have proved to be 
sustainable over time with a respectable number of reports. 
The two cases were selected based on the availability of data 
for analysis. We have shown the use and also what kind of 
reports citizens are making. Both cases provide a feedback 
mechanism to the people reporting issues, letting them know 
when the case has been resolved. This is likely important 
when it comes to retention rates and continued usage of the 
systems. 
The contribution of this paper is more insight into how 
citizens may act as sensors, and thereby contribute to solving 
problems in their communities. Smart cities are about 
increasing quality of life, provide better services, reduce 
environmental footprint and improve citizen participation. 
When citizens act as sensors, they contribute to all these aims 
of smart cities.  City services become more effective since the 
city is alerted to problems, including environmental issues. 
The citizens participate in improving the city and thereby the 
quality of life.to improve the city and thereby the quality of 
life. 
Possible future research may include further analysis of 
the data we have obtained, in particular, to correlate reports to 
time of year and time of day. Another possibility is to 
investigate the motivation among citizens that contribute as 
human sensors. We have currently not addressed security 
implications of this kind of reporting platforms. This could 
also be a topic for future research.  
Finally, our literature review of similar applications 
demonstrates several possible extensions to FiksGataMi and 
Sauberes Wiesbaden: Various forms of pollution, littering and 
waste dumping are perhaps the most relevant additions based 
on our literature review, as these are similar categories to the 
ones already found in the applications. Future research should 
examine possible enhancements of the two applications.
