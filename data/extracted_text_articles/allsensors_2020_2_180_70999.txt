Abstract—Due to the broad range of options that wireless 
systems offer, Wi-Fi products are increasingly being used in 
agriculture environments to improve farming practices and 
better control the output of the production. However, the 
foliage has proven to harm radio-frequency propagation as 
well as decreasing the coverage area of Wireless Sensor 
Networks 
(WSNs). 
Therefore, 
near-ground 
channel 
characterization can help in avoiding high antennas and 
vegetation. Nevertheless, theoretical models tend to fail when 
forecasting near-ground path losses. This paper aims at 
determining how the field components such as soil, grass and, 
trunks affect radio-links in near-ground scenarios. To do this, 
we measure the Received Signal Strength (RSSI), the Signal to 
Interference Ratio (SIR) and the Round-Trip Time (RTT) of a 
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), at different distances, 
and the results are compared with 3 prediction models: the 
Free-Space Propagation Model, Two-Ray Ground Reflection 
Model and, One-Slope Log-Normal Model. The experiment 
was carried out by collecting experimental data at two 
different locations, i.e., an orange tree plantation and a field 
without vegetation, taking measurements every meter. A 
comprehensive analysis of the influence of rural environments 
can help to obtain better near-ground WSN performance and 
coverage in precision agriculture.

INTRODUCTION 
Smart Farming (SF) emphasizes the use of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to leverage the 
farm management cycle. Improving the production capacity 
does not only enhance business efficiency but increases 
production and reduces the environmental impact. Since the 
United Nations expects the world population to reach 9.8 
billion by 2050, human societies are facing the challenge of 
providing nourishment and livelihoods, while addressing the 
effects of climate change [1]. As it is, smart farming applies 
measures 
ecologically 
meaningful 
and 
site-specific, 
focusing on implementing auto-piloted harvesters and other 
farm machinery to achieve the smartest treatment [2]. 
The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing are 
expected to move forward in farming management 
development by introducing these technologies into 
machinery and production systems [3]. The gathered 
information will then be sent via different technologies such 
as IEEE 802.11 standards, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, 
6LoWPAN, 3G, 4G, etc., depending on the amount of data 
to be transmitted and the distance [4]. Nevertheless, IoT 
systems usually deal with small amounts of data to be 
transmitted through short distances. The two main storage 
systems used to save the gathered information from the 
sensors are traditional databases or clouds. The most used 
databases are MySQL and SQL, while the Thingspeak 
platform is the most used in cloud systems [4].  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are needed to 
monitor environmental conditions and provide decision-
making information. This type of networks is composed of a 
group of spatially dispersed sensors to monitor and record 
environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, 
soil moisture, etc. WSNs are made up of four parts: a 
wireless sensor node, a gateway node, a wireless 
communication network, and a server [5]. With the 
evolution of microelectronic technology, sensor nodes have 
evolved to be small devices with sensing, communication 
and computing devices. However, each node can only 
monitor a specific part of the field. Thus, the coverage area 
is a key problem since all nodes among a WSN must be 
autonomous to cooperatively pass data through the network 
to a main location. Moreover, its topology can vary 
enormously depending on the field. 
Whatever WSN application may be, IEEE 802.11 g/n 
standard is generally used in WSN because it allows 
distances up to approximately 300 meters in outdoor 
environments (when there is free space between devices) 
[5]. This allows a maximum raw data throughput of 54 
Mbps or 600 Mbps, depending on the standard used. 
Likewise, the radio-frequency band can vary from 2.4 GHz 
to 5 GHz using Modulation Code Keying (CCK), Direct-
sequence 
Spread 
Spectrum 
(DSSS) 
or 
Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation 
schemes.  
In 2019, Bacco et al. [7] conducted a survey on SF 
research activities to state the achieved results and current 
investigations within EU territory. As a result, challenges 
impeding the adoption of recent technologies and techniques 
were highlighted. Although the current use of sensor nodes 
and analytic techniques is boosting Decision Support 
Systems (DSSs) in farms the lack of diffusion programs is 
preventing areas affected by the digital divide from 
incorporating ICTs. Nevertheless, technology is expected to 
have an increasing role in agriculture so that operations, 
such as planting and harvesting, may be automatized. 
Moreover, the availability of real-time data will allow finer 
control of pesticides and other chemicals. However, none of 
these will be possible without supporting policies to address 
poor telecommunication infrastructures and reduced digital 
skills. 
As for Precision Agriculture (PA), Lindblom et al. [8] 
conducted a review on agricultural DSSs within the frame of 
the ongoing Swedish project. This project intends to identify 
the scientific disciplines and other competences that need to

work together in developing technology for agricultural 
DSS. Therefore, the discussion is focused on the importance 
of considering in-land processes to design suitable WSNs. 
However, the lack of active participation in agricultural 
research and development processes is preventing the 
development of new practices and behaviours for more 
sustainable farming. 
This paper aims to study near-ground wireless coverage 
in rural environments to ease multi-hop routing design. To 
this end, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), the 
Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) and the Round-Trip Time 
(RTT) of a wireless signal were measured at an orange field. 
This study aims to determine how near-ground radio-links 
are affected by field components such as grass, soil, trunks, 
etc. In this experiment, measurements were made at two 
different scenarios: one without vegetation and one at an 
orange tree plantation. In both cases, we used an access 
point and a laptop to take measurements at different 
distances, 30 cm above the ground. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II 
presents some related works. In Section III, the most 
popular 
propagation 
models 
are 
explained. 
The 
methodology and materials used in the experiment are 
presented in Section IV. In Section V, the experimental 
results are analysed. Finally, the main conclusions and 
future work are exposed in Section VI.  
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
Few technical works characterize near-ground radio-
frequency propagation. In this section, some of the related 
works are discussed. 
In 2011, Lloret et al. [9] presented a WSN that uses 
image processing to detect bad leaves in vineyards and 
sends an alarm to the farmer. In this case, wireless 
communications are made through IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n 
standard to allow long-distance connections. Although the 
proposed system does not identify the cause of the 
deficiency, it detects bad leaves and notifies it to the farmer 
who can then decide what actions need to be taken. This 
solution provides a cost-effective sensor based on IP routers 
that have been adapted to fulfil this purpose. The designed 
WSN takes into account both sensing and radio coverage 
areas to allow low bandwidth consumption and higher 
scalability. The system to detect bad leaves goes through a 
5-stage process before the node decides whether an alarm 
needs to be sent. 
 In [10], Wang et al. depicted a statistical model for near-
ground channels based on experimental data collected 
through three different scenarios at 2.4 GHz. The main 
objective of this study was to develop a WSN to collect data 
in military explosive research. To do this, sensor nodes were 
fixed on the ground and had an antenna height of 3 cm to 
resist damages from detonations. Different propagation 
models were applied to predict path loss and compare the 
results with the performance of the obtained model. The 
main conclusion of this research was that antenna height 
determines the breakpoint distance of the nodes. 
Luciani et al. [11] described a study done on near-
ground node range at different heights in Wi-Fi crowded 
environments. The designed WSN used IEEE 802.15.4 
standard to avoid direct Wi-Fi interference. Signal quality 
and range were determined by collecting RSSI data of three 
nodes at increasing node separation distance until signal 
loss. To perform the tests, measures were taken at three 
different heights: 15 cm, 30 cm, and 100 cm, at three 
different scenarios. The results of this experiment showed 
that prediction models failed to accurately forecast path loss. 
Moreover, ground-loss proved to be a major issue that 
determines node range and thus, must be taken into account 
when designing WSNs.  
In 2015, Szajna et al. [12] characterized path loss and 
near-ground channels at 2.45 GHz on forested areas covered 
by snow. This study aimed to investigate the impact of 
antenna height and distance between nodes on path loss and 
special correlation. To do this, measurements were carried 
out in two different scenarios: a multi-purpose sports facility 
and a forested area covered by 15 cm of snow. In this case, 
antenna heights varied from 0 to 130.8 cm and the distance 
between the nodes varied in steps of 15.24 m and up to 79.2 
m. The analysis of the results showed that reducing antenna 
heights increased path loss and reduced spatial correlation. 
In [13], Torabi et al. proposed a near-ground prediction 
model to facilitate accurate WSN simulations using the 
principles of the Fresnel zones. In this study, the effects of 
antenna height, frequency, polarization, and electrical and 
geometrical properties of the terrain were studied. The 
accuracy of the proposed model was verified by comparing 
the theoretical results with near-ground measurements 
carried out in outdoor open areas. The results of this study 
showed that antenna height was by far the most influential 
parameter on network connectivity. Moreover, the wireless 
connection was proven to be fairly sensitive to the reflection 
coefficient in near-ground situations. 
Sangodoyin et al. [14] presented a near-ground channel 
model to achieve precision ranging and localization of 
ultrawideband 
(UWB) 
propagation 
channels. 
This 
experiment was performed using a self-built channel 
sounder with an arbitrary waveform generator and a high-
bandwidth sampling oscilloscope. In this case, antenna 
heights ranged from 10 cm up to 2 m above ground to 
determine its effects on signal strength. The results showed 
that the distance-dependent path loss was highly dependent 
on antenna heights. Moreover, under near-ground situations, 
frequency-dependent path loss exponent and shadowing 
variance increased.  
In 2017, Klaina et al. [15] presented a narrowband radio 
channel model operating under near-ground conditions [15]. 
To do this, a WSN based on ZigBee was designed to analyse 
the effects caused by soil and grass fields. In this case, radio 
communications were made at 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and, 5.8 
GHz. In order to estimate signal quality, RSSI was 
measured and compared to path loss. Finally, they 
concluded that the ground has no effects on RF propagation 
except in the cases where antenna heights were 40 cm or 
less. However, signal levels decreased in the presence of 
grass fields and soil. 
Tang et al. [16] studied a near-ground WSN at 470 MHz 
in four different scenarios to obtain the corresponding path 
loss models. To do this, measurements were taken on a flat 
concrete road, flat grass and two derived scenarios placing 
the transmitter directly on the ground. Three different 
antenna heights were used: 5 cm, 50 cm and, 1 m, and the 
RSSI was measured every meter at a distance up to 10 m, 
every 2 m at a distance of up to 20 m and every 5 m at a

distance of up to 50 m. The results showed that when 
antenna height is lower than 50 cm, prediction models tend 
to inaccurately forecast path loss and thus, network 
connectivity.  
After analysing previous works, we can conclude that 
near-ground wireless systems are difficult to characterize. In 
[9], the presented solution did manage to detect bad leaves. 
However, in this case, vegetation loss was not introduced 
into the power balance formula. The statistical model 
described in [10] demonstrated that antenna height 
determines coverage area and that propagation models fail 
to accurately forecast path loss. Moreover, the study 
depicted in [11] demonstrated that ground-loss is a major 
issue when determining node range. Nevertheless, this 
experiment was performed in Wi-Fi crowded environments. 
The study performed in [12] concluded that reducing 
antenna 
heights 
increased 
path 
loss, 
though 
this 
investigation was carried out in forested areas covered by 
snow. The research in [13] demonstrated that wireless 
connections were fairly sensitive to the reflection coefficient 
in near-ground situations. The experiment performed in [14] 
to characterize near-ground UWB propagation channels 
showed that the node range is highly dependent on antenna 
heights. Furthermore, the study carried in [15] to design a 
WSN based on ZigBee under near-ground conditions 
showed that grass fields and soil affect signal strength. 
Finally, in [16], a near-ground WSN where a transmitter 
was placed directly on the ground was presented, showing 
that prediction models fail to forecast path loss when 
antenna heights are lower than 50 cm. 
For the reasons stated above, in this work, we present a 
site-specific study to guarantee the performance of near-
ground radio-links in orange tree plantations. 
III. 
ANALYTICAL STUDY 
In this section, three propagation models are presented to 
predict the average signal strength drop and assess the level 
of accuracy that can be achieved in near-ground WSN 
scenarios. Thus, this section is divided into three different 
subsections. 
A. Free-Space Model  
The Free-space propagation model is the simplest way to 
calculate radio-signals propagation. From [17], we can 
extract the Free-Space propagation model based on Friis 
Transmission Formula. This equation is usually used when 
there are no obstacles in the line-of-sight, and it is given by 
equation (1). 
𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 = 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟𝜆𝜆2
(4𝜋𝜋)2𝑑𝑑2
 
(1) 
where: 
Pt: transmitter power, in watts. 
Gt: transmitter antenna gain. 
Gr: receiver antenna gain. 
λ: wavelength. 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
However, it is possible to calculate the losses between a 
transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) in terms of the 
frequency with equation (2). 
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 20 log 4𝜋𝜋 𝑑𝑑 𝑓𝑓
𝑐𝑐
− 𝐺𝐺𝑇𝑇 − 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅  
(2) 
where: 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
f: frequency in Hz. 
c: speed of light in the vacuum (meters per second). 
GT: transmitter antenna gain, in dBi. 
GR: receiver antenna gain, in dBi. 
B. Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model  
The Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model predicts path 
losses between a Tx and a Rx when they are both in line-of-
sight but have different antenna heights. This way, the 
received signal has two components: the line-of-sight 
component and the multipath component which is given by 
ground reflected waves. From [17], the given equation for 
the Two-Ray Model can be expressed by equation (3).  
𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 = 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟

(3) 
where: 
Pt: transmitter power, in watts. 
Gt: transmitter antenna gain. 
Gr: receiver antenna gain. 
ht: transmitter antenna height, in meters. 
hr: receiver antenna height, in meters. 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
Nevertheless, from the work in [16], we can tell that 
when radio-waves propagate near-ground in line-of-sight 
conditions, the path loss can be described by the plane-earth 
path loss formula, given by equation (4). 
𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 40 log 𝑑𝑑 − 20 log ℎ𝑟𝑟 − 20 log ℎ𝑡𝑡  
(4) 
where: 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
ht: transmitter antenna height, in meters. 
hr: receiver antenna height, in meters. 
C. One-Slope Log-Normal Model  
The log-distance path loss model is a statistical model 
that takes into consideration object blockage, environmental 
clutter, and other changes to predict path loss. From [17], 
the log-normal model can be described by equation (5). 
𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑 = 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑0 + 10𝑛𝑛 log

where: 
PL (d): path loss at distance d, in dB.

PL (d0): path loss, in dB, at reference distance of 1 meter 
(FSPL at 1 meter). 
n: path loss factor (n = 2). 
Xσ: zero mean Gaussian distributed variable with 
standard deviation σ. 
σ: linear regression of measured data. 
However, from reference [18] we can express One-Slope 
Log-Normal Model by equation (6). 
𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑑𝑑 = 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝑓𝑓, 1 𝑚𝑚 + 10𝑛𝑛 log
𝑑𝑑

(6) 
where: 
PL (d): path loss at distance d, in dB. 
FSPL (f, 1 m): free space path loss, in dB, at a reference 
distance of 1 meter. 
n: path loss factor (n = 2). 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
Other studies have determined that, when antenna 
heights are lower than 50 cm, the One-Slope Model tends to 
estimate path losses better than other models [16]. However, 
other researches state that the use of these theoretical 
models can lead to overestimations of the networking 
capacities and should be avoided [17]. In the following 
sections, we will compare these three models with collated 
data to evaluate their performance and verify their accuracy 
in near-ground scenarios. 
IV. SCENARIO DESCRIPTION AND TOOLS USED 
This section describes the devices used to perform the 
experiments, as well as the setup. Therefore, this section is 
segmented in four different subdivisions. 
A. Place of measurement 
In order to evaluate the path loss in near-ground radio 
wave signals, we sought out an orange tree plantation with 
an area of 1.775 m2, with a length and a width of 71 m by 25 
m, with no walls. 
B. Hardware used 
To perform this experiment, we used Linksys 
WRT320N-EZ router as a Tx configured to work at 2.4GHz 
with IEEE 802.11 b/g/n standard [19]. This router has three 
internal antennas with 1.5 dBi of antenna gain and an RF 
power of 17 dBm. The Rx was ASUS Gaming Notebook 
GL753V, which has a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7-7700 HQ 
processor, 16 GB of memory. Wireless connections are 
made with Intel Dual Band Wireless Wifi Bluetooth Card 
7265NGW that uses the IEEE 802.11 ac standard and has 
two antennas of 5 dBi of gain. 
C. Software used 
The measurements were made using the software 
Vistumbler [20] to scan the wireless network and measure 
both the SIR and the RSSI. As for the latency of the 
connection, it was measured by sending a ping signal 
through MS-DOS commands to the gateway. 
D. Set-up of the experiment 
Both Tx and Rx were positioned along the same line, 30 
cm above the floor to measure the SIR and the RSSI. The 
evaluation of the path loss of RF signals was made by taking 
measurements in two different scenarios. 
• Scenario 1: Measurements were made at an orange 
tree plantation, with data being collected every meter 
30 cm above the ground. 
• Scenario 2: Measurements were made on a field with 
no vegetation, collecting data every meter 30 cm 
above the ground. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the set-up of the experiment at the 
orange tree plantation. In order to be able to perform 
comparisons of the signal strength, measurements were 
made at the same distances in both scenarios. Fig. 2 shows 
the set-up in Scenario 1. The noise floor in both cases was 
80 dBm. Measurements were taken three times at each 
point. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section, the accuracy of the chosen prediction 
models will be verified by comparing them to near-ground 
measurements. First, the measured data will be examined 
and then prediction models will be discussed and compared 
to collated data. 
Fig. 3 shows the RSSI levels measured in the chosen 
scenarios. The RSSI from Scenario 1 fluctuates much more 
than the one from Scenario 2. This can be due to the random 
distribution of vegetation, as well as the presence of trunks. 
Moreover, the absorption of energy in Scenario 1 may be 
caused by the presence of grass. 
Fig. 4 shows the SIR measured in both scenarios. It can 
be inferred that the presence of vegetation has little effect on 
the quality of the signal, though the reflection on the ground 
may cause errors depending on the modulation used. 
Fig. 5 shows the RTT measured during the experiment. 
In this case, the time delays vary far more in Scenario 1 than 
in Scenario 2. This agrees with the observed fluctuations of 
RSSI in Scenario 1.  
In Fig. 6, One-Slope Model was plotted as a function of 
the logarithm of the distance, in meters. The accuracy of this 
model was validated by performing its trend line and the 
related R-squared value. As Fig. 6 shows, the trend line that 
best fits the plotted data has a linear tendency and an R-
squared value of 1. 
Finally, we compared the selected prediction models by 
plotting them together with the collected data from both 
scenarios in Fig. 7. In this figure, One-Slope Model overlaps 
Free-Space Model. Attending to the collected data curves, 
the path loss is higher in Scenario 1. However, the Two-ray 
Model 
failed 
to 
predict 
the 
attenuation 
correctly. 
Furthermore, the collected data from Scenario 2 shows a 
greater path loss than one the predicted by the Free-Space 
Model and the One-Slope Model.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we attempted to determine how near-
ground radio-waves are affected by field components such 
as grass, soil and, trunks. To this end, we performed an 
experiment at two different scenarios: one with vegetation 
and one without vegetation, where measurements were 
taken 30 cm above the ground. 
In this case study, we analysed the signal quality by 
measuring the RSSI, the SIR and the RTT of a wireless 
signal and compared the collated data with three different 
path loss prediction models. The results showed that, in 
near-ground scenarios, the RSSI tends to fluctuate much 
more in the presence of vegetation (Scenario 1). In other 
terms, the geometry of the trees and the presence of grass 
produced a scattering of energy, as well as a higher number 
of reflections and refractions. However, the interference was 
only noticeable from 15 m. As for the selected prediction 
models, none of them managed to accurately forecast the 
path loss, though Free-Space Model and One-Slope Model 
were close to the measured RSSI of Scenario 2. 
As future work, we would like to include in the 
experimental test different types of plantations agriculture 
environments such as vineyard [9]. Additionally, it could be 
interesting to perform these practical experiments with other 
technologies such as LoRa [21], Zigbee and Sigfox which 
are currently being used in farming activities and compare 
them with the results of IEEE 802.11 standard.
