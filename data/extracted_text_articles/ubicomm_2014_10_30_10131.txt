Abstract—In this paper, we propose an automatic modulation 
classification scheme for digitally modulated signals, such as 
MSK, GMSK, BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, and 
64-QAM. As features which characterize the modulation type, 
higher order cyclic cumulants up to eighth order of the signal 
are used. For feature classification, a Gaussian mixture model 
based algorithm is used. Simulation results are demonstrated 
to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under 
AWGN channels. 
Keywords- automatic modulation classification; Gaussian 
mixture model; cyclostationary; higher order cyclic cumulants.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a 
technique to identify the modulation type of the detected 
signal as well as to estimate the signal parameters such as 
carrier frequency and symbol rate, etc [1]. It is widely tried 
to apply in the field of military and civilian for electronic 
warfare, spectrum monitoring, surveillance, and cognitive 
and software defined radios.  
There have been many studies on AMC for last two 
decades. AMC schemes are normally classified into two 
major categories which are likelihood-based approach [2] 
and feature-based approach [3]-[10]. The likelihood-based 
method shows optimal performance in the sense that it 
maximizes the probability of correct classification. However, 
it has higher computational complexity for likelihood 
computation. In addition, it is highly sensitive to modeling 
mismatch such as timing, phase and frequency offsets, and 
noise variance. 
The feature-based approach attempts to extract a set of 
features from the received signal. Because the features 
represent a distinct pattern in a feature space, various pattern 
recognition algorithms can be applied for classification. 
Although this approach may not show optimal performance, 
it is easy to implement and shows nearly optimal 
performance when appropriate features and a classifier are 
combined.  
In [3], higher order statistics up to sixth order are used to 
discriminate binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature 
phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16-ary quadrature-amplitude 
modulation (16-QAM), and 64-QAM. As a classifier, a 
genetic programming combined with the K-nearest neighbor 
(KNN) algorithm is used. It shows good performance even in 
the presence of noise and frequency offset. In [4]-[6], 
cyclostationary statistics such as spectral correlation density 
[4] and cyclic cumulants (CCs) [5, 6] of the signal are used 
as features. These methods use a simple decision tree [4], the 
minimum distance metric [5], and the Mahalanobis distance 
metric [6] for classification. The classification performance 
is insensitive to model mismatch and independent of any a 
priori knowledge of signal parameters. In [7], a Gaussian 
mixture model (GMM) is used for classification of 
instantaneous amplitudes and phases of binary amplitude-
shift keying (BASK), binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), 
QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM signals and it shows better 
performance compared to [5, 6].  
In this paper, we propose a feature-based AMC scheme 
which uses CCs as features and the GMM for feature 
classification. We deal with both linear and nonlinear 
modulations, such as minimum-shift keying (MSK), 
Gaussian MSK (GMSK), BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 
32-QAM, and 64-QAM.  
This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we 
explain the signal model and entire framework of the 
proposed scheme. Brief review about CCs used for features 
is given in section III. The proposed AMC adopting GMM is 
explained in section IV. Simulation results are demonstrated 
in section V to evaluate the performance. Finally, the paper 
concludes in Section VI.

SYSTEM MODEL 
The proposed modulation classification scheme consists 
of two parts of a feature extraction block and a GMM 
classifier as shown in Fig. 1. Two signals, ( )
y n and ( )
r n  are 
entered to the first block. The received baseband signal ( )

The input ( )
r n  is the signal to generate the reference 
data for GMM, which has the same modulation type as ( )
y n  
with AWGN. The signal is required only for the learning 
process. 
At feature extraction stage, we extract the feature vector 
ˆ y
F  and the reference data matrix ˆM  from ( )
y n  and ( )
r n , 
respectively. Then, the GMM classifier is used to predict the 
modulation type

H  corresponding to the received signal. 
III. 
CYCLIC CUMULANTS (CCS) 
Most communication signals made by human represent 
cyclostationary characteristic, i.e., statistical properties of the 
signal are varying periodically with respect to time. Up to 
now, the CCs are widely used for AMC among many 
cyclostationary statistics of the signal. 
The k-th order with q-conjugate (k, q) CCs of 
( )
y n are 
defined as Fourier coefficients of time-varying k-th order 
cumulants [8] as follows

Since the CCs are just Fourier series coefficients of the 
cumulants as shown in (2), we can notice that the properties 
of the CCs follow those of the cumulants. Therefore, it is 
worth examining the properties of the cumulants. Some 
important properties of the cumulants are as follows [9]:  
 
 
If ( )
y n  is Gaussian random process, its cumulants 
higher than second order are zero.  
 
The cumulants of the sum of the independent 
random processes are equal to the sums of their 
cumulants.  
 
All odd-order cumulants are equal to zero when the 
distribution is symmetric. 
 
Cumulants higher than second order are called higher 
order cumulants. They characterize statistical amplitude 
features such as the shape of a signal regardless of Gaussian 
noise. Digitally modulated signal has its own distinctive 
pulse shape and amplitude distribution, therefore it shows 
different higher order CCs. On the other hand, the odd-order 
CCs are zero due its symmetric amplitude distribution. In 
this paper, we use higher even-order CCs such as fourth, 
sixth, and eighth order CCs as features to identify the 
modulation type. This is why the computational complexity 
greatly increases as the order of CC becomes higher.  
Fig. 2 represents the magnitudes of the various ( , )
k q  
CCs with the eight modulation signals. These values are 
calculated from (3) with 10 trials per each modulation type. 
In this figure, BPSK signal is omitted because its CC values 
are much greater than others. We notice that each 
modulation type has distinct values with different kinds of 
( , )
k q  CCs. In the case of high level modulation signal (e.g., 
QPSK and 8-PSK), the overlapping of fourth and sixth order 
CCs become to split in eighth order CCs. And, except (8, 0) 
and (8, 4) CCs, all CCs are nearly constant over SNR 
variation.

feature clusters corresponding to different modulation types 
and they are not overlapped each other. Since we utilize 
noisy signals for the reference data, each feature cluster 
reveals a probability distribution with mean as its center.  
Therefore, by using the probability distribution of the 
reference data, we can improve the performance of 
modulation classification.

PARAMETER ESTIMATE OF REFERENCE DATA 
 
As a performance measure for AMC, we use the 
probability of correct classification 
cP . To obtain the 
probability, 300 trials are performed in AWGN channels. 
Fig. 4 shows the performance with respect to the number 
of symbols of the received signal at SNR = 10 dB. The 
performance improves as the number of symbols increases.  
At low SNR, the bad classification performance of M-QAM 
deteriorates the whole performance of the scheme. Clusters 
of M-QAM are closely located in the feature space as shown 
in Fig. 3. Therefore, when the number of symbols is small, 
the variance of the feature vectors is large and results in bad 
classification of M-QAM signal. We observe that the 
probability of correct classification approximates one for the 
number of symbols larger than 3000. Therefore, we 
determine the number of received symbols as 4000 for the 
next experiments.

with the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and the 
minimum distance classifier of [5]. In [5], the eighth order 
cumulant with even number of conjugates is used as a 
feature. We observed that the performance of the proposed 
scheme is better than others over the entire range of SNR. 
When SNR is higher than 8 dB, the performance of the 
proposed scheme is nearly perfect. 
Fig. 6 shows the performance for the individual 
modulation signal in the same conditions as those of Fig. 5. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the probabilities of correct classification 
for all modulation types become 1 with SNR higher than 6 
dB. At lower SNR than 4 dB, the performance of the M-
QAM degrades abruptly because of the reason mentioned 
above. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed an feature-based automatic 
modulation 
classification 
scheme 
for 
eight 
digital 
modulation signals of MSK, GMSK, BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 
16-QAM, 32-QAM, and 64-QAM. We use the magnitude of 
fourth, sixth, and eighth order cyclic cumulants as features.  
To approximate the probability distribution of the features, 
the Gaussian mixture model is used. Based on the probability 
distribution, we identify the modulation type of the received 
signal according to the probability of its features. The 
simulation results show that the classification performance is 
much better as compared to the conventional K-nearest 
neighbor classifier and the minimum distance classifier.
