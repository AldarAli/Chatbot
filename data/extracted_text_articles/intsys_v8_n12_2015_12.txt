Abstract—This paper describes the application of a novel 
domain-independent 
decision 
support 
approach 
for 
Customer Satisfaction Research. It is based on customer 
satisfaction research through deep analysis of consumer 
reviews posted on the Internet in natural language. Artificial 
Intelligence techniques, such as web data extraction, 
sentiment analysis, aspect extraction, aspect-based sentiment 
analysis and data mining, are used for realization of 
consumer reviews analysis. In paper, specific Internet 
resources (such as yelp.com, tripadvisor.com, tophotels.ru) 
are used for accumulating customer reviews as a data 
source. This is performed in accordance with the quality 
standard ISO 10004 and proposed decision support 
approach, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative 
customer satisfaction surveys to be carried out. The output 
of the quantitative survey are values of customer satisfaction 
with product and each product’s aspect. The output of the 
qualitative survey are significance values of products aspect  
for customers and identified latent relations between overall 
satisfaction with product and satisfaction with products’ 
aspects. The proposed approach is performed as a prototype 
of a decision support system. To evaluate the efficacy of the 
proposed approach, two experiments on hotels and banks 
customer reviews have been carried out. The obtained 
results prove the efficacy of the proposed decision support 
approach for quality management and the concept of using 
it instead of classical methods of qualitative and quantitative 
research of customer satisfaction.  
Keywords-customer satisfaction research; decision support 
system; sentiment analysis; data mining. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
In order to provide product quality, a company should 
make effective managerial decisions. In the modern world, 
the efficacy of managerial decision-making process 
depends on the information available to the person that 
makes decisions and the depth of information analysis. 
Therefore, a company should develop processes of 
automated collection of information and its further 
processing and analysis. Decision-making should be based 
on the knowledge and principles obtained during the 
analysis of the collected data. In this article, we expand on 
our research work presented at The Third International 
Conference on Data Analytics (2014) [1]. 
Quality assurance is currently attained through a 
process approach based on the model of a quality 
management system [2] (see Figure 1). It describes the 
interaction of the company and the customer during the 
process of product production and consumption. To 
correct the parameters of a product’s quality in order to 
improve it for the customer, the model has feedback. For 
companies, feedback during the process of quality 
management is the information about the level of customer 
satisfaction, which is expressed in the form of customer 
reviews about a product’s quality. That is why customer 
satisfaction is key information for quality management that 
influences decision-making. 
 
Figure 1.  Model of a process based quality management system. 
To collect data and evaluate customer satisfaction, 
International Quality Standards ISO 10004 (International 
Organization for Standardization) recommends using the

following classical methods: face to face interviews, 
telephone interviews, discussion groups, mail surveys 
(postal questionnaires), on-line research and surveys 
(questionnaire surveys) [3]. However, these methods of 
collection and analysis of customer opinions have a 
number of significant drawbacks. 
A general drawback of these methods is a large amount 
of manual work: preparing questions, creating a 
respondent database, mailing questionnaires and collecting 
results, conducting a personal interview, and preparing a 
report.  All of these procedures make a research expensive. 
These methods cannot monitor customer satisfaction 
continuously. For this reason, monitoring is limited by a 
one-time period, because costs rapidly grow with an 
increase in the frequency of monitoring. There is no 
possibility for monitoring trends of customer satisfaction. 
It also has a negative influence on lengthiness of 
managerial decision making.  
Another problem regards various scales for measuring 
customer satisfaction and their subjectivity perception. 
Value of customer satisfaction is estimated by abstract 
satisfaction indices that are difficult to understand, hard to 
compare and interpret. Furthermore, methods for data 
analysis recommended by ISO 10004 [3] allow detection 
of only linear dependencies and relations in data, such as 
linear correlation. Using only linear methods researcher 
could miss the impact of the mutual satisfaction of the 
product's aspects to the overall satisfaction with a product. 
In paper, an aspect means characteristics, attributes, and 
properties that characterize the products, e.g., a “phone 
battery” or “delivery period”.  
The aim of this paper is the development of a decision 
support approach for quality management provided by 
analysis of customer reviews on the Internet with use of 
web data extraction, sentiment analysis, aspect extraction, 
aspect-based sentiment analysis and data mining that could 
overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of the classical 
approach for customer satisfaction research. The main 
contribution of our research is novel approach using 
results of sentiment analysis for further knowledge 
extraction about dependencies between overall satisfaction 
with product and product's aspects. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in 
Section II, we focused on overview of recent solutions and 
frameworks for analysis of user generated content and 
their drawbacks. In Section III, we described architecture 
and workflow of proposed decision support system. In 
Section IV, we described using text mining and data 
mining techniques for qualitative and quantitative 
customer satisfaction surveys. In Section V, we provide 
two experiments of customer satisfaction research: 1) 
qualitative and quantitative surveys for two hotels and 
whole resort and 2) qualitative survey for Russian banks.  
II. RELATED WORK 
Applying Text Mining tools for analyzing customers’ 
reviews posted on the Internet is not novel. There are 
many studies concerning models and methods for data 
collection, sentiment analysis and information extraction. 
Recent studies show acceptable accuracy of methods for 
sentiment classification. Gräbner et al. [4] proposed a 
system that performs the sentiment classification of 
customer reviews on hotels. The precision values are 84% 
for positive and 92% for negative reviews. Lexicon-based 
method [5] allowed the correct classification of reviews 
with a probability of about 90%. These achievements 
make sentiment analysis applicable for an application on 
quality management and customer satisfaction research. 
Jo and Oh [6] and Lu et al. [7] considered the problems 
of automatically discovering products’ aspects and 
sentiments estimation for these aspects, which are 
evaluated in reviews. For solving these problems, they 
suggested methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
[8] and its modifications. 
A lot of social monitoring systems and frameworks 
have been developed for automatic analysis of reviews and 
topics. Liu et al. [9] presented framework called Opinion 
Observer for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions 
of competing products. This prototype system is able to 
visualize the strengths and weaknesses of each product in 
terms of various product features. For visualization it use 
actual number of positive or negative opinions normalized 
with the maximal number of opinions on any feature of 
any product. For experiments, authors used reviews on 
electronic products. Kasper and Vela [10] presented a web 
based opinion mining system for hotel reviews and user 
comments that supports the hotel management called 
BESAHOT. The system is capable of detecting and 
retrieving reviews on the web, classifying and analyzing 
them, as well as generating comprehensive overviews of 
these comments. Ganu et al. [11] focused on an analysis of 
free-text reviews by means of classification of reviews at 
the sentence level, with respect to both the topic and the 
sentiment expressed in the sentences. For experiments, 
authors used reviews on restaurants. Blair-Goldensohn et 
al. [12] proposed a system that summarizes the sentiment 
of reviews for a local service, such as a restaurant or hotel. 
In particular, they focus on aspect-based summarization 
models, where a summary is built by extracting relevant 
aspects of a service, such as service or value, aggregating 
the sentiment per aspect, and selecting aspect-relevant text. 
Bjørkelund et al. [13] described how the results of 
sentiment analysis of textual reviews can be visualized 
using Google Maps, providing possibilities for users to 
easily detect good hotels and good areas to stay in. Ajmera 
et al. [14] developed a Social Customer Relationship 
Management (SCRM) system that mines conversations on 
social platforms to identify and prioritize those posts and 
messages that are relevant to enterprises. The system aims 
to empower an agent or a representative in an enterprise to 
monitor, track and respond to customer communication 
while also encouraging community participation. Bank 
[15] proposed interactive Social Media monitoring system 
to extract related information from user generated content. 
One of the important contribution of this work was the 
proposition of new quality indeces. One of the important 
contribution of work was proposition of new quality 
indeces. The Relevancy Index states the importance of a

given topic and provides a robust marketing and market 
penetration independent importance information. The 
Market Satisfaction Index provides the possibility to 
compare several product features among different products 
or manufacturers. The Product Satisfaction Index extracts 
the advantages and disadvantages of a product. 
In some related work, authors pay attention to relations 
between overall ratings of products, and ratings of 
products’ aspects evaluated in the review. Wang et al. [16] 
formulated a novel text mining problem called Latent 
Rating Analysis (LARA). LARA aims at analyzing 
opinions expressed in each review at the level of topical 
aspects to discover each individual reviewer's latent rating 
on each aspect as well as the relative importance weight on 
different aspects when forming the overall judgment. For 
solving this problem probabilistic rating regression model 
is used. For experiments, authors used reviews on hotels. 
De Albornoz et al. [17] aimed to predict the overall rating 
of a product review based on the user opinion about the 
different product features that are evaluated in the review. 
For experiments, authors used reviews on hotels. 
Wachsmuth et al. [18] formulated and validated an 
important hypothesis that the global sentiment score of a 
hotel review correlates with the ratio of positive and 
negative opinions in the review's text and that the global 
sentiment score of a hotel review correlates with the 
polarity of opinions on certain product features in the 
review's text. 
The main drawback of these considered systems is that 
they can provide entirely only a quantitative survey of 
customer reviews, i.e., they can provide measurement of 
the degree of customer satisfaction with a product and its 
aspects. Qualitative survey were usually only conducting 
the extraction of products’ aspects. However, estimation of 
the significance of each products’ aspects for the customer 
is missed.  The information about products’ aspects that 
influence customers’ satisfaction and relative importance 
of products’ aspects for the customers is missing, as well 
as an insight into customer expectations and perceptions. 
The most related work to this problem is [19]. It is 
dedicated to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to 
automatically identify important aspects of product from 
online consumer reviews. Most proposals used a 
probabilistic model with a large number of parameters that 
lead to low robustness of the model. Total weighting 
values of aspects are calculated as the average of the 
weighting values by each review. Finally, significance 
values of aspects are estimated independently of an 
opinion's sentiment, e.g., in real life, we can discuss in 
review about bad “signal connection”, but we usually omit 
comments in case of good “signal connection”, because it 
must be in phone. In our paper, we estimate significance 
values of aspects in accordance with their positive and 
negative sentiments. In this manner, it is possible to use 
the Kano’s model of customer satisfaction [20], which 
classifies customer preferences into four categories. 
In this paper, for qualitative survey is used a novel 
approach based on transformation results of sentiment 
analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis, such as 
sentiment labels of reviews and mentions about product’s 
aspects in reviews, into boolean data. After that, boolean 
data is processed with a data mining tool – decision tree 
(see Section IV). Qualitative survey aims to identify how 
the sentiment of reviews depends on the sentiment of 
different products’ aspects. In other words, how overall 
customer satisfaction with product depends on the 
customer satisfaction with a product’s aspects. Decision 
tree performs this aim and identifies latent relations 
between the sentiment of reviews and sentiment of a 
product’s aspects. Also using the decision tree allows to 
estimate the significance of product’s aspects for the 
customers. Output of qualitative survey are significance 
values of product’s aspects for customers and identified 
latent relations between satisfaction with product and 
satisfaction with each product’s aspect, which produced as 
rules extracted by the decision tree. The availability of 
both quantitative and qualitative surveys allows realizing 
Intelligent 
Decision 
Support 
System 
for 
Quality 
Management in accordance with quality standard ISO 
10004. 
III. THE PROPOSED DECISION SUPPORT APPROACH 
The suggested approach to decision making in product 
quality management accomplished through unification of 
methods for collecting and processing text data into 
Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS). The 
architecture (subsystems and contained modules) of the 
obtained IDSS is presented in Figure 2. The subsystem of 
monitoring and data collection fills the warehouse with 
customer reviews and other relevant information. It also 
supports the actuality of data via automated monitoring of 
Internet resources and carries out data cleansing. In the 
subsystem of monitoring and data collection is realized 
methods of web data extraction. The data storage 
subsystem provides safe-keeping and integrity of collected 
reviews and results of data processing. In the subsystem of 
data analysis are realized methods of aspect extraction, 
sentiment analysis of reviews, aspect-based sentiment 
analysis, and decision tree. In subsystem of user 
interaction is visualized results of analysis. 
In Figure 3, the algorithm of the IDSS is presented. It 
consists of four stages. The first stage includes collection 
of reviews from Internet resources, data cleansing and 
loading reviews into the database. IDSS is able to actualize 
data everyday and to correct current customer satisfaction 
that allows provide continuous monitoring. The second 
stage performs processing collected reviews. It includes 
preprocessing procedures, such as preparing training 
samples of reviews for sentiment classifier, text 
lemmatization, and encoding text of reviews in vector 
form. Processing procedures include extraction of a 
product’s aspects, training of the classifier and sentiment 
analysis of reviews and aspect-based sentiment analysis. 
The third stage is the quantitative survey. The 
quantitative survey is based on sentiment analysis of 
reviews entirely, and aspect-based sentiment analysis of 
sentences with mentions of a product’s aspects. Sentiment 
classification is attained through binary scale – positive

and negative sentiments. As a measure of the customer 
satisfaction with product is used a ratio of positive reviews 
to the sum of positive and negative reviews. As a measure 
of the customer satisfaction with product’s aspects is used 
a ratio of positive sentences with mentions of a product’s 
aspect to the sum of positive and negative sentences with 
mentions of a product’s aspect. The output of the 
quantitative survey is values of customer satisfaction with 
a product and each product’s aspect. 
 
Figure 2.  The architecture of Intelligent Decision Support System for 
product quality management. 
The fourth stage is the qualitative survey of customer 
satisfaction. It is based on transformation results of 
sentiment analysis into Boolean data and following 
constructing of decision tree on it. The qualitative survey 
aims to identify how sentiment of review depends on the 
sentiment of different aspects of a product. Decision tree 
performs this aim and identifies latent relations between 
sentiment of a review and sentiment of a product’s aspects. 
The output of the qualitative analysis is significance values 
of a product’s aspects for customers and identifying latent 
relations extracted by decision tree. Managerial decision 
development and making is carried out on the basis of the 
performed quantitative and qualitative surveys. 
IV. APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES  
In this section are described implemented AI 
techniques for customer satisfaction surveys and support 
decision making. 
A. Data collection 
Nowadays there are a large number of Internet 
resources where users can leave their opinions about 
products and services. The most popular examples of 
review sites are tophotels.ru (635 thousand reviews), 
yelp.com (53 million reviews), tripadvisor.com (130 
million reviews). Similar resources continue to gain 
popularity. As opposed to social networking services, the 
advantage of review sites lies in their purpose - 
accumulation of customer reviews. One more advantage is 
that many of such resources have moderators of reviews 
and confirmation of author's objectivity, e.g., registration 
procedure. 
 
Figure 3.  Working algorithm of Intelligent Decision Support System 
There are two main types of collecting data from the 
Internet resources of customer reviews: 1) by using API 
(Application Programming Interface), and 2) by web data 
extraction. API is a set of ready-to-use tools - classes, 
procedures, and functions - provided by the application 
(Internet resource) for using in an external software 
product. Unfortunately, only a few resources that 
accumulate reviews have API.  
In this paper is used the second method for data 
collection – web data extraction. It is a process of 
automated content collection from HTML-pages of any 
Internet resource using special programs or script. Related 
work is presented in [21][22]. Scheme of reviews 
collection is presented in Figure 4. Web pages of review 
sites have specific HTML-structure that includes separate 
blocks with the name of a product or company, author's 
review, and other blocks with additional information, such 
as date, place. Therefore, all reviews are clearly identified 
in relation to the object of review. It significantly 
simplifies the process of data collection in contrast to 
collecting messages from social networking services.

Input: review site 
1. Gathering links on pages with reviews or generating links by 
using a template. 
2. Setting boundaries for a content by using a HTML-structure. 
3. Collection data on the set of links. 
4. Cleaning data and removing duplicates. 
5. Loading data into the database. 
Output: set of customers’ reviews D 
Figure 4.  Algorithm of web data extraction 
B. Sentiment Analysis 
After data collection, it is possible to process review 
data with Text Mining tools. In this paper automatic 
sentiment analysis of reviews is used to evaluate 
customers’ satisfaction with product and product’s aspects. 
Sentiment stands for the emotional evaluation of author's 
opinion about a product that is referred to in the reviews. 
There are three main approaches to sentiment analysis: 
1) linguistic, 2) statistical, and 3) combined. The linguistic 
approach is based on using rules and vocabularies of 
emotionality words [23][24]. This approach is quite time-
consuming due to the need of compiling vocabularies, 
patterns, and making rules for identifying sentiments. 
However, the main drawback of this approach is the 
impossibility to get a quantitative evaluation of the 
sentiment. The statistical approach is based on the methods 
of supervised and non-supervised machine learning (ML) 
[25][26]. The combined approach presupposes a combined 
use of the first two approaches. 
In this paper we used methods of supervised machine 
learning – naïve Bayesian classifier and Support Vector 
Machines. Text sentiment evaluation can be expressed 
quantitatively. Their realization in IDSS is based on 
techniques   described by Pang and Lee [25][26]. More 
detailed information about implemented methods of 
sentiment analysis used in this paper can be found in our 
previous work [27][28]. In Figure 5 algorithms of learning 
and classification for naïve Bayes classifier based on 
Multinomial model are presented. An advantage of these 
ML methods that they are quite easy in software 
implementation, and do not require making linguistic 
analyzers or sentiment vocabularies. They are able to 
evaluate 
sentiment 
quantitatively. 
For 
sentiment 
classification is used binary scale - positive and negative 
tonality. We use vector representation of review texts with 
help of the bag-of-words model. As attributes, we consider 
bit vectors - presence or absence of the word in the review 
text, and frequency vectors – a number of times that a 
given word appears in the text of the review. 
Lemmatization is also used. We also used lemmatization 
that transforms all the words of the review to the initial 
form.

C. Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment Analysis of reviews allows the evaluation of 
overall customer’s satisfaction with product. However, it 
does not clearly show what customers like about a product 
and what they do not like. To answer this question, it is 
necessary to perform an aspect-based sentiment analysis. 
An aspect means characteristics, attributes, and properties 
that characterize the products, e.g., a “phone battery” or 
“delivery period”. However, one product can have a great 
number of aspects. Furthermore, aspects in the text can be 
expressed by words-synonyms, e.g., “battery” and 
“accumulator”. In this case, it makes sense to combine 
aspects into aspect groups. 
Aspect-based sentiment analysis of the review is a 
more difficult task and consists of two stages – identifying 
all product’s aspects and determining the customers’ 
sentiment of the comment on them. To complete the task 
of the aspect-based sentiment analysis, we developed a 
simple algorithm (see Figure 6). Aspects extraction based 
on the frequency of nouns and noun phrases mentioned in 
reviews based on work [29]. 
A frequency vocabulary [30] (created on text corpus) 
that helps to compare the obtained frequencies from 
reviews with frequencies from corpus is used to identify 
aspects. The nouns with maximum frequency deviations 

150

are claimants to be included into aspect groups. Clustering 
of the nouns into aspect groups was carried out manual. It 
should be noted, that if a sentence includes nouns from 
several aspect groups, then it would refer to opinion about 
each aspect group of these nouns. 
Aspect extraction 
Input: set of reviews D 
1. Extract all nouns S from the set of reviews D. 
2. Count the frequency of nouns 
 in the 
whole set of reviews D, where N – number of appearances of 
all words, Nt – number of appearances of the t noun. 
3. Count the difference 
 between the 
counted frequencies fi and vocabulary frequencies ftV. 
4. Sort the set of nouns S in descending order  ∆t. 
5. Divide the set of nouns S from 
 into aspect groups. 
Output: set of aspect groups and aspect words 
 
Aspect-based sentiment classification 
Input: sentiment classifier, set of aspect groups and aspect 
words 
1. Divide a set of reviews into set of sentences. 
2. Perform sentiment classification for each sentence. 
3. Check each sentence for the condition: if a sentence has a 
sentiment score (negative or positive) greater than a 
threshold h and contains at least one noun from any aspect 
group, then this sentence is labeled as an opinion (negative 
or positive) about the given product’s aspect. 
Output: labeled sentences with mentions about product’s 
aspects 
 
Figure 6.  Algorithm of aspect-based sentiment analysis 
The results of sentiment analysis and aspect-based 
sentiment analysis can be presented in the form of text 
variables
, where Obj – a object or a product, Revi – text of the i 
review, Senti – sentiment label of i review, Negij – negative 
sentences with mention about the j aspect group in the i 
review, Posij – positive sentences with mention about the j 
aspect group in the i review, i – number  of review, j – 
number of aspect group, m – amount  of aspect groups. 
D. Data Mining 
The present paragraph suggests an algorithm of the 
following processing of results of sentiment analysis and 
aspect-based sentiment analysis. The aim of the developed 
algorithm is to discover latent knowledge that can be used 
for decision support in product quality management. To 
realize this algorithm we use the Data Mining method – 
decision tree, since it is easy to understand and interpret 
results. It also can explain relations between overall 
sentiment of review and sentiment of each aspect group by 
means of Boolean logic. 
Input: positive and negative sentences with mentions about 
product’s aspects 
, 
vector of sentimental labels Sent of reviews. 
1. Convert a text data 
 into a 
boolean type by the following rules: 
 
2. If 
, then 
, else 
 
3. If 
, then 
, else 
 
4. If 
, then 
, else 
 
5. Creating a decision tree where the variable 
 is a 
dependent variable from 
 
6. Estimation significances of aspect groups and interpretation 
of extracted rules 
Output: significance values of product’s aspects, latent 
relations between satisfaction with product and satisfaction with 
aspects 
Figure 7.  Algorithm of data mining 
The developed algorithm of knowledge discovery 
includes procedures presented in Figure 7. The main idea 
of this algorithm is to convert results of aspect-based 
sentiment analysis to Boolean data considering both 
positive and negative mentions about product’s aspects. 
Then we apply decision tree for obtained Boolean data. 
The described algorithm allows understanding of which 
sentiment sentences about a product’s aspects  influence 
the overall sentiment of review or, in other words, what 
product aspects influence customer satisfaction and in 
what way. The constructed decision tree model allows the 
consideration of the influence on overall satisfaction with 
product of not only each satisfaction with some product’s 
aspect, but also mutual presence of satisfaction and 
dissatisfaction with different product’s aspects in the 
review. In other words, this approach is able to identify 
non-linear dependencies between overall satisfaction with 
product and satisfaction with product’s aspects. The 
decision tree model also allows the detection of the most 
significant product's aspects that are essential for the 
customer. 
In Figure 8 an example of decision tree model is 
presented. Nodes of the decision tree are the sentiment 
aspects’ variables, i.e., presence or absence in the review 
sentimental sentences (positive or negative) with mention 
about some aspect from aspect group. Edges of the tree are 
the values of aspect variables, i.e., 1 is presence, 0 is 
absence. Leaves present overall sentiment of review, i.e., 
each branch leads to either a positive review or a negative 
review that meets customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction 
in dependence, which product’s aspects satisfy or 
dissatisfy the customer.  
The decision tree model can be expressed both in the 
form of Boolean functions (see Eq. (1)) in a disjunctive 
normal form, and in natural language as rules:

Figure 8.  Example of the Decision Tree model 
Each rule is characterized by measures of confidence 
and support. The confidence shows what percentage of 
reviews containing conditions of some rule, has the same 
sentiment corresponding to this rule. The support shows 
percentage of reviews that contain conditions of some rule 
regarding the entire number of reviews. 
E. Measures for customer satisfaction 
As a measure of the customer satisfaction with product 
is used a ratio of positive reviews to the sum of positive 
and negative reviews. The score of customer satisfaction 
CS by product is calculated by (2): 


where Zpos  – the number of positive reviews, Zneg  – the 
number of negative reviews. 
As a measure of the customer satisfaction with 
product’s aspect groups is used a ratio of positive 
sentences with mentions of a product’s aspect to the sum 
of positive and negative sentences with mentions of a 
product’s aspect. The score of customer satisfaction csj 
with j product’s aspect group is calculated by (3):

 – number of positive sentences containing 
mention about the j product’s aspect group, 
 – number 
of negative comments containing mention about the j 
product’s aspect group. Unlike indices in [3] (which often 
represent the average subjective values obtained with 
using rating scales) proposed measures show the ratio of 
positive / negative reviews to total number of reviews. It 
gives more clearer for understanding of monitoring results. 
Significance of aspects group shows how much the 
sentiment of a review depends on the aspect group in 
positive and negative sentences, i.e., significance of 
product’s aspects for customers. Let the number of aspect 
groups is g/2, then the number of independent sentimental 
variables g. According to the methodology described in

V. EXPERIMENT 
A. Qualitative and quantitative surveys for hotels 
The proposed approach can be applied for one 
language (English or French or German etc.).  The 
approach is sensitive for reviewer’s eloquence, command 
of the language, richness of expression, because we don’t 
use specific techniques for this. Nevertheless, we assume 
that the sensitivity to linguistic peculiarities of review's 
text will decline with an increase in the training sample. 
Efficacy evaluation of the developed IDSS was 
performed on the data obtained from 635,824 reviews 
about hotels in the Russian language. The reviews have 
been collected from the popular Internet resource 
tophotels.ru for the period of 2003-2013. The initial 
structure of the collected data consisted of the following 
fields: hotel name; country name; resort name; visit date; 
review's text; author's ratings of placement, food, and 
service. The data was preprocessed and loaded into the 
database SQL Server 2012. 
Classifying of overall sentiment about product used a 
binary scale (negative and positive). A training set of 
positive and negative reviews was formed using the 
collected data on an author’s ratings of placement, food, 
and service. The review site tophotels.ru uses a five-point 
grading scale. A review can have a maximum total rating

of 15 points, and minimum total rating of 3 points. The 
training set included 15,790 negative reviews that have 3 
and 4 total points, and 15,790 positive reviews that have 
15 total points. We did not use the author's ratings for 
further data processing. Classification of another 604,244 
reviews was carried out using a trained classifier. 
For the purpose of training an effective sentiment 
classifier, the accuracy of classification was evaluated for 
machine learning methods and some peculiarities of their 
realization (see Table I). The measure accuracy as a ratio 
of the number of correctly classified reviews to total 
number of reviews was used to estimate classification 
accuracy. Accuracy estimation was performed on two sets 
of data. The first set (Test No. 1) represented a training set 
of strong positive (15,790) and strong negative reviews 
(15,790). Classifiers were tested by using cross validation 
by dividing the first set into 10 parts. The second set (Test 
No. 2) included random reviews from initial set of reviews 
(635,824) with different total points (3-15 points) and was 
labeled manual (497 positive and 126 negative). It was 
used only for accuracy control of the classifier that had 
been trained on the first data set.

a. Naïve Bayes Classifier. b. Support Vector Machine 
To estimate influence of negative particles “not” and 
“no”, the tagging technique was used; for example, the 
phrase “not good” was marked as “not_good”, and was 
regarded by the classifier as one word. This negation 
technique 
allowed 
the 
increasing 
of 
sentiment 
classification accuracy (see classifier #7). Accuracy values 
are presented in the Table I. We used results obtained by 
Pang and Lee [19] for movie-review domain as a base line. 
Our results of classification accuracy looks better than the 
base line. This can be explained that we used more large 
training sample (31,580 vs 2,053).  The most efficient ML 
method was Naïve Bayes classifier with negation 
technique (classifier  #7). In Figure 9 are presented ROC-
curves classifiers #4 and #7. The classifier #7 was trained 
on the training set and was used for further sentiment 
analysis of unlabeled reviews. 
Using the aspect extraction algorithm (Section III), we 
extracted the nouns that were divided into seven basic 
aspect groups (see Figure 10): “beach/swimming pool”, 
“food”, “entertainment”, “place”, “room”, “service”, 
“transport”. The following step was extracting and 
sentiment classification sentences with words from aspect 
groups using classifier #7.  However, not all sentences 
with aspects had a clearly expressed sentiment; therefore, 
the sentences with poorly expressed sentiment were 
filtered out using threshold h. Threshold h was chosen 
empirically and it allowed to cut sentences with weak 
sentiment. This algorithm of aspect-based sentiment 
analysis (Figure 6) is very simple and primitive, but it 
allows to realize its main aim - to identify sentences with 
strong sentiments (that form overall sentiment of review) 
with mentions about product's aspects, and filter out 
sentences with weak sentiment or without mentions about 
product's aspects.

Figure 10.  Aspect groups of object “hotel” 
In present work we give an example of qualitative and 
quantitative surveys for two 5-star hotels “A” (1692 
reviews) and “B” (1,300 reviews) located on the resort 
Sharm el-Sheikh (63,472 reviews) in Egypt. Firstly, we 
will make a quantitative survey, measure customer 
satisfaction, compare it with average satisfaction in the 
whole resort, detect negative trends by each hotel's aspect 
group, and identify problems in the quality of hotels.

The dynamics of customer satisfaction calculated by 
equation (2) is presented in Figure 11. Concerning the 
hotel “A”, there is a positive upward satisfaction trend 
from 2009, and it fixes on the average-resort level in 2013. 
Concerning the hotel “B”, in 2012 there was a sharp 
satisfaction decline and the same sharp increase in 2013. 
We can also notice that on a monthly graph (Figure 12). 
For the hotel “B”, satisfaction decrease started in June 
2012, and stopped in October 2012. Then, customer 
satisfaction grew to the level that was higher than the 
average resort level being ahead of its competitor – hotel 
“A”. 
 
Figure 11.  Dynamics of the consumer satisfaction by years. 
 
Figure 12.  Dynamics of the customer satisfaction by months. 
To find reasons of hotel “B” satisfaction decrease, we 
will examine structure of customer satisfaction with 
product in Figure 13. We can see that in 2012, the hotel 
“B” on average was second to the hotel “A” in such 
aspects as “room” (∆12%), “place” (∆8%), “service” 
(∆5%), 
“beach/swimming 
pool” 
(∆3%) 
and 
“entertainment” (∆3%). To complement the overall picture 
of the level of quality we have included in the analysis 
mentions about “theft” and “intoxication”. In 2012, the 
Hotel “B” had more registered cases of intoxication in 
September 2012, as well as cases of theft in August 2012 
(see Figure 15). We should also note that one of the 
reasons of customer dissatisfaction with the hotel “B” was 
the initiated repair of hotel rooms and buildings, which, 
however, paid off in 2013. Customer satisfaction with the 
hotel “A” aspects conforms with the average resort level. 
In 2013, customer satisfaction with product’s aspect 
groups with the hotel “B” exceeded the average level in all 
aspect groups (see Figure 14). Customer satisfaction with 
the hotel “A” dropped lower than average values in such 
aspects 
as 
“service” 
(∆3%), 
“food” 
(∆3%), 
“beach/swimming pool” (∆3%) and “transport” (∆4%). 
For hotel “A” manager arise questions like: which aspects 
are the most significant for the customer and that should 
be improved in the first place,  is it possible to “substitute” 
the dissatisfaction with the service, e.g., by tasty food or 
employ new entertainer?

Decision Trees were constructed using algorithm C4.5 
and a tool “Deductor” [31]. At the first step was 
constructed a tree for the all hotels of resort. Extracted 
rules are represented in Table III. At the second step trees 
were constructed for hotel “A” and hotel “B”. Significance 
values of a product’s aspect groups are represented in 
Table II. In Figure 13, there are the decision trees created 
for hotel “A” and hotel “B”. Due to the large size of the 
produced decision tree of the whole resort we omitted it, 
but in the Table III its rules are presented that have 
confidence >80% and support >5% (it is five rules from 
27).

By analyzing significance values (see Table II) of 
product’s aspect group on overall review’s sentiment (i.e., 
on customer satisfaction), we can say that the main factors 
of consumer dissatisfaction are a low service level 
(34.8%), problems with food (16%), and complaints about 
the hotel rooms (4%). The most critical aspect group for 
the hotel “B” is “room” (57.3%). In absence of negative 
opinions on the aspect group “room”, the review would be 
positive with a confidence of 95.5% (see Table III, rule 
#10 ). That is why the repair that was performed facilitated 
to a significant increase of consumer satisfaction.  The 
most critical aspect group for the Hotel “A” is “service” 
that corresponds with the resort in a whole.

Figure 15.  Customer satisfaction with product’s aspect groups by 
month. 
Using significance values, we can relate each aspect 
group with Kano’s model categories [19]. Negative 
mentions about aspect group “service” in review have high 
significance on customer satisfaction, but positive 
mentions have significance is near zero (34.8% vs. 0.7%). 
That’s why we can say that aspect group “service” relates 
to “Must-be quality” of Kano’s categories. This is 
interpreted as a positive mentions about aspect groups 
“service” do not have an influence on sentiment of review, 
i.e., on overall satisfaction with hotel. That means the 
consumer a priori awaits a high-level service as a matter of 
course.

Figure 16.  Decision trees for hotels. 
For such aspect groups as “food” and “room” 
significance values are comparable (30.3% vs. 16% for 
“food” and 4% vs. 2.1% for “room”), that relates to “One-
dimensional quality” of Kano’s categories. That means 
that customer satisfaction rising with rising quality of 
aspect groups “food” and “room” and reducing when 
reducing quality of these aspect groups. 
Aspect 
groups 
“beach/swimming 
pool”, 
“entertainment” and “place” relates to “Attractive quality” 
because only positive mentions about them have a 
significance on customer satisfaction. That means that 
customer satisfaction rising with rising quality of aspect 
groups “beach/swimming pool”, “place” and “territory”, 
but does not reducing when reducing quality of these 
aspect groups. 
In some cases, positive mentions about “food” and 
“entertainment” simultaneously in a review could 
substitute negative mentions about “services” and provide 
a positive review. That is why the hotel's aspects, which 
are contributing to customer satisfaction and important for 
both the resort and for the hotels, are good food and 
amusing entertainment activities. Customer satisfaction 
with these aspect groups can overlap dissatisfaction with

Then we compared frequency of nouns from aspect

with frequency of nouns. For example, the most frequent 
aspect 
groups 
in 
reviews 
are 
“room” 
and 
“beach/swimming pool”, but these aspect groups have low 
significance in contrast to “service” and “food”. It also

The performed qualitative survey allowed the detection 
of the main ways to increase customer satisfaction for 
hotel “A”. The problem aspect groups identified through 
quantitative survey correspond to the most significant 
aspects detected during the qualitative research. Hotel “A” 
manager should firstly increase “service” quality, and then 
increase the quality of “food” and “beach/swimming pool” 
maintenance. “Transport” problems – concerning flights, 
early check-in, and baggage storage – are not significant 
for customers and can be solved in the frames of service 
improvement. The process of service quality increase can 
take much time; that is why organizing entertainment and 
animated programs together with enhancement of 
restaurant service could be immediate measures for 
increasing 
customer 
satisfaction. 
Specification 
of 
managerial decisions can be performed on the basis of the 
information on existing problems contained in negative 
reviews. The extracted sentences on aspects can be 
directed to the appropriate hotel services. 
B. Qualitative and quantitative surveys for banks 
For the qualitative and quantitative surveys for banks, 
we used small sample of consumer reviews – 1,153 
reviews of Russian banks from site banki.ru. The sample 
consists of 304 positive reviews and 849 negative reviews 
in Russian. 
It should be noted that the data is skewed towards 
negative reviews. This is because customers often leave a 
review in the case of dissatisfaction with the bank. In the 
absence of dissatisfaction, customers do not have a motive 
to leave a positive review. As we see studies in the respect 
of hotels and resorts, in contrast, show a skew towards 
positive reviews. We should note that identifying all of a 
product’s aspects depends on reviewers’ mentioning them 
all in the reviews. That is why very important to make 
satisfaction customer research using a large enough sample 
of positive and negative reviews, which would have 
covered mentions with all aspects of the product. In this 
case, the observing skew of positive and negative reviews 
has no effect on the significance values (4) of aspects and 
identified rules of decision trees (1) as for any other data 
mining problem. On the other hand, the skew is important 
for measuring customer satisfaction with product (2) and 
product’s aspects (3). 
To estimate accuracy of machine learning methods we 
used a cross-validation. Evaluation of the accuracy of the 
classifiers is calculated as the proportion of correctly 
classified positive and negative feedback on their total 
number. Results are presented in the Table V.

Accuracy values of the classification machine learning 
methods are comparable. For the sentiment analysis was 
chose Naive Bayes classifier with frequency vector. In this 
experiment, we also used tagging technique of negative 
particles “not” and “no”. This technique has improved the 
classification accuracy to 88%. On the sample of bank 
reviews were extracted various aspects of banking.

Extracted aspects grouped by groups are shown in the 
Table VI. These aspect groups are used for the aspect-

Then we carried out quantitative and qualitative 
surveys of consumer satisfaction for four Russian banks: 
VTB24 (120 reviews), Alpha-Bank (131 reviews), 
Sberbank (232 reviews), Bank Russian Standard (86 
reviews). The results of the quantitative survey are 
presented in the Table VII. Among these banks, the most 
satisfied customers are the customers of the VTB24 (35% 
positive reviews). Then follows Alfa-Bank and Sberbank 
(26.7% and 19.8%, respectively). At the last place is the 
Bank Russian Standard (14% positive reviews). These 
satisfaction 
values 
corresponds 
with 
customers’ 
satisfaction values presented on the site as known as 
“People's rating”.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis allowed evaluating 
consumer satisfaction with specific aspect groups of 
banking services. For example, although the first place in 
overall satisfaction, VTB 24 has a lower satisfaction on 
card products than those of Alfa Bank. However, there are 
problems with credit products at Alfa-Bank, because 
customers complain about unreasonable delay cases and 
the emergence of debt on loans.  
Based on sentiment analysis reviews and aspect-based 
sentiment analysis we constructed decision tree. Obtained 
decision rules with confidence of more than 75% are 
shown in Table VIII. Rule #1 means that the absence of 
positive mentions about the staff and cards lead to negative 
reviews with confidence 92.9%. 60.2% of all reviews 
contain this rule. Positive mentions about staff without 
negative mentions about staff and settlement and cash 
services lead to positive reviews with confidence 79.4% 
(rule #2).

Table IX shows the estimated values of the 
significance values of aspect groups for customers. The 
greatest impact on customer satisfaction have positive and 
negative mentions about bank' staff. Next in significance 
aspect groups are card products and Settlement and cash 
services. The rest of the aspect groups have significance 
values near zero.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Poor quality of products and services contributes to a 
decrease of customer satisfaction. On the other hand, 
under the conditions of stiff competition, there are no 
barriers for the consumer to change the supplier of goods 
and services. All these things can cause loss of clients and 
a decrease of a company’s efficiency indexes. Therefore, 
maintaining high-quality standards should be provided by 
effective managerial decisions and based on opinion 
mining as a feedback. 
The suggested conception of decision support based on 
the developed approach of text data processing and 
analysis allows performing quantitative and qualitative 
surveys of customer satisfaction using computer-aided 
procedures, and making effective managerial decisions on 
product quality management. The present conception 
allows effective reduction of labor intensity of customer 
satisfaction research that makes it available for use by a 
wide range of companies.

A prototype of IDSS was developed on the basis of the 
suggested conception. The performed experiment has 
proved its efficacy for solving real problems of quality 
management  and consistency of the results obtained. 
IDSS enables companies to make decisions on quality 
control based on analytical processing of text data 
containing implicit information on client satisfaction.  
Future research on the given topic can be devoted to 
automatic annotating of text data, representing text amount 
of review in the form of a summary, and extracting useful 
and unique information.
