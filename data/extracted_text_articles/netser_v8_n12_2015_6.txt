Abstract—Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system
provides a promising physical layer for 4G and 3GPP LTE
systems in terms of efﬁcient use of bandwidth and high data
rates, this technology suffers from Inter Symbol Interference
and Inter Carrier Interference. On the other hand, multiple
input - multiple output system is deployed along with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing in the new 802.11n standard,
which offers many advantages over conventional standards
such as 802.11g Wireless LAN. The main challenge of such
system is the synchronization between the transmitter and the
receiver [1]. A bad timing synchronization causes the loss of a lot
of information in a MIMO-OFDM system. In this paper, a robust
timing synchronization method is proposed for a MIMO-OFDM
systems up to 8 × 8 as well, where Nt is the transmit antennas
and Nr is the receive antennas. The proposed method is based
on transmit a mapped orthogonal constant amplitude zero
auto correlation sequences over different transmit antennas.
The simulations results show that the proposed method has
high performance to detect the timing synchronization even
at very low signal to noise ratio in additive white Gaussian
noise and multipath fading Rayleigh channels. Furthermore,
simulation results for our proposed method present a robust
timing synchronization against existing methods at a low SNR
and for MIMO-OFDM system up to 8 × 8, which the coarse and
ﬁne timing synchronization are done at the same time at each
receive antenna due to the orthogonality of different training
sequences transmitted over different transmit antennas.

I. INTRODUCTION
The
wireless-communications
revolution
grows
continuously in order to increase throughput, which can only
be achieved through the development of new communication
technologies. In this context, different wireless communication
technologies offer enormous increase of channel capacity
like Multiple Input Multiple Output - Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Therefore,
the combination between MIMO and OFDM systems is
proposed in 802.11n [2].
The OFDM [3] is a digital Multi-carrier modulation
technology in which a large number of closely spaced
orthogonal subcarriers are used to carry the data. OFDM
became a very popular multi-carrier modulation technique
for transmission of signals over wireless channels. OFDM
has been deployed in many applications like IEEE 802.11a,
HIPERLAN/2 wireless LANs, Digital Video Broadcasting,
and satellite radio.
It divides the data into several orthogonal and parallel
data streams (Nsc) called sub-carrier or sub-channel. Each
sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation
such as M-ary schemes like Phase Shift Keying (M-PSK)
or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), also, the total
data rate is maintained similar to those in a conventional
single-carrier modulation scheme in the same bandwidth.
To maintain the orthogonality, the space required between
two consecutive sub-carriers is ∆f =
1
Ts , where Ts is the
duration of OFDM symbol.
The implementation of OFDM systems is very easy, on
the other hand, the OFDM modulator/demodulator can be
done by a simple Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) and
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm [4], respectively. The
main drawback of OFDM technology is high Peak-to-Average
Power ratio (PAPR), which means randomly sinusoidal leads
occurred during transmission of the OFDM signal.
Otherwise, OFDM technology suffers from Inter Symbol
Interference (ISI) and Inter Carrier Interference (ICI). OFDM
uses Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) or Guard Interval (GI) in order to
combat the ISI and ICI introduced by the multi-path channel
through, which the signal is propagated. The main idea is to
append the last part of the OFDM time-domain waveform
from the back to the front to create a guard period. The
duration of the guard period Tg should be longer than τmax,
where τmax designed the Channel Impulse Response (CIR)
of the target multi-path environment. The total duration of
the OFDM symbol is Ttot = Ts + Tg.
Furthermore,
Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output
(MIMO)
system is an array of Nt transmit antenna and Nr receive
antenna. Such systems are used to improve wireless systems
capacity, range and reliability. Several applications, based

generation of mobile network and Long-Term
Evolution (LTE). MIMO system offers a way to increase data
throughput and link range without additional bandwidth or
increased transmit power. In order to achieve this goal, MIMO
system spread the same total transmit power over different
transmit antennas to improve the spectral efﬁciency (Spatial
Multiplexing (SM)). On the other hand, MIMO uses Space
Time Coding (STC) in order to improve the link reliability.
1) Spatial Multiplexing technique (SM): The Spatial mul-
tiplexing is a transmission technique in MIMO wireless
communication used to transmit independent and sepa-
rately encoded data streams, from each of the multiple
transmit antennas. This technique is used in order to
increase the throughput of such wireless communication
system. Therefore, the space dimension is reused, or
multiplexed, more than one time. If the transmitter is
equipped with Nt antennas and the receiver has Nr an-
tennas, Foshini et al. [5] and Telatar [6] have shown that
the theoretical capacity of the MIMO channel, with Nt
and Nr conﬁguration, grows linearly with min(Nt, Nr)
rather than logarithmically. The channel capacity of a
MIMO system is deﬁned by (1) [5] [6]:

• H
: MIMO channel matrix Nt × Nr.
• ρ =
P
No.B: Signal to noise ratio (SNR).
• P
: Total transmitted power.
• N0 : Power Spectral Density (PSD).
2) Spatial Diversity technique (SD): Spatial diversity tech-
nique rely on transmitting simultaneously, redundant
copies of data stream on different transmit antennas. The
receiver combines the multiple copies of data on each
of the received antennas, due to this combination, the
error rate of retrieved data will be pretty much less [7].
Space Time Code (STC) is the technique to exploit spatial
diversity, which may be split into two main types:
• Space-Time Trellis Codes (STTCs) [8]: This tech-
nique is used to distribute a trellis code over multiple
transmit antennas and multiple time-slots, further-
more, it provides both coding gain and diversity gain.
• Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs): The STBC is
a technique to transmit multiple copies of a data
stream across Nt transmit antennas in a MIMO
system. It exploits the spatial diversity and increases
the reliability of transmission. This type of code is
divided into three main approaches [9]: OSTBC (Or-
thogonal Space-Time Block Codes), NOSTBC (Non-
Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes) and QSTBC
(Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes).
In this paper, we will focus on spatial diversity technique
using STBC (Space-Time Block Code) with Alamouti [10]
encoder.
The combination of MIMO-OFDM systems are used
to reach the higher data rate transmission or improve the
spectrum efﬁciency of wireless link reliability in wireless
communication
systems.
The
main
challenges
of
such
systems is the synchronization between transmitter and
receiver. Two main types of synchronization are necessary,
the frequency and the timing synchronization. The frequency
synchronization is to correct the phase error caused by the
mismatch of the local oscillator (LO) between transmitter
and receiver [11] or due to the Doppler effect. On the other
hand, Timing synchronization is divided into frame timing
synchronization (Coarse timing synchronization) and symbol
timing synchronization (Fine timing synchronization). Frame
timing synchronization used to detect the arrival of the
OFDM frame and symbol timing synchronization is needed
in order to detect the beginning of each OFDM symbols on
each frame. Here we focus on symbol timing synchronization
in MIMO-OFDM systems.
In the literature, several synchronization approaches have
been proposed for OFDM and MIMO-OFDM systems
[1],
[12]–[20]. The main idea is to ﬁnd a good synchronization
preamble, at the transmitter, in order to detect the packet
arrival, at the receiver.
In this paper, we propose a robust timing synchronization
preamble
for
MIMO-OFDM
systems
using
orthogonal
CAZAC
(Constant
Amplitude
Zero
Auto-Correlation)
sequences.
The
CAZAC
sequences
[21]
have
constant
amplitude and zero autocorrelation for all non-zero shifts.
The main characteristics of CAZAC sequences are their
correlation functions. They have a good autocorrelation
function and their crosscorrelation function is near zero. Due
to their orthogonality, CAZAC sequences reduce inter-code
interference between multiple antennas and have a lower
PAPR. As a result, CAZAC sequences are regarded as
optimum preamble for timing synchronization in MIMO-
OFDM systems.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the MIMO-OFDM system based on STBC code. Existing
approaches and related work are presented in Section III.
Section IV presents the criteria for selecting a good synchro-
nization sequences. The working principle of the proposed
method and the different preamble structure is presented in
Section V. Simulation results and conclusion are discussed in

II. MIMO-OFDM SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Basically, MIMO-OFDM radio communication system con-
sists of a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver. In this section,
we present the different parts of MIMO-OFDM communi-
cations system. The transmitter generates OFDM symbols,
which are modulated using M-air modulation, then, they are
transmitted over multiple transmit antennas using STBC block
[9] [10]. Figure 1 presents a general MIMO-OFDM system
model with Nt transmit antennas, Nr receive antennas and
Nsc subcarriers per transmit antenna.
A. MIMO-OFDM transmitter
The ﬁrst part of MIMO-OFDM system is the transmitter.
In a OFDM transmitter, information data are transmitted
blockwise. The ﬁrst block is a data block where several
serial stream of data are generated. Then, a serial to parallel
block (S-to-P) converts the serial data stream to parallel data
stream. Subcarrier Mapping block is used in order to map
parallel data stream to complex symbols. This block uses
different constellation mapping either Phase Shift Keying
(PSK) or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). After
mapping, complex symbols are then introduced into a STBC
encoder (in this approach we use Alamouti Encoder). Then,
we use IFFT to modulate the parallel data stream in order to
generate the OFDM symbols over different transmit antennas.
After performing IFFT, the data is again converted into serial
stream. A cyclic preﬁx block named Add CP consists to
insert a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) or Guard Interval (GI), which is
appended at the start of the serial stream. The cyclic Preﬁx
is actually an exact copy of the last part or TG samples
of the data. The purpose of CP is to remove the ISI and
channel effects. The synchronization block is used in order
to insert the synchronization preamble at the beginning of
each OFDM frame. Two different approaches are presented,
the synchronization preamble is appended in frequency
domain [16] [20] or in time domain [19]. In this paper, we
focus on the ﬁrst approach.

where xk is the symbol on the frequency fk.
B. MIMO channel Model
The modelling of a practical MIMO channel includes the
transmit vector, receive vector, multi-path channel matrix
and Noise. The MIMO channel model between the transmit
antenna Ti and receive antenna Rj, where i ∈ {1, Nt} and
j ∈ {1, Nr}, is given by:

C. MIMO-OFDM Receiver
The second part of MIMO-OFDM system is the receiver.
The receiver is exactly the reverse of transmitter. The ﬁrst
block after the analog to digital converter (ADC) is the timing
synchronization block. After a good timing synchronization,
the cyclic preﬁx of each OFDM symbol is removed. After
removing CP, we perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
to return the data back into frequency domain. The data is
then feds into the equalizer and channel estimator. After
equalization, the data are are decoded by STBC decoder.
Then, a Subcarrier De-mapping block is presented in order to
demodulate and recover the binary information. The parallel
to serial (P-to-S) converter allows to reformatting the binary
bit stream.
The received signal rj on each receive antenna Rj is given

where hij is the channel between the transmit antenna Ti and

different channels paths, αp is the attenuation for the pth path,
si(t) is the OFDM transmitted signal, Pij is the number of
path between Ti and Rj and nij is the Additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) noise between Ti and Rj.
III. RELATED WORK
In the literature, several synchronization approaches have
been proposed for MIMO-OFDM, as shown in Section I. The
most of the synchronization methods are preamble based, that
means, the header of each OFDM frame contains a known
preamble structure. As in [22], authors provide a preamble
structure based on Loosely Synchronous (LS) codes for
timing and frequency synchronization for a MIMO-OFDM
system. This preamble is used in order to detect the beginning
of each received frame. The main characteristics of LS
codes is to have a good autocorrelation and cross-correlation
functions within certain vicinity of the zero shifts. In this
method, the synchronization process is divided into four
stages. The ﬁrst and the second stage are used in order to
estimate the coarse timing synchronization and the coarse
frequency synchronization, respectively. The third stage is to
detect the beginning of each OFDM symbols in each frame
and estimate the channel parameters. the fourth step is used
for the ﬁne frequency estimation. The main drawback of this
method is the structure of preambles, where it is relatively
complex. Another disadvantage of this method is the different
stage used in order to detect the beginning of frame.
Another approach proposed in [23] based on Orthogonal
Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) for timing synchronization.
In this approach, a Multiple Input-Single Output (MISO)
systems 2×1 is considered. The length of each OFDM symbol
and their CP is 256 and 32, respectively. The synchronization
preamble has the same length as the CP is appended at the
beginning of each OFDM frame. As result, this approach
shows that for MISO-OFDM systems 2 × 1, the timing
acquisition probability is 1 for an SNR ≥ −5 dB. Here,
timing acquisition probability describes the probability to
detect the timing synchronization point. The main drawback of
this approach is that the synchronization preamble is appended
in the time domain. With such hardware implementation,
authors need an extra block to insert the preamble in time
domain, while, in frequency domain their is no need to this
block due to the IFFT.
Based on Schmidl and Cox’s approach [12], Farhan
proposed in [24] a modiﬁed approach that is not using the
training sequence and making cyclic preﬁx (CP) as the
reference in order to obtain efﬁciency in transmitting power.
This approach uses the sliding window technique to compute
the correlation of the received signal with the cyclic preﬁx.
The main drawback of this method is the correlation with
the CP in multipath fading channel. In such channel, when
the receiver receives several delayed path with CP, the timing
metric obtained by the correlation shows more correlation
peak, then the receiver would not able to detect the start of
OFDM frame.
A
compact
preamble
design
for
synchronization
in
distributed MIMO-OFDM systems has been proposed in [25].
In this approach, a preamble structure based on exclusive sub-
band has been proposed. Adjacent sub-bands are spaced by
a guard bands to reduce the interference between sub-bands.
The total length of the proposed preamble based on CAZAC
sequences has the same length as an OFDM symbol. The
simulation results shown that for a MISO-OFDM (3 × 1), the
acquisition probability for timing synchronization is 70% for
an SNR = 5 dB. In this work, we compare the simulation
results of our proposed approach with those of the method

proposed by Chin-Liang et al. [25].
The proposed method in [25] suffers from several disad-
vantages, mainly the complexity to generate the preamble
structure for a large number of transmit antennas. In [25],
when the number of transmit antennas increases, the size of
sub-bands should be reduced to take into account all transmit
antennas. Therefore, at the receiver, the acquisition probability
for timing synchronization decreases due to the length of
synchronization sequence.
IV. OPTIMAL TRAINING SEQUENCES FOR TIMING
SYNCHRONIZATION
Timing synchronization methods are performed using train-
ing sequences at the beginning of each OFDM frame in
MIMO-OFDM systems. The main characteristic of training
sequences is to have good autocorrelation and cross-correlation
properties. At receiver, this characteristic provides a good
detection of a correlation peak as closed as possible to a Dirac
pulse. The main training sequences used in the state of art are
listed below.
A. Gold sequences
Gold sequences [26] of length N are constructed using a
preferred pair of Pseudorandom Noise (PN) sequences. Let a
and b are two preferred pair of m-sequences, those sequences
have a three valued correlation function:
θ(a,b) = −1, −t(m) or t(m) − 2
(5)
where
t(m) =
 1 + 2(m+2)/2
if m is even
1 + 2(m+1)/2
if m is odd
(6)
The set of Gold sequences includes the preferred pair of m-
sequences a and b, and the mod 2 sums of a and cyclic shifts
of b represented by the operator T −p. The set Sgold of Gold
sequences is given by:
Sgold = {a, b, a ⊕ b, a ⊕ T −1b, . . . , a ⊕ T −(N−1)b}
(7)
The maximum correlation value for any two Gold sequences
in the same set is equal to the constant t(m).
The main advantage of Gold sequence lies in sending
such sequences in periodic way to retain the good correla-
tion properties. In synchronization, such sequences are used
aperiodically, on the other hand, Gold sequences loses their
good correlation properties. The autocorrelation and cross-
correlation functions of aperiodic Gold sequences are shown
in Figure 2, where index represents indices at which the
correlation was estimated.

Another generation of code called Walsh-Hadamard code.
Such
codes

where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product. An Hadamard matrix
Hn satisﬁes the following property:
Hn.HT
n = nIn
where HT
n is the conjugate transpose of Hn and In is a n×n
identity matrix.
The main advantage of Hadamard code is the orthogonality
between the different code. On the other hand, the autocorre-
lation function for some code has secondary peak as shown
in Figure 3.
C. CAZAC sequences
A Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC)
sequence [28] c(m) is a complex sequence and has constant
magnitude, |c(m)| = 1 for m ∈ [0, LC −1] where LC = 2n is
the ﬁnite length of c(m), n ∈ N, and has zero-autocorrelation
function with shifted version of the same sequence. The cross-
correlation function of CAZAC sequences has a value near to
zero.

D. Optimal sequence selection
In MIMO system, unlike Single Input Single Output (SISO)
system, we need to send several data at one time according
the number of transmit antennas. In this context, the optimal
training sequences should have a good autocorrelation and
crosscorrelation functions in order to distinguish the different
received signal at the receiver. Gold sequences have a good
autocorrelation function, on the other hand, they have a high
value for their cross-correlation function. Hadamard sequences
have a good autocorrelation and crosscorrelation functions

of different sequences, our work was focused on the use of
CAZAC sequence as training sequences for timing synchro-
nization in MIMO-OFDM systems.
V. PROPOSED TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION PREAMBLE
In this section, based on [1], we propose our robust timing
synchronization preamble in MIMO-OFDM systems based on
CAZAC sequence. Let C be a CAZAC sequence of length
LC, where LC represents the size of synchronization preamble
divided by 2, in other term LC = LF F T /2 where LF F T is
the size of the FFT, and C∗ denotes the conjugate of C. We
propose in this section two different structures, as follows.
A. First preamble structure
The timing synchronization preamble is generated in
frequency domain, then it is added at the beginning of each
OFDM frame according to transmit antenna. Figure 5 shows
the structure of the ﬁrst proposed preamble in frequency
domain over different transmit antennas.
The preamble structure in Figure 5 relies in sending a
CAZAC sequence (C) over the odd subcarrier, in frequency
domain, and C∗ on the even subcarrier. The preamble ℘i
that transmitted on the ith transmit antenna is given by the
following equation:

k is the sample of the CAZAC sequence carried
by the kth subcarrier and transmitted by the transmitting
antenna Ti. The proposed method can be applied regardless
of the number of transmit or receive antennas.
Figure 6 shows the real and imaginary parts of timing
synchronization preamble in time domain.
The combination of a CAZAC sequence C with its con-
jugate C∗ gives a time-domain complex envelope form that
have a good autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions.
This combination does not destroy the orthogonality between
subcarriers, and it retains the orthogonality between different
preambles over different transmit antennas.

VI. SIMULATIONS RESULTS
In this section, we present the simulation parameters and
simulation results for different preamble’s structure in AWGN
channel and multipaths fading channel, in order to evaluate
the performance of our proposed preambles against [25].
A. System speciﬁcations & simulation parameters
In order to improve the simulation results, we simulate
our preamble structures with different system speciﬁcation
and simulation parameters. Simulations results are done with
SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM systems up to 8 × 8. On
the other hand, the OFDM system consists of 512 and
1024 subcarriers, where LF F T = {512, 1024}, respectively.

Our proposed method consists of detecting coarse and ﬁne
timing synchronization in one operation, this is the main
advantage of our proposed method. We implement at each
receiver a correlation function Rrj,seqj in order to detect the
timing synchronization peak between the received signal rj
and the local sequence seqj generated by the receive antenna
Rj. This correlation is done in time domain. Due to the
mapped CAZAC sequence (C and C∗) in each preamble,
the correlation between received signal and local sequence
may give a high peak’s value, this function is calculated as
following:
Rrj,seqj(n) =
LF F T −1
X
n=0
[rj(n) ∗ seqj(n − τ)]
(13)
where n is the index of the sample. The correlation function
Rrj,seqj feed into an estimator in order to detect the coarse
timing synchronisation. The timing synchronization estimate
is given by:
ˆ
indn = argmax
n
{∥Rrj,seqj(n)∥}
(14)
where n is considered as the coarse timing synchronization
point. At the same time, and, by shifting the FFT window,
we can ﬁnd the ﬁne timing synchronization or the beginning
of each OFDM symbol on each frame. Let PSY NC describes
the timing synchronization acquisition probability. PSY NC
presents the probability of successful timing synchronization
at receiver.
C. Simulation results for the ﬁrst preamble structure
Simulation results for all preamble structures, are done
using simulation parameters in Tables I and II. Figures 10
and 11 show the acquisition probability for different SISO
and MIMO-OFDM systems, where the length of preamble
are LF F T = 1024 and LF F T = 512.
Figure 10 presents a good timing synchronization for a
low SNR. For an SNR = −5dB, the PSY NC ≥ 90% for
all MIMO-OFDM system up to 8 × 8. Therefore, for an
SNR = 0dB, the proposed timing synchronization preamble
shows a perfect timing synchronization for SISO-OFDM
system. The PSY NC ≥ 97% for MIMO-OFDM system 2 × 2
for the same SNR. For a MIMO-OFDM system 4 × 4 the
PSY NC ≥ 96% at an SNR = 5dB. On the other hand,
for MIMO-OFDM system 8 × 8, the acquisition probability
PSY NC reaches 98% at an SNR = 10dB.

Table III summarizes the simulation results of Figures 10
and 11. It can be shown that the performance of our timing
synchronization method increases with the length of LF F T .

Moreover, the results of Figure 10 (LF F T = 1024) show
a good performance against those presented in Figure 11
(LF F T = 512).
In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed
method, we conducted an extensive comparison of our
approach with the synchronization scheme of [25]. Hung
and Chin Wang [25] used a subband-based preamble based
on CAZAC sequences. The main drawback of this method
is the number of transmit antennas. As the number of
transmit antennas increases, the length of synchronization
sequence, on each transmit antenna, decreases. Therefore,
the value of the synchronization peak at the receiver decreases.
Figure 12 presents the performance between our proposed
approach and the synchronization scheme of [25]. Simulation
results in Figure 12 are done with the simulation parameters
of Tables I and II with a synchronization preamble of length
LF F T = 256, and MIMO-OFDM system 2 × 2 and 3 × 3.
Simulation results of our proposed approach have a good
performance against [25] at a low SNR. The acquisition
probability PSY NC for our method is greater than 90% at
an SNR ≥ 5 dB for both MIMO-OFDM 2 × 2 and 3 × 3
system. Therefore, the proposed method in [25] shows that
the acquisition probability is between 0.5 and 0.75 at the same
value of SNR.

LFFT = 512) are shown in Figures 13 and 14, respectively.
Figure 13 shows that for a LF F T
=
1024 and a
SNR ≥ −5 dB, the acquisition probability PSY NC is greater
than 95% for both SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM 2 × 2
systems. Otherwise, both systems have a perfect PSY NC for

for Hung-Chin’s method the PSY NC not exceed 0.6 for both

VII. CONCLUSION
In the last year, the telecommunications have been growing
in order to present a good quality of services (QoS) and large
bandwidth. Furthermore, in order to increase the capacity of
channel, or to improve the quality of the link, MIMO-OFDM
system was presented. On the other hand, such system has a
big challenge, which is the timing synchronization. Timing
synchronization means how to detect the beginning of each
received frames ad each symbols in the frame. In order to
detect the timing frame synchronization, we proposed two
robust timing synchronization preamble. At the transmitter,
a synchronization preamble is appended at the beginning
of each OFDM frame. This preamble is based on CAZAC
sequences, where those sequences have a good autocorrelation
and cross-correlation functions.
At each receiver, the received signal correlated with a local
sequence generated by the receiver. Due to the mapped of the
orthogonal CAZAC sequences over different subcarriers, a
correlation peak will appear in order to detect the beginning
of frame. In comparison to the subband preamble based
proposed by [25], our timing synchronization approaches
present a better timing frame synchronization at a low
SNR. Finally, we can perform coarse and ﬁne timing
synchronization using the same correlation peak.
In this paper, we can ﬁnd also a few degradation of
performance between our two approach. This degradation
is due to the mapped CAZAC sequence on each preamble
structure. Hence, as future work, it will be interesting to see the
performance of our approach for frequency synchronization.
