Abstract—In this paper, we consider a system operating in a
random
external
shock
process.
The
underlying
system
performance is modelled by a quality (output) function which
is decreasing due to degradation. Shocks affect the failure rate
of the system directly and, at the same time, they additionally
decrease the quality function. Expectations (unconditional and
conditional on survival) and variability of this time-dependent
quality function are analyzed.
Keywords-quality characteristic; random environment; shock
process; intensity process; variability measure.

INTRODUCTION
The performance of various engineering systems is often
characterized not only by reliability characteristics, but also
by characteristics of performance (output). For instance, a
quality function for production systems can be described by
the production rate, i.e., the number of items produced in a
unit interval of time. For navigation systems, this quality is
characterized by the accuracy of navigation parameters such
as heading, altitude and longitude. It is well understood that
most
engineering
systems
are
deteriorating
in
some
stochastic sense and deterioration affects not only reliability
indices but also the quality of performance [1][2]. [1] and
[2] have considered mostly deterministic quality function.
However, the quality or performance of a system should
depend on random operational environment. In this regard,
in this paper, we will consider stochastic quality functions.
In this paper, we study the reliability measure for a system
operating
in
a
random
environment.
The
random
environment is modeled by a process of external shocks.
We suggest a novel approach in shocks modeling when
shocks have a double effect, i.e., they act directly on the
failure rate (more precisely, on the corresponding failure
rate process) that characterizes the time to failure of a
system and, at the same time, on the quality function as
well. For example, for a network system, if a shock (e.g.,
external attack) occurs, the susceptibility to a failure of the
network increases and, at the same time, the performance of
the network decreases. To account for this complex
influence
and
to
obtain
explicit
expressions
for
characteristics
of
interest,
we
derive
the
necessary
conditional and unconditional average characteristics under
the assumption of the Non-homogeneous Poisson Process
(NHPP) of shocks. Specifically, we obtain the expectation
and the variance of the quality function of a system on
condition that a system is operable at a given instant of time
and without this condition.
In Section 2, we introduce the model studied in this
paper. Furthermore, the unconditional and conditional
expected quality functions are derived. In Section 3, the
unconditional and conditional variability measures are
obtained.
Finally,
in
Section
4,
we
provide
a
brief
conclusion.

jump in the failure rate on occurrence of each shock. Thus,
each shock increases
t in each realization of this stochastic
process by the same deterministic value.
Let
Q(t)
be a deterministic quality or performance
function of an operating system, which is monotonically
decreasing [1]. Moreover, assume also that the quality or
performance is decreasing on each shock. To account for
this effect of the shock process in a consistent way, we
assume that the quality at time t under a shock process is
given by the following stochastic process

In many instances and especially when considering
characteristics of quality in a population of systems, it could
be more interesting and practically sound to obtain the
expected quality for systems that are ‘operating at time t’.

IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have considered a system operating
under a random Poisson shock process. Each shock affects
the failure rate of the system and the quality of the system
simultaneously.
Under
the
suggested
model,
the
unconditional and conditional expected quality functions
have been derived. Furthermore, the unconditional and
conditional variability measures have also been obtained.
This paper extends the previous works [1][2] by considering
stochastic quality functions, which is practically meaningful
generalization.
