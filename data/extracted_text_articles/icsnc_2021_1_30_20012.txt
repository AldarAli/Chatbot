INTRODUCTION 
Radio spectrum is limited and not allocated to a Mobile 
Network Operator (MNO) in proportionate with its traffic 
demand [1].  To address the scarcity of the available 
licensed spectrum, techniques, including cell splitting and 
small cell deployment, have been proposed [2]. However, 
due to employing such techniques, no noticeable impact has 
been observed, which causes the focus of MNOs to shift 
from the licensed-only spectrum to the unlicensed spectrum. 
Recently, the operations of the Third Generation Partnership 
Project (3GPP)-based cellular technologies in the unlicensed 
bands have been introduced.  
Cellular technologies may operate in one or more 
unlicensed spectrum bands, including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 
GHz, and 60 GHz. Because the operation of the unlicensed 
spectrum is marked by regional regulatory authorities [3], of 
these, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 60 GHz bands are available 
worldwide [4], whereas the 6 GHz band is currently 
available in Europe and the USA. In addition to these 
above-unlicensed bands, cellular technologies, particularly, 
Fifth-Generation (5G) New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) can 
also use shared bands, including 3.5 GHz and 37 GHz, only 
in the USA [5]. Due to not having a significant difference in 
signal propagations, according to the 3GPP, 2.4 GHz, 3.5 
GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz are classified as low-frequency 
bands below 7 GHz, whereas 37 GHz and 60 GHz high-
frequency 
bands 
are 
classified 
as 
millimeter-wave 
(mmWave) bands. These two unlicensed frequency ranges 
are targeted for 5G NR-U operations [6]. 
Typically, an unlicensed spectrum is used by the 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 
802.11, also termed as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) [7], 
technologies in addition to Bluetooth and ZigBee. Hence, to 
operate cellular technologies in the same unlicensed band at 
the same place simultaneously, a proper coexistence 
mechanism to manage Co-Channel Interference (CCI) 
between cellular and WiFi technologies is necessary. 
Coexistence mechanisms can be developed in two ways 
depending on whether or not modifications on the existing 
cellular networks are employed. If modifications are 
employed, a cellular network is enabled with a carrier 
sensing mechanism, termed as Listen-Before-Talk (LBT).  
LBT is a contention-based medium access technique that 
shares a channel between a cellular node and a WiFi Access 
Point (AP) fairly [8] by enabling a cellular node to stop 
periodically its channel occupancy to help avoid CCI due to 
the coexistence with the WiFi AP. Likewise, numerous 
coexistence mechanisms without employing LBT have been 
proposed to manage CCI such as channel selection, carrier 
sense adaptive transmission, fully blank subframe, and 
transmit power control. In channel selection, a cellular node 
measures the level of interference on each channel by 
detecting the channel’s energy so that the data transmission 
can be made over a channel with the minimum level of 
interference. In carrier sense adaptive transmission, by 
dividing time into cycles each consisting of an on period 
and an off period such that a cellular node can transmit data 
during the on-state of a cycle. Likewise, in the fully blank 
subframe, time is segmented into transmission time intervals 
(TTIs) such that a cellular node can use a set of TTIs over a 
certain period T, whereas, IEEE 802.11 standards can 
transmit using the remaining number of TTIs in T 
orthogonally to each other in time.   A key feature of each of 
these mechanisms is that none requires modifications on 
existing cellular networks. Since our focus is mainly on the 
unlicensed bands for cellular networks, a detailed discussion 
on coexistence mechanisms is out of the scope of this paper.  
Numerous existing works addressed the operation of 
cellular standards such as Long-Term Evolution Unlicensed 
(LTE-U), Licensed Assisted Access (LAA), and NR-U on 
unlicensed bands from specific viewpoints, including 
coexistence mechanisms [9]-[19], unlicensed bands (e.g., 5

GHz [20]-[22], 6 GHz [23], and 60 GHz [24]), coexistence 
studies [25]-[26] and scenarios [27], fairness conditions 
[28]-[29], standardization efforts [30], challenges, and open 
problems [3] [31]. Different from these above existing 
studies, in this paper, we provide a survey on unlicensed 
spectrum bands from a nonspecific viewpoint that takes into 
account all available unlicensed spectrum bands in both the 
sub-7 GHz, including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz, as well 
as mmWave, including 60 GHz, for the cellular networks. 
Major aspects of each unlicensed band, including 
operational 
region, 
regulatory 
requirement, 
existing 
technology, available bandwidth, spectrum range, benefit, 
and challenge, are discussed. A comparative framework of 
all these aspects is then developed, and major benefits and 
challenges regarding the operation of cellular networks on 
unlicensed bands are pointed out. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, an 
overview of unlicensed spectrum bands, including 2.4 GHz, 
5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz, for cellular networks, as well 
as a comparative framework for a number of major aspects 
among these unlicensed bands are given. In Section III, the 
operation of cellular technologies, including LTE-U, LAA, 
and NR-U, in unlicensed bands is discussed. Key benefits 
and challenges of operating cellular networks in the 
unlicensed band are identified in Section IV. We conclude 
the paper in Section V. A list of abbreviations is given in 
Appendix I.  
II. 
OVERVIEW OF UNLICENSED SPECTRUM BANDS FOR 
CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES 
A. 2.4 GHz Unlicensed Band     
The 2.4 GHz band is the first unlicensed band released 
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for 
commercial use and is currently the most utilized unlicensed 
shared band [8]. In the 2.4 GHz band, the bandwidth is 
divided into 14 channels with a separation of 5 MHz from 
one channel to another. In the USA, operations on channels 
12 and 13 are allowed only under low power conditions 
[32]. Likewise, in Canada, of a total of 12 channels (from 
channel 1 to channel 12) available to use, the operation on 
channel 12 is limited by the transmission power. However, 
most of the rest of the world can use 13 channels (from 
channel 1 to channel 13) [32], and channel 14 is available 
only in Japan.  
B. 5 GHz Unlicensed Band     
      The use of the 5 GHz band depends on its requirement 
in a country [20]. The 5.15-5.35 GHz band is available in 
the USA, China, South Korea, Europe, Japan, and India; the 
5.47-5.725 GHz is available in the USA, South Korea, 
Europe, and Japan; and the 5.725-5.85 GHz is available in 
the USA, China, South Korea, and India [7]. Additionally, 
the 5.35-5.47 GHz and the 5.85-5.925 GHz unlicensed 
spectra are being considered to make available in the USA 
and Canada [3] [7] [8]. Moreover, European Commission 
(EC) also recently proposed to use the 5.725-5.85 GHz 
spectrum band [8]. In general, due to the clearer channel 
condition, wider spectrum, and easier implementation [8], 
the 5 GHz band is considered favorable to other unlicensed 
bands. 
C. 6 GHz Unlicensed Band   
The 6 GHz spectrum band is available from 5.925 to 
6.425 GHz in Europe, whereas from 5.925 to 7.125 GHz in 
the USA [23]. Recently, 5.925-6.425 GHz [33] spectrum 
and 5.925 GHz-7.125 GHz spectrum have been proposed, 
respectively, by the EC and the FCC under part 15 rules for 
the unlicensed access [34]-[35]. Hence, the amount of the 
unlicensed spectrum available in Europe is 500 MHz and in 
the USA is 1200 MHz, which can help address the high 
capacity demand of future mobile networks. Since much of 
the 6 GHz band is occupied by some licensed services, such 
as microwave links, fixed satellite systems, and mobile 
services, Automatic Frequency Coordination (AFC) is 
needed by unlicensed users to protect licensed services. 
Unlicensed users are also required to control the transmit 
power and restrict their coverage to indoors [6].   
D. 60 GHz Unlicensed Band     
      The 60 GHz band is considered for the NR-U to provide 
directional 
communications 
using 
beamforming 
to 
overcome propagation constraints [36]-[37]. Due to 
operating Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) in the 60 GHz band, the 
NR-U standard needs to coexist fairly with the WiGig 
standard. The 60 GHz band ranges from 57 GHz to 71 GHz 
[38]. The bandwidth available in the unlicensed 60 GHz 
band is more than that of the aggregate bandwidth of all the 
other unlicensed bands [39]. The minimum available 
bandwidth in a region is more than 3 GHz, and at least 7 
GHz of bandwidth can be used in most regions in the 60 
GHz band in comparison with just about 500 MHz of usable 
bandwidth in the 5 GHz band and less than 85 MHz of 
bandwidth in the 2.4 GHz band in most regions [39]. Due to 
this reason, the 60 GHz band is suited for serving high data 
rate demand in magnitudes of Gbps over short distances. 
III. 
CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES IN THE UNLICENSED 
SPECTRUM BANDS 
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is the first cellular-based 
technology extended with a view to operating in the sub-7 
GHz unlicensed spectrum bands in 2015, whereas NR-U is 
the first cellular-based technology that includes operations 
in the mmWave unlicensed bands [4]-[5]. Hence, since 
cellular technologies in the previous generations, i.e., 
Fourth-Generation (4G) LTE, were not allowed to use 
mmWave bands, two standards of LTE working in the 
unlicensed bands, namely LTE-U and LAA, operate in the 5 
GHz band. However, unlike LTE that operates only in the 5 
GHz unlicensed spectrum, NR-U can operate on multiple 
spectrum bands, including mmWave bands, e.g., sub-7 GHz 
and 60 GHz [4]. Moreover, like LTE, there are a number of 
8

ICSNC 2021 : The Sixteenth International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications

variants of 5G NR-U, including 5G NR-U Standalone 
operating only in an unlicensed spectrum band (e.g., 60 
GHz) and 5G NR-U Anchored operating in both the 
licensed spectrum and the 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum. On 
the other hand, MulteFire is developed by the MulteFire 
Alliance considering a Standalone deployment in the 
unlicensed bands using an LBT-based channel access 
scheme [40]. 
Though existing IEEE and 3GPP-based technologies 
operate in the unlicensed bands on a competitive basis, such 
competition results in convergence to use and develop 
similar features in the radio access in the latest releases and 
amendments [4], e.g., the use of LBT to 3GPP technologies 
developed in line with Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with 
Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) inherent to the IEEE 
802.11 technologies. Table I shows comparisons in terms of 
numerous aspects among 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 
GHz unlicensed spectrum bands. From Table I, it can be 
observed that a total of about 2 GHz unlicensed bandwidth 
is 
available 
below 
7 
GHz 
for 
omnidirectional 
communications at the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands 
[34].  Moreover, a large amount of 9 GHz of spectrum in 
Europe and 14 GHz unlicensed spectrum in the USA is 
available 
in 
the 
60 
GHz 
band 
for 
directional 
communications [41]-[42].  
IV. MAJOR BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES FROM OPERATING 
CELLULAR NETWORKS IN THE UNLICENSED BANDS 
A.  Benefits to Operate in the Unlicensed Bands 
By operating cellular networks such as LTE and NR in 
the unlicensed bands, significant benefits in several aspects 
can be achieved. A few noticeable benefits are discussed in 
the following.  
1)  High capacity, spectral efficiency, and data rates: 
Employing the Carrier Aggregation (CA) technology, along 
with the allocated licensed spectrum to an MNO of a 
cellular network, the unlicensed spectrum can also be used 
to serve user traffic [8]. Due to the addition of the 
unlicensed spectrum, the combined spectrum bandwidth of 
an MNO increases. Moreover, due to the availability of an 
enormous amount of spectrum bandwidth in the 60 GHz 
mmWave band, the aggregate bandwidth of an MNO can be 
increased even further. Since the mmWave spectrum is 
inherently path loss limited, the 60 GHz unlicensed 
spectrum is suitable to use within indoor environments. 
Because the capacity is directly proportional to the available 
channel bandwidth, the use of the unlicensed spectrum in a 
cellular network helps increase its overall capacity, spectral 
efficiency, as well as data rates per user. 
2) Data offloading: Given that small cells operate in 
both the licensed and unlicensed bands, using the CA

technology, an MNO can configure its indoor small cells to 
offload all or a major portion of its user traffic over the 
unlicensed spectrum, whereas to serve its control signals 
over the licensed spectrum, when its user traffic demand is 
high. If, however, indoor small cells of an MNO are not CA 
enabled, in that case, its small cells can serve only the user 
data traffic over the unlicensed spectrum, whereas its 
macrocell can serve the control signals over the licensed 
spectrum, given that proper coordination exists between the 
macrocell and indoor small cells of the MNO. 
3) Cost-efficiency: Spectrum licensing fee is very 
expensive and contributes a great portion to the cost to 
transmit per bit, i.e. cost efficiency, of an MNO. As there is 
no cost from using an unlicensed spectrum, by operating an 
MNO in both the licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands, 
the demand for high capacity and data rates per user of the 
MNO can be served at a low average cost per bit 
transmission, resulting in improving its cost-efficiency.  
B. Challenges to Operate in the Unlicensed Bands 
      Several technical challenges remain unaddressed across 
different layers for the operation of cellular standards (i.e., 
LTE-U, LAA, and NR-U) and IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., 
WiFi and WiGig) in the same unlicensed band. A few 
noticeable challenges are discussed in the following. 
1) Efficient coexistence mechanism: The main challenge 
to operate cellular standards in the unlicensed band comes 
from the design of an efficient coexistence mechanism of 
cellular and IEEE 802.11 standards in the unlicensed band. 
Major constraints to designing an efficient coexistence 
mechanism include the lack of inter-Radio Access 
Technology (RAT) coordination, intercell interference 
management, independent resource allocations from one 
RAT to another, and different Medium Access Control 
(MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) protocols [31].  
2) Physical and MAC layer procedures of cellular and 
IEEE 802.11 technologies: Though 3GPP based cellular and 
IEEE 802.11 technologies use the same Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multiple-
Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques in the physical 
layer, other features, including the transmission power, 
Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), and error 
correction code, are different [48]. Moreover, cellular 
standards use Radio Link Control Layer with Hybrid 
Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ), whereas, WiFi, for 
example, 
uses 
Automatic 
Repeat 
Request 
(ARQ) 
mechanisms, for the recovery of packet losses.  
      Further, in the case of the MAC layer procedure, cellular 
technology is an allocation-based mechanism, whereas an 
IEEE 802.11 (e.g., WiFi) technology is a contention-based 
mechanism. 
Cellular 
technology 
uses 
continuous 
transmission of data in consecutive frames using a 
centralized scheduler. But, a WiFi technology uses 
opportunistic transmission using Distributed Coordination 
Function (DCF). DCF uses the CSMA/CA protocol to 
detect the energy level in order to get access to a channel. 
Due to the CSMA/CA behavior, once WiFi APs gain 
channel access, they occupy the entire bandwidth for a 
certain amount of time. Conversely, in a cellular technology 
such as LTE, the bandwidth is first divided into Resource 
Blocks (RBs), which are then allocated to its users at each 
Transmission Time Interval (TTI) by a centralized scheduler 
[49]. Due to these disparities given above in the MAC layer 
procedures, CCI between a WiFi AP and a cellular node 
occurs when both accessing the same unlicensed spectrum.  
3) Interference management: Since no interference 
management exists between cellular and IEEE 802.11 
standards, and the current LBT does not allow neighboring 
cellular nodes to transmit simultaneously due to employing 
contention-based opportunistic scheduling, no simultaneous 
transmission of cellular and IEEE 802.11 nodes are allowed, 
and hence no reuse of the same unlicensed spectrum 
spatially is possible.  
4) Transmission 
mode: 
Unlike 
licensed 
bands, 
transmissions in unlicensed bands are discontinuous and 
opportunistic, particularly, for cellular standards using LBT 
such as LAA and NR-U, which result in reduced efficiency 
and flexibility in Radio Resource Management (RRM).  
5) Beam-based transmissions: Unlike LTE-U and LAA, 
since NR-U operates as well in the 60 GHz mmWave band 
using beam-based transmissions, LBT used in LAA with 
omnidirectional transmissions needs additional requirements 
to be addressed for the beam-based NR-U. 
V. CONCLUSION 
      This paper has presented an essential survey on 
unlicensed spectrum bands considered for the operation of 
cellular mobile networks. Particularly, both sub-7 GHz (i.e., 
2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) bands and millimeter-wave 
bands (i.e., 60 GHz) proposed for the Fifth-Generation (5G) 
and beyond networks have been discussed. Each unlicensed 
band has been surveyed taking into account the 
classification, operational region, regulatory requirement, 
existing technology, available bandwidth, spectrum range, 
benefit, and challenge. A comparative framework in a 
tabular form has been developed for numerous aspects to 
compare one unlicensed band to another to find an 
appropriate unlicensed spectrum band corresponding to a 
particular aspect. Finally, we have pointed out major 
benefits and challenges to operate cellular networks in 
unlicensed bands.  
This paper can serve as a source of fundamental 
knowledge on unlicensed spectrum bands for cellular 
technologies and be useful for those who aim at working on 
the operation of cellular networks in the unlicensed 
spectrum bands. For more details, interested readers are 
recommended to refer to the existing works cited throughout 
the paper and given in the reference section.
