Abstract— In this paper, we propose optical code division 
multiple access (CDMA) systems using dual encoding with 
different optical power to improve system performance. In 
the proposed system, each user has two signature sequences, 
and an information bit is modulated by the sequences with 
the different power. In the receiver, the received signal is fed 
into optical hard limiter (OHL). The reflected signal and the 
transmitted signal of OHL are decoded by corresponding 
decoders of the sequences, respectively. At each decoder, 
correlation between received sequence and an assigned 
sequence is calculated and then information bit is detected. 
We theoretically derive bit error rate (BER), and show that 
our proposed system can significantly improve BER. 
Keywords-optical code division multiple access(CDMA); 
power control; optical orthogonal codes. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, Optical Code Division Multiple Access 
(CDMA) systems attract much attention particularly in the 
field of fiber optic networks. In optical CDMA systems, 
each user is assigned a unique signature sequence to allow 
multiple accesses. Information bit is modulated by On-Off 
Keying (OOK) signaling, then coded by each encoder, 
which has own signature sequence [1]-[13]. Signals of all 
users are coupled and send to optical fiber network. At the 
receiver, multiplexed signal is fed into a decoder and 
correlated with its sequence. When the correlation value is 
larger than decision threshold, received bit is determined 
as ―1‖, otherwise as ―0.‖ Generally, optical CDMA 
systems suffer from multiple access interferences (MAI) 
from other simultaneous users. In order to decrease MAI, 
signature sequences are constructed so that cross 
correlation is small. Optical Orthogonal Code (OOC) with 
λa = λc = 1  is frequently used, and is discussed on its 
construction methods and its property [1]-[5].  Here, λa is 
the maximum off-peak of auto correlation, and λc is the 
maximum cross correlation. The code length must be long 
to improve the BER, but it reduces bit rate. Increasing 
weight of sequence also improve the BER, however, the 
available number of user decrease. Since OOC with λc = 1 
is restricted in the number of sequence for a given code 
length, OOC with λc  1 is also discussed to increase the 
number of sequence [6]. 
In order to improve the BER, various methods have 
been reported [7]-[9]. In [1], an optical hard limiter (OHL), 
where nonlinear optical effect is used for limiting power of 
optical signal, is placed at the front of the receiver to 
reduce the effect of interference.  
On the other hand, optical CDMA systems using 
different optical power have been also proposed [10]-[12]. 
In [11], users are divided into some groups, and each user 
uses the optical power level assigned to own group, then 
users of different groups can obtain different BER. In 
conventional researches, different optical power is used to 
achieve different requirement on BER in multimedia 
communications or increase the number of user. 
In this paper, we propose an optical CDMA using dual 
encoding with different optical power to improve BER by 
using two levels of optical power by each user.  In the 
proposed system, each user has two signature sequences, 
and an information bit is modulated by the two sequences 
with different power levels. In the receiver, the received 
signal is passed through OHL, and the reflected signal and 
the transmitted signal of OHL are decoded by 
corresponding decoders, respectively. The proposed 
transmitter and receiver can remove MAI between signals 
of different power. Since we can increase the weight of 
sequence without increasing MAI in the same code length,   
the BER is improved. Moreover, we discuss how to assign 
two sequences to each user. By using cyclic shifted 
sequence, we can assign sequences without decreasing the 
number of user. We also derive BER theoretically, and 
show 
the 
proposed 
system 
provides 
significant 
performance improvement.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the transmitter of the 
proposed system. There are N simultaneous users and each 
have two encoders that are assigned different sequences. 
We use OOC, whose code length and number of weights 
are F and k, respectively. Here, the two sequences of user i 
is denoted by Ci,1  and Ci,2, respectively. An information 
bit is coded by both encoder 1 with Ci,1  and encoder 2 
with Ci,2. The output of the encoder 1 and encoder 2 are 
modulated by optical power P and 2P, respectively.

Signals of the same power from all transmitters are once 
coupled at the coupler, and are fed into OHLs with 
threshold P and 2P only to transmit the minimum optical 
signal to reduce interference. The output signal power Itr of 
the OHL for input x is given by [13]

where th is the output threshold of the OHL, and given by 
P and 2P, respectively. The outputs of two OHLs are 
coupled by the coupler and the output of the coupler is sent 
to optical fiber networks. The output of the coupler 
consists of signals of power P, 2P and 3P, which are single 
sum of power P and 2P.  
Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of the receiver of the 
proposed system.  The received signal is fed into OHL 
with threshold 2P. The output of OHL consists of reflected 
signal and transmitted signal. TABLE 1 shows intensity of 
transmitted signal and reflected signal for the received 
signal. Thus, encoded signals by the encoder 1 and 2 
appear at the output as the transmitted signal and the 
reflected signal at the output of OHL, respectively. 
Decoder 1 with the sequence Ci,1 decodes the sequence 
coded by encoder 1 modulated with P, and also, decoder 2 
with the signature Ci,2 decodes the sequence coded by 
encoder 2 modulated with 2P. Namely, two signals 
modulated by the different power do not interfere with 
each other. At the each decoder, when the correlation with 
the corresponding sequence is larger than the threshold k, 
which is the weight of the sequence, the output of decoders 
is ―1‖. In the case of both outputs of two decoders are ―1‖, 
received bit is determined as ―1‖, otherwise as ―0‖. 
III. 
CODE CONSTRUCTION 
In this section, we explain construction method of the 
sequence. Ci,1 is OOC with λa = λc = 1 generated by 
Greedy algorithm [4]. Ci,2 is given by cyclic shift of Ci,1 
by Si. Then, the element of the sequence is Ci,2 (n) = Ci,1 
(n   Si), (0 < n < F-1), where Ci,1 (n) denotes nth bit of 
the sequence of 0 or 1 and ―  ‖ denotes modulo-F 
addition. Ci,1 and Ci,2 are used in the same users and 
transmitted synchronously, so we can use cyclic shifted

sequence code of Ci,1 as Ci,2. Thus, although the proposed 
system requires two sequence codes for each user, we can 
assign sequence codes without decreasing the number of 
users. Since there are no interferences between signals of 
different power, maximum value of cross correlation 
between sequences of same power is 1. However, we 
should consider the case that Ci,1 and Ci,2 are interfered 
simultaneously from one user. Thus, we define cross 
correlation between sequences of user Ci,1 and Ci,2  to 
determine Si. Considering that Ci,1 and Ci,2 are used 
synchronously, the cross correlation can be expressed as

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
In this section, we derive the BER of the proposed 
system. To investigate the basic performance of the 
proposed system, we do not consider any noise in this 
analysis and we only consider MAI to corrupt signal. We 
assume that only sequences satisfying

A bit error occurs when desired user sends ―0‖ and both of 
correlation values of two decoders exceed a decision 
threshold simultaneously. The probability q that a pulse

user is given by

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
Figs. 4 and 5 show the BER given by (4), and 
simulation. We use OOC with F = 464, k = 4 in Fig. 4, and 
OOC with F = 127, k = 3 in Fig. 5. In both figures, when N 
is smaller than number of sequence in TABLE 2, 
simulation value is almost equal with theoretical value. 
The BER is slightly degraded when N is large, because (4) 
is on the assumption that all sequence is satisfy

as in TABLE 3, and the degradation can be ignored. 
Fig. 6 shows the BER of the proposed system given by 
(4) versus the number of users N for F = 620, k = 4 
together with conventional system. As the conventional 
system, we assume the optical CDMA system using OOC 
having the same parameter and placing OHL in front of 
receivers [5]. In order to keep BER less than 10-8, the 
conventional system can accommodate only 5 users, but 
our proposed system can accommodate 40 users.  
Fig. 7 shows BER versus the number of users for 
proposed system for F = 890, k=5 together with 
conventional system. In case of N=30, BER of 
conventional system is 10-6, while BER of the proposed 
system achieves 10-12.

to improve system performance. Each user has two 
signature sequences, and an information bit is modulated 
by these sequences with different power levels. By using 
the proposed transmitter and receiver, there are no 
interferences between signals of different power. We 
show construction method of sequence so that the 
maximum value of cross correlation is small. We also 
derive BER theoretically. As a result, it is shown that our 
proposed systems significantly improve the performance 
of optical CDMA systems.
