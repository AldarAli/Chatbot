Abstract—The paper considers an approach for monitoring the 
state of elements of multi-service communication networks, 
based on application of fuzzy logical inference. The proposed 
approach can be implemented to design the systems for 
operative support of decision making in multi-service 
communication networks. The results of numerical simulation 
of the proposed method are analyzed, which showed that the 
method has high efficiency. 
Keywords- network monitoring; multi-service communication 
networks; fuzzy logical inference.

 INTRODUCTION  
Multi-service network (MSN) belongs to the class of big 
complex 
heterogeneous 
hierarchical 
geographically 
distributed systems. For such systems, the functional 
characteristics defining the reliability are some of the main 
characteristics [1]. With the growing size of networks, 
complexity of equipment and the extension of their 
functionality, the responsibilities of network administrators 
for the correctness and validity of decisions made for 
network effective management significantly increased. 
Network administrators, which determine the quality and 
reliability of MSN, as a rule, have sufficiently small time 
resource to make analysis of the current situation and 
develop management solutions to minimize the number of 
errors when making decisions on elimination of arising faults 
or failures in the network equipment. In addition, they have 
to make decisions in conditions of incomplete information 
about the technical state of the network elements. All this 
leads to discrepancy between physical and functional 
possibilities of the operator, and to the increasing complexity 
of the tasks that need to be solved to maintain the network in 
workable state. In this regard, the development and 
implementation of an intelligent operational decision-making 
system (ODMS) for monitoring and diagnostics of technical 
state of MSN elements is an actual scientific problem.  
As an example, Table 1 shows the main managed 
parameters, which determine the quality of MSN services. 
Table I shows the diversity of the basic MSN parameters to 
be managed, their different physical nature, as well as 
different scales of their measurement. All this determines 
the complexity of solving the problem of monitoring the 
state of network elements (NEs) using traditional methods.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for the 
monitoring of the NE state in MSN, based on application of 
the fuzzy logical inference. The necessity of usage of fuzzy 
data processing methods in the proposed approach is caused 
by the following factors: (1) uncertainty of the reasons that 
can result in failures of nodes and communication channels; 
(2) incomplete information about the NE state and MSN as 
a whole, which is subject to processing; (3) delay for 
transmission of the NE state data to the processing nodes. 
Theoretical contributions and novelties of the paper are as 
follows: (1) the mechanism of fuzzy logical inference on NE 
states with hierarchical structure is proposed; (2) an 
approach based on the use of intelligent agents for decision 
making is suggested; (3) an algorithm for fuzzy models 
training that does not require significant computing 
resources is offered.  
Further structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 
specifies the problem of the operational monitoring of the 
NE state in MSN. Section 3 discusses the results of relevant 
works. Section 4 considers the method for assessment of NE 
states in MSN. Section 5 shows and analyzes the results of 
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach. Section 6 
contains the main conclusions and directions for further 
research.

PROBLEM STATEMENT  
The process of functioning of NEs of MSN can be 
represented as a sequence of time intervals of workable

states and outages, including failures and recovery 
(Figure 1). The duration of these intervals is determined by 
various factors. The following notations are used in Figure 1:

Reliability of NE of MSN is defined as the probability of 
existing of NE in a workable state in the conditions of 
failures. It is equal to the mathematical expectation of time 
during which the NE is in workable state. This definition is 
equivalent to the concept of the coefficient of availability 
Ka. In this case, the following expression is true:

where tdet is the time of detection of deviation from 
normative functioning mode; tev is the time of  estimation of 
the new situation relatively to the state of the controlled NE; 
tdes is the time of elaboration and making decision; tex is the 
time of decision realization.  
Thus, the task of the decision-making support (DMS) 
system is in production of such decision, in which the 
condition (6) is met. The time of decision realization is 
determined by the technical characteristics of the operations 
support subsystem (OSS). This time does not depend on 
DMS characteristics.

RELATED WORK 
Currently, the NE state monitoring is based on the 
concept of "agent – manager", which is described in details 
in [2]-[6]. According to this concept, the agent pre-
accumulates information about the current NE state, and then 
sends it to the manager. The manager, in its turn, provides it 
in a convenient form to the network administrator. This 
approach implements the paradigm of "detection – 
informing". The MSN is controlled by the network 
administrator. 
Known 
and 
practically 
implemented 
approaches to the NE state monitoring are based on the 
statistical methods [7].  
In some papers to reduce the a priori uncertainty and 
decrease the reaction time to change the NE state, it is 
proposed to use intelligent techniques [8]-[12]. On their basis 
it is possible to realize the paradigm of "from the state 
detection to decision". In a number of papers, it is proposed 
to use neural networks for network state monitoring [13][14]. 
Kasabov et al. [15] suggest a dynamic evolutionary fuzzy 
logic system that implements adaptive training in a near real 
time. However, it should be noted that, given the diversity of 
estimated parameters, in the known papers on the NE state 
monitoring insufficient attention is paid to the DMS 
elements that are implementing the methods for making 
optimal and rational decisions. At the same time, the 
experience of using the mechanisms of fuzzy inference for 
making decisions to identify anomalous behavior and 
manage the security risks in the MSN, given in [16][17], 
allows to assert about appropriateness of its use for the NE 
state monitoring.  
IV. 
ASSESSMENT OF THE NETWORK ELEMENT STATE 
Let us assume that after the block of fuzzification of the 
Mamdani fuzzy inference machine the input variables, 
characterizing the NE state in MSN, take the form of 
linguistic input variables and are defined as follows: 

,
,

where x is variable's name; T is term-set, each element of 
which is determined by the fuzzy set on universal set U;  
G is syntactic rules, generating the membership functions of 
terms' names; M is semantic rules, determining the 
membership rules on fuzzy terms, generated by the syntactic 
rules from G.  
Fuzzy logical inference for generation of estimations of 
situations of the NE state in MSN based on the Mamdani 
fuzzy inference has the following form [9][10]:

where aij is a fuzzy term, by which the variable xi

weight coefficients for each j-th rule of the knowledge base 
(wj  1); 
j
  is logical operation, connecting premises in j-th 
rule of the knowledge base.  
In the expression (8), all values of input and output 
variables are represented by fuzzy sets. We introduce the 
following membership functions:

are done.  
As the result of the defuzzification of the fuzzy set Y 
(which can be done, for example, using the method of 
determining the gravity center), the exact value of output y is 
turned out. Summarizing the above results, to assess the 
current state of the NE it is proposed to implement in DMS 
the mechanism of fuzzy inference with two-level hierarchical 
structure that is represented in Figure 2. In the given 
structure, the number of levels is conditional and can be 
modified when solving a specific task. Each hierarchical 
level comprises the machines of fuzzy inference. The 
particularity of this structure is the lack of intermediate 
operations of defuzzification and fuzzification. These 
operations are fulfilled on the DMS input and output. For 
each group of controlled functional parameters, defining the 
NE state, the features vectors {Xi} arrive on the inputs of the 
fuzzy logical inference machines of the first level of the 
hierarchy.

Figure 2.  The structure of the mechanism of fuzzy logical inference. 
At the output of the hierarchical layer a set of fuzzy 
assessments of the situation {Si} of the NE state for each 
functional group of parameters is formed. These estimates 
are aggregated on the second level of the hierarchy.  
Figure 3 shows a variant of the hierarchical structure of 
the process of the NE state assessment based on cluster 
analysis. This structure can be used for a large number of 
input variables, characterizing the NE technical state, and 
implements a hierarchy of methods of fuzzy cluster analysis 
with subsequent classification of the obtained results.  
The structure of the classifier corresponds to the 
considered structure  of  the  fuzzy  logical  inference system.

It is advisable to choose as the main clustering techniques: 
(1) the method of fuzzy k–means if the number of clusters is 
known a priori; (2) subtractive clustering methods, if a priori 
the number of clusters is unknown.

resistances of interfaces), the current operating temperature 
of the processor module, the number of software faults per 
time unit, etc. 
There are two variants of decision-making: 
1. The decision is made by the intelligent agent (IA) 
exactly at NE itself, and the higher control level, such as 
network administrator, is only notified about the decision 
made. This is possible if such rights are delegated to by the 
higher level.

2. The solution, as in the first case, made by IA itself, 
but is acknowledged and can be corrected by a higher 
control level taking into account its preferences.  
It should be noted that the proposed DMS inherits the 
features of multi-agent systems. These include the following 
properties:  
1. Adaptation. The agents adapt to the network 
architecture and adequately respond to changes in the 
network equipment configuration.  
2. Rationality of resource allocation. IAs are evenly 
distributed across all the NEs in the MSN that allows to 
rationally (optimally) allocate computing resources.  
3. Fault tolerance. At failure of one IA a part of its 
functions can be taken by other IAs. 
4. Ensuring a high degree of information security. The 
security subsystem does not have the dedicated control 
center (decision-making center), as the agents are evenly 
distributed throughout the system, therefore it is more 
difficult to attack the MSN than a network with 
a centralized security server. Distributed over the network 
information and distributed protection require the attacker to 
attack many sites at the same time.  
5. The possibility of centralized control. Introducing 
changes into agents' work can be performed centrally and by 
agent interaction protocols be transferred to any point.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
For numerical simulation, an NE "router" was chosen as 
an example. The structure of the intelligent agent for NE 
"router" state assessment is outlined in Figure 5. In the 
numerical experiment, the NE state was estimated according 
to the following functional parameters:  
1. Electrical parameters: power; active resistance of 
interfaces; attenuation of communication lines to which the 
interfaces are connected.  
2. Performance: processor unit performance; switching 
module performance; state of memory buffers.

3. State of software: state of the database management 
system; software state; number of failures of the software 
and the operating system.  
We denote the estimates for each such group of 
parameters as S1, S2, and S3, respectively. Numerical 
simulation was carried out in MATLAB R 2014b.

Figure 5.  The structure of the intelligent agent. 
Figure 6 represents the characteristics of the fuzzy 
inference system for evaluation of the fuzzy situation using 
the NE electrical parameters. Figure 6-a shows the 
membership functions for the "power" parameter. When 
forming this function, it was assumed that a supply voltage 
equal to 10 V 5% is considered normal. Deviations of +10% 
and -15% are considered as the maximum permissible. 
Values exceeding these values are considered as failures. 
Similarly, the membership functions for "attenuation" 
parameter, shown in Figure 6-b, are constructed. It was 
believed that the signal attenuation corresponds to the norm, 
if it does not exceed 5-6 dB. Attenuation equal to 8-11 dB is 
considered acceptable. If the attenuation exceeds 12 dB, 
then a failure is fixed, since the router will not perform its 
functions. The approach to building the membership 
functions for "resistance of interfaces" parameter (Figure 6-
c) is similar to the approach discussed above. The 
membership functions for the fuzzy situation value S1 are 
shown in Figure 6-d. These functions perform the 
aggregation of the membership functions of the individual 
parameters belonging to group 1, and characterize three 
states – "normal", "acceptable" and "failure". Figure 6-e and 
Figure 6-f show sections of the multidimensional function 
S1 for possible pairs of separate parameters: "power-
attenuation" 
and 
"power-resistance 
of 
interfaces", 
respectively.

using the NE electrical parameters. 
Figure 7 depicts the characteristics of the fuzzy inference 
system to evaluate the fuzzy situation using the NE 
software, and Figure 8 shows the characteristics of the fuzzy 
inference system to evaluate the fuzzy situation.  
The construction of membership functions for these 
functional groups is similar to the first functional group. 
Without loss of generality, in this computational experiment 
all the membership functions are represented by trapezoidal 
functions. This is due to the simplicity of their practical 
implementation. The conducted studies confirm their 
acceptable approximation properties [16][17]. Numerical 
modeling of the functioning of the intelligent agent was 
carried out by the Monte Carlo method with a given 
probability and methods of generating random processes 
with given statistical characteristics. These events and 
random processes simulated the numerical, functional, 
logical and linguistic data of the sensors arriving at the input 
of the intelligent agent for each monitored functional group 
of the router. The results of computational evaluation for 
common fuzzy situation Stotal concerning the NE state are 
represented in table II. The rows of the table correspond to 
possible combinations of estimates of fuzzy situations for 
individual groups of functional elements.  
One of the problems, solved by development and 
implementation of this class DMS, is the task of preliminary 
training.

Figure 9.  Training algorithm of fuzzy model. 
In the second step, the results of fuzzy inference 
procedures are formed on the basis of training samples of 
the source data. In this case, the input training samples can 
be either numerical or linguistic variables. In the third step, 
the functional of the degree of accuracy is formed. In the 
overwhelming majority of cases, this functional belongs to 
the class of quadratic functionals. In the fourth step, an 
iterative gradient procedure is performed, which allows to 
optimize the membership functions for the corresponding 
parameters of the fuzzy inference mechanism. In the final 
fifth stage, the accuracy of the fuzzy inference system is 
checked. If this accuracy is acceptable, then the algorithm is 
completed. If not, it returns to step 4.  
The main characteristics and properties of the training 
algorithm of fuzzy model are as follows: the amount of 
training samples is much less than the amount of data to 
compute the sufficient statistics used in statistical methods 
to ensure the same given accuracy; easy implementation of 
the algorithm; implementation of this algorithm does not 
require significant computing resources; the convergence of 
this algorithm is provided in approximately 5-17 iterations; 
despite the fact that this algorithm belongs to the class of 
algorithms of preliminary training, it can be applied also for 
training of fuzzy inference systems and their operation.  The 
data, obtained in the numerical experiments, indicate high 
efficiency of the proposed methods of the NE state

assessment based on the model of the intelligent agent and 
the mechanism of logical inference. The duration of the 
final NE status assessment in all cases was in the range from 
100 to 150 msec. The duration of the final NE status 
assessment in all cases was in the range from 100 to 150 
msec. The calculations were performed on a personal 
computer of a typical configuration (Intel Xeon 4x2 GHz 
CPU Cores, 2 GByte). In traditional statistical approaches 
(considered in [2]-[7]) this duration is related with 
calculation of correlation dependences. Its value lies 
between 5 to 30 seconds depending on the composition of 
the initial data used. Comparison of the obtained duration 
estimate with the estimate performed according to the 
traditional approaches shows a gain of 50 to 180 times. 
Proceeding from expressions (3) and (6), the decrease of the 
duration of the final NE status assessment leads to decrease 
the NE recovery time and increase the coefficient of 
availability respectively from 0.9-0.95 to 0.95-0.99. Thus, 
the method proposed allows to increase the MSN reliability 
significantly. The accuracy of the final NE status 
assessment for numerical parameters was not less than 0.95. 
For symbolic parameters, in all cases, the accuracy was 1.0. 
For comparison, with the statistical approach, the accuracy 
for numerical parameters lies in the range from 0.9 to 0.97, 
and for symbolic values the statistical estimate generally 
loses its meaning. Thus, this conclusion is justified by the 
following 
factors: 
the 
high 
completeness 
of 
the 
representation of heterogeneous primary information about 
the NE state, which is then analyzed and aggregated; the 
possibility of learning and self-learning of intelligent agents; 
the possibility of organizing parallel computational 
procedures for evaluating the state of NE, which provides 
the possibility of its operation in real time; high accuracy of 
NE state estimation; the ability to quickly track various 
failures and short-term violations in the operation of NE 
hardware and software; the absence of the need to collect 
and process various statistical data on the functioning of the 
NEs. In addition, the use of intelligent agents in conjunction 
with the developed methods and algorithms ensures to 
implement the principle of self-organization when providing 
and restoring the specified state of MSN as a whole.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION  
On the basis of the analysis of the methods for ensuring 
the MSN reliability, the task of the operational monitoring of 
the NE state was formulated. Using the proposed mechanism 
for fuzzy hierarchical inference the algorithm for operational 
monitoring of the NE state was developed. Analysis of the 
results of the experimental evaluation of the developed 
algorithm in comparison with the statistical approach has 
shown its higher speed and accuracy for NE state estimation, 
as well as the possibility of predicting its further state. All 
this allows us to speak about the high efficiency of the 
proposed approach for monitoring of the NE state in MSN. 
The future research is associated with the use of fuzzy 
inference for making decisions on MSN control.
