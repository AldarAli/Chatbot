Abstract—This paper describes an agent that can facilitate 
first meeting communications. In this situation, a communica-
tion mediator is important because people can feel stress and 
an inability to talk comfortably. Our agent reduces this stress 
using embodied entrainment and promoting communication. 
In previous research into embodied entrainment, appropriate 
back-channel feedback has been discussed but communication 
studies have been limited. We propose an embodied entrain-
ment control system that recognizes a state of communication 
and is adaptive to each situation with effective nonverbal 
communication. In this way, our agent mediates a balanced, 
two-way conversation. Our experiments with the agent con-
firmed its effectiveness across various social skills levels. We 
demonstrate that the embodied entrainment of our agent in 
first meetings benefits people who have low social skills, there-
by verifying the efficacy of our agent.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Wider communication capabilities are required for robots 
to support humans’ daily life. In today’s world, it is not 
enough to have a simple relationship between a human and a 
robot; if robots are to support daily life, we need to develop 
true socialized robots.  
We propose a robot design that can mediate a smooth 
group conversation and encourage human communication. 
Humans communicate with each other via many channels 
that can be categorized as verbal and nonverbal. Nonverbal 
communication channels such as intonation, accent, eye-
contact, gestures such as nodding or other emotional expres-
sions all encourage synchronization, embodied entrainment, 
and friendship [1]–[7]. Watanabe et al. [8] have investigated 
such a robotic agent, which includes embodied entrainment, 
and they developed a speech-driven interactive actor, the 
Inter Actor, which can predict appropriate timing of nods and 
gestures with voice information from a communication part-
ner.  
However, the Inter Actor focused on synchronization 
with a listener without regard to group communication that 
involves both the talker and listener in a balanced, two-way 
conversation. Kanda et al. [9], [10] adopted a joint gaze 
function for their robot and have investigated a more adap-
tive robot through a design-based approach. However, the 
research focused on rule-based natural behavior of robots 
rather than a robot design aiming to facilitate communication. 
In addition, the investigation did not mention group commu-
nication.  
This paper focuses on group communication and presents 
a control method of embodied entrainment that is adaptive to 
the situation.  
We begin with an introducer robot for communication 
between persons meeting for the first time (Fig. 1). Next, we 
explain our method for adaptive control of embodied en-
trainment and show the experimental results that verify the 
basic effectiveness of our agent. Finally, we analyze our 
agent's effectiveness from the viewpoint of social skills.

A. Utterances inducement 
The agent asks questions related to the participants in or-
der to establish a mutual relationship between itself and each 
participant. 
B.  Gaze Leading 
For transmission of information from participant A to 
participant B, the agent moves its gaze to A and asks him/her 
about the information. Then, the agent moves its gaze from 
A to B in order to achieve an equal eye-contact. 
C. Gaze Distribution and Synchronizing Nod 
When the participants talk to each other, the agent makes 
equal eye-contact with the participants and adjusts its nod 
timing to those of the participants’.  
D. Dynamically Synchronizing 
The synchronizing method is dynamically changed ac-
cording to the state of the two participants as follows. 
1) Natural synchronizing to a listener. 
When a listener synchronizes with a talker by nodding 
and other back-channel feedback, the agent echoes these 
according to the listener’s timing to encourage further com-
munication. 
2) Synchronizing to a talker to invite the other 
participant to the conversation. 
When a listener does not listen to the talker, the agent 
tunes its back-channel feedback rhythm to that of the talker 
and makes eye-contact with the listener. By this behavior, 
the agent influences the listener and encourages flow of the 
conversation. 
Fig. 2 shows the strategy details. Note that the symbols in 
the figure represent communication members as follows.

III. 
ADAPTIVE CONTROL OF EMBODIED ENTRAINMENT 
A.  Macro Strategy to Promote Group Conversation 
These behaviors must be executed in a conversational 
situation; therefore, we modeled the group communication 
on a first-time meeting and designed a macro strategy for 
the promotion of conversation. Fig. 3 describes the strategy 
and state transition model. The strategy consists of the 
grounding and enhancement processes on the top layer of 
the figure. The grounding process establishes a rapport and 
enhancement process promotes communications within the 
group. The bottom layer of Fig. 3 shows the state transition 
model. We segmented an introduction scene into five states 
on the basis of preliminary observations. The agent moves 
among these states according to the circumstances of the 
participants’ communication as follows: 
1)  Greeting 
The agent introduces itself and offers a brief explanation 
of the situation. Then, it introduces the participants’ names. 
2) Grounding 
In this state, the agent tries to establish a relationship be-
tween itself and each participant. For this, the agent cites the 
participants’ profiles and asks them simple questions. It 
aims to encourage them into the rhythm of the agent using 
utterance inducement. It is assumed that the agent has data 
such as name, hobbies, or other details of the participants 
who are being introduced. 
3) Topic Offering 
This state encourages conversation between the parti-
cipants. The agent offers information and profiles of one 
participant to the other or asks a simple question in order to 
start a conversation between them. By such behavior, the 
agent manipulates the participants’ gaze to make them 
communicate face to face. 
4) Focusing on a Specified Topic 
In this state, the agent tries to join in a conversation be-
tween the participants. The agent focuses on a topic that was 
offered at the previous state, Topic Offering. 
5) Hearing Conversations

tionship between the participants, the agent keeps hearing

their conversations quietly. In this state, the agent nods and 
looks at the talker using basic embodied entrainment strate-
gies with correct timing. 
 
B. Communication Activity 
The agent monitors the participants’ communication and 
estimates the current state as shown in Fig. 3. For the esti-
mation, we define communication activity measurement. 
The agent calculates the activity in every time slice, defined 
by the average of speech level and mutual eye-contact of the 
participants. When this measurement satisfies the condition 
of a state transition, the agent moves to the next state. To 
explain this, we define the essential actions of communica-
tion by the following symbols that represent functions 
which return 1 when each action is detected by sensors. 
Otherwise, they return 0. Henceforth, the parameter t always 
denotes the time when the actions occur. 
 
 
Nod (X, t)  
X nods 
 
Utterance (X, t)  
X talks 
 
Utterance (X  rancewhen t 
X talks to Y 
 
Terminate Utterance (X, t)   
X terminates his/her 
speech.

X directs his/her gaze 
to Y

X looks toward Y

X’s gaze accords to 
Y’s 
 
Face (X ⇔ Y, t) 
X and Y look toward 
each other 
 
Turn Gaze (R, X azeook  
The agent guides X’s 
gaze toward Y  
 
Turn Utterance (R, X tter-
ancee 
R encourages X to 
talk to Y 
          
Note that, in this paper: 
Gaze (X → Y, t) = Face (X → Y, t)  and 
Gaze (X ⇔ Y, t) = Face (X ⇔ Y, t) 
 
Our method calculates the communication activity using 
these symbols and is based on the following two equations: 
1) Ratio of gaze sharing 
 
          (      )

           (     )

 ∑
       𝑈   𝑟 𝑛𝑐 𝑃𝑜𝑤 𝑟(   )
      
  
+ 𝑃𝑛 
(2) 
 
 
Note that, Pu (x, t) represents the power of x’s utterance 
at the time t. Pn is a term of environmental noise. The fol-
lowing equation is an extended formula to calculate the av-
erage Pu of multiple participants.  
 
 
𝐴𝑣 𝑟 𝑔 𝑃𝑢(      )
 ∑
        𝑣 𝑟 𝑔 {𝑃𝑢(   ) 𝑃𝑢(   )}
      
  
    +   𝑃𝑛 
(3) 
 
Note that ∆t is a time span for calculation of the meas-
urement. 
Conditions of state transitions depend on the communi-
cation activity and are defined as follows. 
 
1)  From Greeting, Grounding to Topic Offering 
In these states, the agent behaves according to the pre-
scribed action scenario that is composed of general proto-
cols of greeting and introduction. 
2) From Topic Offering to Focusing the Topic 
 
          (      )    𝑟   𝑜

3) From Focusing the Topic to Hearing Conversation

and  
𝐴𝑣 𝑟 𝑔 𝑃𝑢(      )    𝑟   𝑜  𝑢     
(5) 
 
In the equations, both the thresholdgaze and thresholdutter 
are acquired through learning. 
C. Learning for Adaptive Control of Embodied Entrainment 
The agent retrieves participants’ information by sensors 
and determines its course of action to encourage entrain-
ment. We built a decision tree (Fig. 4) of inductive learning 
for this interaction. The following three rules are extracted 
from the tree.

1)  Rule #1-Reactive nodding 
This rule represents reactive nodding to a participant’s 
nod.  
2)  Rule #2-An utterance 
When one participant has finished speaking and the oth-
er participant stays quiet, it can be assumed that the conver-
sation is over. The agent recognizes this situation and offers 
a topic to avoid any silence. 
3)  Rule #3-An utterance and nod to a participant’s 
speech 
This rule is very similar to Rule #2 but represents the 
situation where a participant stops speaking before finishing. 
In this situation, the agent is 70% likely to interject and 30% 
likely to nod. The criteria to determine whether a participant 
has finished speaking depends on the final part of the utter-
ance. We extract the final part by Japanese morphological 
analysis. 
 
IV. 
BASIC EFFECTIVENESS OF A FIRST MEETING 
INTRODUCER AGENT 
 Our aim is to promote exchange of information in in-
troductory meetings and we conducted our experiment using 
an agent to mediate between strangers. 
To validate the communication model in first-time meet-
ings, one experiment explored communication between an 
agent and two strangers (condition with an agent), and the 
second experiment explored communication between two 
strangers (condition without an agent). To eliminate poten-
tial problems such as hearing difficulties, we excluded el-
derly participants from these experiments. 
 Fig. 5 shows our sensing environment allowing real-
time gaze tracking of the strangers using multiple cameras 
(Figs. 5 (e)–(f)). A virtual agent is shown in the display used 
for this experiment ((Fig. 5 (g)). Fig. 6 shows our virtual 
agent. An acceleration sensor that was attached to partici-
pants detects gestures, whereas a microphone detects their 
speech (Fig. 7).  
 
Experimental participants included 10 pairs of 
strangers, who were all university students.  
 From results of previous experiments, the time of this 
experiment was set to 6 min. In this experiment, topics of-
fered by the agent included information about each stranger 
such as hobbies and special skills.

Table 1 shows a statistical summary of the questionnaire 
that included questions such as “Was the conversation stim-
ulating?”, “Did you feel comfortable with your partner?”, 
and “Did you come to know your partner well?”. Answers 
were evaluated between 1 (the worst) and 5 (the best).

tions 2 and 3. 
 This validates the efficacy of our model for mediating 
first meetings. 
 
V. ANALYSIS OF AGENT FROM A VIEWPOINT OF SOCIAL 
SKILL 
We examined the role of the agent’s mediating behav-
iors with regard to participants’ social skills, having already 
verified the basic effectiveness of the five mediating behav-
iors previously mentioned. 
In this section, we hypothesize that embodied entrain-
ment in mediating behaviors does not affect people with 
high social skills, but is effective for people with low social 
skills. Our experiments verify this. 
People with low social skills often mistime speech, 
while people with high social skills risk monopolizing the 
conversation. We considered that our five mediating behav-
iors of utterance inducement, gaze leading, gaze distribution, 
synchronizing to a listener, and synchronizing to a talker are 
effective communication methods to defuse these situations 
for people with low social skills.  
This experiment was conducted with pairs of strangers 
and an introducer agent and in conditions of with and with-
out gaze sharing and nodding. In our previous experiment, 
the subjects were university students. In this test, we used 
elderly people in order to verify applicability of communi-
cation support in geriatric care as communication support 
for people with low social skills. The number of participants 
was 38 that included 18 elderly men and 20 elderly women.  
The experimental environment was the same as the pre-
vious experiment, but this time, we used a real robotic agent 
for a more effective embodied entrainment than a virtual 
agent (Fig. 9). 
 
 
 
Figure 9. 
Robotic introducer agent. 
 
  
We conducted a questionnaire before the experiment and 
inputted the information obtained to an introducer agent. We 
explain robot’s mediating behaviors to two experimental 
participants and we shows questionnaire item in monitor to 
participants.  
Each participant completed KiSS-18 for classification 
into groups of high and low social skills. Table 2 shows 
statistical summary of participants’ social skills.

PARTICIPANTS'

SKILL  
 
 
Table 3 shows the national average of social skill [11]. 
TABLE 3.

After the experiment, the participants answered a ques-
tionnaire about the experiment with gestures and that with-
out gestures. We conducted a t-test on the questionnaire 
with the results shown in Table 4.  
 
TABLE 4. 
RESULTS OF THE T-TEST 
 
 
As shown by the t-test results, groups of high social 
skills cannot verify the efficacy of the agent either with or 
without gestures. However, groups with low social skills 
can verify the efficacy of an agent with and without gestures.  
This result means that participants who have low social 
skills gain more from the five mediating behaviors. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Our agent could change a state of communication such 
as Topic Offering and Focusing and Hearing on the basis of 
the communication activity measurement, which is calculat-
ed from mutual eye-contact and utterance power. On the 
basis of this state transition, we could stimulate communica-
tion through body entrainment behaviors such as nodding, 
eye-contact, and other back-channel feedback pertinent to 
each communication state. We conducted communication 
experiments between strangers and confirmed the effective-
ness of adaptive state transitions and smooth interaction 
control. Our questionnaire confirmed that our agent could 
promote understanding between the communication pairs. 
From the evaluation, it is supposed that our system could 
deal with a stressful situation between strangers. 
 We aim to adapt our agent to promote information ex-
change between elderly strangers. For this, we conducted 
experiments in conditions of with and without gaze sharing 
and nodding.

From our results, we confirm the efficacy of our agent 
using gestures in groups with low social skills to encourage 
conversation between participants and demonstrate that the 
five mediating behaviors work effectively for participants 
with low social skills.
