I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
There is a growing need of economic online and in-situ 
field analysis applications like online monitoring of volatile 
components in chemical and biochemical processes, quality 
monitoring in food processing, discriminated monitoring of 
toxic gas leakages, etc. In the last application, it is often 
necessary to find and locate the source of the leakage. In this 
context, isothermally operated metal oxide gas sensors 
(MOGs) with tin oxide as base material are manifold 
introduced due to their high sensitivity, long-term stability 
and low price. Their sensitivity to specific gas components, 
however, cannot be cultivated with high discrimination to 
others. Therefore, other approaches are necessary like a multi 
gas sensor array of MOGs [1][2] or thermo-cyclic operation 
of the MOG.  
For evaluation of the sensor data, powerful mathematical 
evaluation procedures for substance identification and 
concentration determination, even in the case of variable 
environmental conditions like varying humidity, are 
necessary. The calibration of sensor elements is very time 
consuming and expensive. Even sensor elements which are 
fabricated batch-wise have to be individually calibrated for 
good 
analysis 
performance. 
Therefore, 
economic 
mathematical calibration procedures are useful to reduce the 
costs and the scope of calibration measurements. Last but not 
least, mathematical procedures are needed to locate the 
source of a leakage. 
At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) 
mathematical procedures are developed to meet the above 
mentioned requirements: ProSens – a mathematical 
procedure for calibration and evaluation, ProCal – a 
mathematical procedure for batch-wise calibration of sensor 
elements and ProSource – a mathematical procedure to 
locate the source of a leakage. After some remarks to 
thermo-cyclic operation of the MOG, these procedures will 
be briefly described in this paper and their performance will 
be demonstrated in applications with real data. 
In Section 2, the principles of thermo-cyclic operation are 
briefly discussed. A short outline of the program ProSens 
with two applications to real data is given in Section 3. In 
Section 4, the program ProCal is briefly introduced and its 
performance is demonstrated in an example. In Section 5, the 
program ProSource for source localization is briefly 
described and in Section 6, the results of the paper are 
summarized.  
II. 
THERMO-CYCLIC OPERATION 
Thermo-cyclic operation means, that the working 
temperature of the sensor element is periodically increased 
and decreased over the time in a triangular shape. 
Simultaneous sampling of the conductance values over the 
time leads to so-called Conductance over Time Profiles 
(CTP) [3][4][5]. These profiles give a fingerprint of the 
surface processes with the gas and represent the gas mixture 
under consideration. The gas specific features of the CTPs 
can be used for component identification and concentration 
determination.

Figure 2. CTPs of some gases at a certain concentration level 
 
Figure 1 shows the CTPs of dimethyl sulphate (DMS) at 
various concentration levels with the characteristic shape. 
The working temperature of the sensor element is in the 
range of 100 to 400 degree Celsius. The conductance values 
are recorded only over the growing part of the triangular 
shape.  
Figure 2 shows the CTPs of some gases at a certain 
concentration level. It can be seen that the shapes of the 
various gases are quite different. Therefore, they can be used 
for substance identification using innovative calibration and 
evaluation procedures.  
   
III. 
PROSENS – A MATHEMATICAL PROCEDURE FOR 
CALIBRATION AND EVALUATION 
As mentioned above, MOGs can be used for ambitious 
analysis applications, if they are thermo-cyclically operated. 
A mathematical procedure for data evaluation has to identify 
an unknown gas sample (classification) to avoid misleading 
results like false alarms. Furthermore, it has to determine the 
concentration of the components of the gas sample. Varying 
environmental conditions like varying humidity or varying 
environmental temperature often influence the measurement 
results. These variations must be incorporated in the 
evaluation model of the mathematical procedure.  
The program ProSens developed at KIT was designed to 
meet the above mentioned requirements. ProSens consists of 
two parts: a calibration part and an evaluation part.  
In 
the 
calibration 
part, 
ProSens 
provides 
the 
mathematical calibration model which is the basis for routine 
data evaluation. The determination of the mathematical 
calibration model is based on calibration measurements 
performed by MOG with thermo-cyclic operation. These 
mathematical calibration models are parametric models. 
Their parameters are transferred to the evaluation part for the 
analysis of unknown gas samples.  
In the evaluation part of ProSens, an unknown gas 
sample is analyzed. That means that a substance 
identification 
and 
a 
concentration 
determination 
is 
performed.  
For gas component or compound identification, ProSens 
calculates the so-called theoretical CTP for the calibrated gas 
under consideration and compares this CTP with the 
measured CTP.  
If the measured CTP and the theoretical CTP are close 
together, i.e., a difference value calculated from the sum of 
quadratic differences of every sample point of the measured 
CTP and the theoretical CTP is smaller than a predetermined 
decision value, ProSens identifies the unknown gas sample 
with the related calibrated gas. 
Otherwise ProSens recognizes that the gas sample is not 
the calibrated gas. 
In the case of a successful identification, ProSens 
calculates the concentration of the gas sample. 
In order to demonstrate the performance of the 
mathematical evaluation procedure ProSens, the CTP-data of 
two evaluation experiments of chemical analysis were used, 
first ammonia under various water vapor partial pressures 
and second binary toluene/ethanol-mixtures dissolved in 
water. The experimental details of data acquisition are 
described in [5][6]. 
In the first investigation ammonia was analyzed. To 
perform the mathematical calibration model the CTP was 
measured at different ammonia concentrations (100 ppm, 
200 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm) and at different water vapour 
partial pressures (529, 1322, 2334 Pa) as well. These 12 
calibration points are visualized in Figure 3. This low 
number of calibration points is important, because it keeps 
the calibration costs low. The graphs of measured and 
theoretical CTP are compared when testing an ammonia 
sample (750 ppm) in Figure 4(a) and in case of a non-
ammonia sample (carbon monoxide with 1000 ppm) in 
Figure 4(b). It is evident that ProSens is able to identify the 
ammonia sample. Table I demonstrates that ProSens can 
determine the concentration of ammonia samples quite well, 
even in the case of varying water vapour partial pressures.

In a second example, the CTP-data of binary 
toluene/ethanol mixtures dissolved in water were used for 
chemical analysis. Also in this case only 12 calibration 
points were used in the calibration procedure (Figure 5). 
Three further binary toluene/ethanol-mixtures (analysis test 
points, Figure 5) and a non-toluene/ethanol-mixture were 
analyzed for demonstration of the performance of ProSens. 
The analysis proves that the evaluation procedure is able 
to identify toluene/ethanol binary mixtures and to detect non-
toluene/ethanol-mixtures as well. This is due to the fact that 
in the second case the difference between the theoretical 
CTP and the measured CTP is significantly big (Figure 6) in 
comparison with the negligible difference in the first case 
(Figure 7).

IV. 
PROCAL – A MATHEMATICAL PROCEDURE FOR 
BATCH-WISE CALIBRATION 
For economic reasons, MOGs are typically fabricated in 
batch production. For technological reasons, production 
fluctuations are unavoidable which lead to fluctuations of the 
gas sensors specific features, e.g., manifested in CTP shape 
variations in the case of thermo-cyclic sensor operation. 
Although the signal patterns (e.g., CTPs) of the various 
sensor chips of a production line are similar, each sensor 
chip has to be costly calibrated, in order to yield a high 
analytic performance. The same is true if a sensor chip has to 
be exchanged in case of a defect or if a sensor chip has to be 
recalibrated in case of long-term drifting.  
The basic idea of ProCal is that only one single sensor 
chip (the so-called class reference chip) of the production 
line is measured at all calibration points (typically 5 
calibration points for a single gas analysis application) and 
its signal patterns are sampled. Every other chips of the 
production line are measured at only one calibration point 
(the so-called reference point). 
Next, for every sensor chip a mathematical function (the 
so-called approximation function) is determined which fits 
the signal pattern of the reference point, yield by the 
reference chip, to the signal pattern yield by the 
corresponding sensor chip in a best manner. That means that 
for each sensor chip excluding the reference chip a sensor 
specific approximation function is obtained. 
With these approximation functions, the signal patterns 
of the reference chip are numerically calculated for all the 
other calibration points of the corresponding chips of the 
batch. This means that the signal patterns for the other 
calibration points do not have to be measured but can be 
approximated by numerical calculation. This results in a 
significant reduction of the calibration measurements by 
approximately factor 5. 
The whole procedure is sketched in Table III with sensor 
s1 as the reference chip and concentration con3 as the 
reference point. 
Furthermore, ProCal is able to find the “optimal” 
reference chip and to recognize a priori which sensor chips 
of the production line cannot be calibrated with this 
procedure.  
To demonstrate the effectiveness of ProCal, an 
application was performed with eight thermo-cyclically 
operated gas sensors which were exposed to 0 ppm, 250 
ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm CO in humidified 
synthetic air (50% rH, 21°C), as described in [7].  
In ProCal, only the CTPs of the reference concentration 
point (here at 500 ppm CO) of every sensor (Figure 8) are 
used to calculate sensor specific approximation functions. 
ProCal recognizes that sensor S4 is the best choice for 
the class-reference chip. 
Furthermore, ProCal a priori determines sensor S3 as an 
outlier which cannot be calibrated with this procedure.

To demonstrate how well the numerically measured CTP 
fits the sampled CTP, the data of S2 at 1000 ppm CO are 
visualized in Figure 10. Similar results are obtained at all 
calibration points of the other sensors except the a priori 
excluded sensor S3.

For the determination of the mathematical calibration 
model with ProSens, only the measured CTPs at the 
reference point 500ppm were used. All the other CTPs 
needed for the determination of the calibration model were 
not measured but calculated. Table IV shows the analysis 
results achieved by ProSens. The relative analysis errors in 
all considered cases are less than 11%, except for the a priori 
excluded sensor S3. These errors are comparable with those 
obtained when using sampled data. 
V. 
PROSOURCE - A PROCEDURE FOR SOURCE 
LOCALIZATION  
Based on concentration measurements from spatially 
distributed gas sensors si (gas sensor network), the location 
of a gas source (e.g., from a leakage) is to be determined. To 
solve this problem it is assumed that the emitted substance is 
transported by advection caused by a known homogeneous 
wind field in x-direction and by diffusion.  
The basic idea of the procedure ProSource [8][ 9] is to 
use a two-step approach for the source localization. 
In the first step, for each sensor si, located at xi, the set of 
points Pi is determined, on which the source can lie, taking 
only the specific concentration measurement Ci of sensor si 
into account. 
In the second step, an estimate for the source position x0 
is evaluated by intersecting the sets Pi. 
A. Determining P i  
Each set Pi is given by:  
 
(1)  
 
 
 
 
      (1) 
 
Here, for a fixed but unknown source rate q0 and the 
measured concentration Ci, the set Pi forms an oval in the x-
direction. For different assumed source rates q0 the oval sets 
Pi for one sensor si are plotted in Figure 11.

rates q0 
B. Estimating the source position x0 
Like for one sensor in Figure 11, ovals can be calculated 
for all m sensors of the sensor network. Thus, all m ovals 
intersect at the source position x0, if the source rate, used to 
generate the ovals, equals the true value q0. This is 
demonstrated in Figure 12. In this case, four gas sensors are 
applied.

leakage with the corresponding source rate. In the disturbed 
case, ProSource calculates an estimated source position and a 
corresponding estimated source rate that minimize the 
geometric error of all ovals.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper the mathematical procedures ProSens, 
ProCal and ProSource have been shortly described and their 
performances have been demonstrated with examples using 
real measurement data. 
The examples demonstrate that the procedures developed 
at KIT are powerful tools for economic online and in-situ 
field analyses applications. ProSens is an efficient 
mathematical procedure for evaluation of tin oxide gas 
sensor data, even in the case of variable environmental 
conditions like varying humidity. ProCal is an economic 
mathematical procedure for batch-wise calibration of multi 
gas sensors, useful to reduce the costs and the scope of 
calibration measurements. ProSource is a robust and fast 
procedure for source localization based on spatially 
distributed concentration measurements.  
ProSens is designed to analyze only one gas mixture 
under consideration. But in many applications a multitude of 
different gases may occur, for example in detecting cable fire 
in a cable slot at a very early point of time but with high 
discrimination to other gases. Depending on the various 
coating materials of the cables, a variety of gases or gas 
mixtures can be emitted which have to be simultaneously 
identified and analyzed for early detection of such a 
developing risk. For this reason, ProSens has to be extended 
in a next step to meet these requirements.
