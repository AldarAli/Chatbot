Abstract— The objective of this paper was to identify plant 
species around the water bodies and examine the possible 
impact of alien plants. Sixteen locations were examined 
referring to the vegetation and alien species in particular. The 
locations were the areas surrounding anthropogenic water 
bodies in Krakow and vicinity. Most of them were borrow pits 
left to the process of natural succession. Only one water body 
was of natural origin. In all the locations alien species were 
found. In total, alien species made 20.9% of all species found in 
these locations, which is slightly less than overall percentage in 
Poland (27.4%). There were 30 neophyte species found in total, 
six of them invasive transformers. One species – the bur 
marigold (Bidens frondosa) – was found in nine locations. 
Three species were found in eight locations: the Canada 
golden-rod 
(Solidago 
canadensis,), 
Canadian 
horseweed 
(Conyza canadensis) and annual fleabane (Erigeron annuus). 
Most neophytes (16 species), including the four mentioned 
above were of North American origin. 18 archaeophytes were 
found. Four species had uncertain status. Most alien species 
were covering less than 5% of surveyed vegetation plots. Only 
the cockspur (Echinochloa crus-galli) covered more than 50% 
and the sweet flag (Acorus calamus) covered more than 25% 
(in both cases in one location). In urban areas, alien species are 
common, usually without making much problem (exceptions 
are allergy-causing plants), however; in rural semi-natural 
areas the monitoring is recommended. 
Keywords – vegetation; alien species; water bodies; suburban 
areas. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The paper is based on the authors’ work [1] on plant 
species around the selected water bodies in the Krakow city 
and the surrounding area. Compared to [1] three more 
locations were added, including one natural water body. In 
[1] only artificial water bodies were examined. The present 
paper provides the list of all the plant taxa found in the 
studied locations, including the native ones, which was not 
possible in the previous work. 
Water bodies (natural and artificial) attract many plant 
and animal species, both native and alien. The region of 
Krakow is not very rich is natural lakes, but human-made 
water bodies are abundant there [2]. They have various 
origin, including: borrow pits of various size, made after the 
exploitation of limestone, gravel, sand or clay, fishing ponds, 
former decantation ponds, etc. Natural water bodies in the 
area can be an effect of the karst phenomena or the formation 
of oxbow lakes [3]. Not knowing the history of a specific 
water body it is sometimes difficult to say about its origin, 
because in the process of natural ecological succession and 
sometimes due to human-made reclamation measures, 
human-made ponds get covered with vegetation and become 
inhabited by animal species [4]. Finally, they form semi-
natural environment and can contribute to biodiversity of the 
region. The objective of the study is to examine the 
vegetation of selected water bodies focusing on the presence 
of non-native species and the attempt to assess their possible 
influence on the environment in the area, looking at their 
abundance and frequency of the occurrence. 
Non-native species can be divided into two groups: 
archaeophytes and neophytes. Archaeophytes are plants 
which arrived in the area in pre-historic or early historic 
times and neophytes were introduced in modern times and 
the usual border date is accepted as ca. 1500 – the beginning 
of the era of great geographical discoveries [5]. Most 
archaeophytes in Europe arrived with the agriculture, as 
weeds growing in the fields and nowadays they make an 
integral part of the flora, although can also be invasive. 
Neophytes, however, are usually regarded more dangerous to 
biodiversity. 
Cross-breeds between native and non-native plants are 
regarded non-native and crossbreeds having a neophyte as 
one of the parental species are regarded neophytes [5].  
Apart from the origin, the degree of naturalization in the 
environment is important; Pyšek et al. [5] distinguished 
casual species - alien species that do not form self-sustaining 
populations and naturalized species (synonym: established 
species) that form self-sustaining populations for several life 
cycles. Invasive species make a subset of naturalized species 
forming self-replacing populations, having the potential to 
spread over long distances. Tokarska-Guzik et al. [6], after 
Richardson et al. [7] also differentiated the category of 
transformers (a subset of invasive plants) for the species 
which change the character of ecosystems. 
In Section II and Figure 1, respectively, the list and map 
of locations are given. In the same section a short description 
of every place and methods of studies are provided. In 
Section III and Tables I-III the results are presented. Section 
IV provides the conclusions and recommendations for 
further studies.

STUDY AREA AND METHODS 
The study on the vegetation taken in the areas of the 
water bodies in Krakow and vicinity was carried out in 
summer 2009 (in the case of Bagry and Zakrzówek also 
2008). The studied areas are named below. More detail 
descriptions of the water bodies can be found in [4] [8] [9] 
[10] [11]. The geographic distribution of the sites is 
presented in Figure 1. The given below area of the water 
bodies was calculated by the program Quantum GIS, based 
on the airborne images of the Central Cartographic and 
Surveying Resource. The area included: 
1. 
Two borrow pits situated south-east from the centre 
of Kraków in the area called Płaszów. The area of 
the bigger pond, called Bagry is 30.1 ha and the 
smaller one – called Staw Płaszowski (the Płaszów 
Pond) is 9.0ha. Formed after the exploitation of 
sand and gravel in 1930s [11]. In Table I, they are 
marked as BG and SP, respectively. 
2. 
Staw Dąbski (the Dąbie Pond, marked as D), 2.1 ha 
– situated in Kraków, east from the centre, formed 
in 1930s after the exploitation of clay - by the 
Resolution no. XC/1202/10 of the City Council of 
Krakow the pond was established “Ecologically 
Useful Area” [12]. 
3. 
Zakrzówek (marked ZK) - a borrow pit south-west 
from the centre of Kraków of 17.0 ha surface, made 
in 1990s after quarrying limestone [2].  
4. 
The Pond of the Kaczeńcowa Street (KA) – by the 
Resolution no. XXXI/405/07 of the City Council of 
Krakow established Ecologically Useful Area – the 
area is 0.82 ha [13]. The pond is situated in the 
quarter of Nowa Huta in Krakow. The pond was 
formed as a result of clay exploitation. 
5. 
Former decantation pond of the Steelworks in Nowa 
Huta in the region called Kujawy (marked KU), the 
area of 2.9 ha. 
6. 
Przylasek Rusiecki (PR) – a group of 10-11 gravel 
borrow pits (the number is changeable, because 
some water bodies can temporarily be joint or 
separated), of the total area of 82.19 ha, situated in 
the eastern part of Kraków, quarter Nowa Huta. 
7. 
Borrow pits in Wola Batorska (WB) – the gravel 
quarrying is still going on, so the area has been 
changing. In 2005 it was 13.8 ha.  
8. 
Two borrow pits (exploitation of gravel) of 
Zabierzów 
Bocheński 
(ZB), 
commune 
of 
Niepołomice area of 13.03 ha and 3.43 ha, 
respectively. 
9. 
The oxbow lake (of the Drwinka River) in Ulesie 
(UL) – the only natural water body [4] investigated 
in this paper – 1.0 ha.  
10. The fish pond in Zakrzowiec (ZC) - area 1.94 ha - 
used for commercial angling. 
11. Three ponds in the town of Niepołomice – 
Zamkowa Street (near the castle – 0.1 ha), Mokra 
street (0.1 ha) and Akacjowa street (0.2 ha). Marked 
as ZM, MK, and A, respectively. 
12. The pond on the border between the localities of 
Niepołomice, Podłęże and Staniątki (c.a. 0.6 ha), 
marked as S. 
13. Two borrow pits in the Commune of Liszki called 
Zalew na Piaskach and Budzyń, formerly known as 
‘Kryspinów’ area 24.5 ha and 20.3 ha, respectively. 
Marked as ZP. 
In each location, plots of the area of 10 m2 were 
randomly chosen and the plants growing there were 
identified to the species or – if not possible – to the genus. 
The plants were listed and identified as native, archaeophytes 
or neophytes, invasive or not invasive, harmful or not 
harmful. In the latter case “not harmful” means that harmful 
effects have not been known. However, the expression “not 
harmful” may be a simplification, because it cannot be 
excluded that such effects will be found in the future. To 
identify the species and define their status literature data 
from Poland [6] [14] [15] and other countries of Central 
Europe [5] [16] [17] [18] were used. In most locations the 
Brown-Blanquet method was applied. The plant cover 
abundance was given according to the scale:  
5 - 75-100%,  
4 - 50-75%,  
3 - 25-50%,  
2 - 5-25%,  
1 - <5%, numerous individuals,   
+ - <5%, few individuals,   
r – solitary, with small cover. 
Some more characteristic species were also noted even if 
found outside the plot. In case of smaller ponds, where it was 
difficult to mark the plots, only the list of species was given. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The results are given in Tables I-III. There were 30 
neophyte species found (Table I), which makes 12.0% of all 
the taxa found. 
Eighteen archaeophytes (Table II) 
constituted 7.2% of all the species and four species of 
uncertain status made 1.6% (Table II). In total alien species 
constituted 20.9%, which is slightly less than the percentage 
of alien species in the whole Polish territory, which is 
27.4% - 939 out of 2537 species [15]. According to the 
same study, neophytes (together with casual plants) made 
22% of the total number of species. Archeophytes and 
species of uncertain status constituted 4.5% and 0.05%, 
respectively, which is less than in the areas studied in this 
paper. This fact can be explained by the character of sites 
chosen for this paper, which are rural or semi-rural areas, 
where species connected with agriculture would be 
common. Such species are often archaeophytes. 
 
In the studied area there were six species regarded 
invasive transformers. The most common of them was the 
bur marigold Bidens frondosa found in 9 locations. Three 
species: the Canada golden-rod Solidago canadensis, 
Canadian horseweed Conyza canadensis and annual 
fleabane Erigeron annuus were found in 8 locations. All of 
them are invasive species. The most dangerous are invasive 
transformers, able to change the character, condition, form

or nature of ecosystems over substantial areas relative to the 
extent of that ecosystem [7]. Such species include Bidens 
frondosa and Solidago canadensis. Nevertheless, in the 
study area these species never exceeded 5% of the area.  
Conyza canadensis is regarded invasive weed. Erigeron 
annuus is invasive, but its negative impact on environment 
is not known. 
 
There were 10 casual species found in the study area, 
eight of them occurring only in one place and the Mokra 
street was the most abundant in casual species (4). This was 
a residential area and some ‘exotic’ trees (e.g., Liriodendron 
tulipifera and Catalpa bignonioides) were planted there. 
Three casual species were found near the pond at the 
Zamkowa street, one of them was Phellodendron amurense 
(6 trees planted near the pond), which is rarely grown in 
Poland.  Nevertheless, casual species were also found in less 
human influenced place, such as Zakrzówek. 
 
The sweet flag Acorus calamus is quite common in 
Poland, although in this study it was found only in one 
location - Ulesie – the only natural pond studied here. 
Unlike most alien plants in the study, it was covering a 
relatively large area of the surveyed plot: between 25 and 
50%. 
 
Archaeophytes were represented by 18 species. Four 
species had uncertain status: one can be archaeophyte or 
neophyte, depending on subspecies, which was not 
determined and the origin of three species is still debatable. 
The most widespread archaeophyte species were Melilotus 
albus and Setaria pumila, occurring in 4 locations. 
 
 
The number of alien species in each location ranged 
from 1 in Ulesie to 12 in the Zamkowa Street in 
Niepołomice. Nevertheless, in the Zamkowa and Mokra 
Street (9 alien species) planted trees distort the real picture. 
Considering this, the highest number of non-native species 
would be in Zakrzowiec (9). In that place two locations 
were examined – one near the pond and the other in the 
place of the dry pond. In the dried pond an archaeophyte - 
Echinochloa crus-galli was predominant – the plant cover 
abundance reached 4 in the Braun-Blanquet scale, which 
makes the highest cover by a non-native species in the 
whole study. The detail characteristic of the studied sites 
looks as follows. 
A. Bagry 
The studies in Bagry were carried out on 2/07/2008 by 
Samalzhan Tleubayeva and Aleksandra Wagner in two 
locations: (1) – north-western shore of the water body and 
(2) – northern shore of the water body. Every location 
included coastal plants like Juncus effusus, Phragmites 
australis and Schoenoplectus lacustris. In place (1) there was 
one alien species noticed - Phalaris canariensis, a neophyte 
coming from southern Europe. This was the only alien 
species among 7 species scored in that place. The 2008 
survey in place (2) did not show any alien species, however, 
more detail survey of 3/08/2009 by Dario Hruševar, 
Aleksandra Wagner, Uroš Ljubobratović, and Barbara Patuła 
showed 7 out of 31 alien species, among which 3 (9.7%) 
were archaeophytes: Melilotus albus, Melilotus officinalis 
and Pastinaca sativa. The latter was considered native for a 
long time, but recent studies have shown it was alien [15]. 
Neophytes were represented by two (6.5%) species: Acer 
negundo and Robinia pseudoacacia, both of them classified 
as invasive transformers. The encountered individuals (one 
of each species) were young and belonged to the 
undergrowth. Figure 2 shows the typical vegetation of the 
northern shore of the Bagry borrow pit. 
B. Staw Płaszowski  
 
On the western shore, the studies were carried out on 
2/07/2008 by S. Tleubayeva and A. Wagner. Eleven species 
were found, among them two neophytes, none of them 
invasive: Oenothera biennis L. and one of North American 
ash 
trees, 
probably 
Fraxinus 
pennsylvanica, 
rarely 
encountered in natural environment in Poland. The study of 
20/08/2009 by D. Hruševar and A. Wagner in the eastern 
side of the pond showed 22 species, among which the 
dominant was Phragmites australis. There were four 
(18.2%) neophytes: Solidago gigantea, Solidago canadensis, 
Bidens frondosa, Acer negundo – all of them invasive 
transformers. There was also a feral cultivar - Humulus 
lupulus. Apart from the plot yet another neophyte was found: 
Conyza canadensis, according to [15] the most common 
alien species in Poland.  
C. Staw Dąbski (the Dąbie Pond) 
 
The survey of 07/08/2009 by D. Hruševar, U. 
Ljubobratović and A. Wagner showed 12 species in the plot 
in the eastern part of the pond. Significantly dominant was 
Typha angustifolia. There was only one alien species: 
Bidens frondosa L. In other parts around the pond 32 more 
species were observed, including Nuphar lutea – a native 
species protected by the Polish law – the only place in the 
city of Krakow where it occurs naturally. There were also 
three invasive neophyte plants:  Acer negundo, Solidago 
canadensis and Erigeron annuus. The first two are regarded 
transformer species and the latter is regarded harmless. On 
the southern part of the pond Physocarpus opulifolius was 
grown. This shrub species has become very popular as an 
ornamental plant in the green areas of Krakow over the 
recent 10 years. It originates from North America. 
D. Zakrzówek 
 
Two surveys were carried out in Zakrzówek – on 
18/06/2008 by Samalzhan Tleubayeva, Aleksandra Wagner 
and Robert Mazur – on the hill in the eastern part of the area 
and on 13/08/2009, by D. Hruševar, U. Ljubobratović and 
A. Wagner – in the place slightly further from the previous 
one. In the first place 17 species were observed, including 
one archeophyte Echium vulgare and one neophyte 
Fraxinus pennsylvanica, usually occurring only as a 
cultivated plant. In the second place 23 species were 
present. Among them three alien species were found. One of 
them was Lathyrus tuberosus – an archaeotype, regarded

invasive, but not harmful. Two other species were 
neophytes: Juglans regia – a cultivated tree (originating 
from Caucasus and Central Asia), now expanding into 
natural and semi-natural habitats and Solidago canadensis, 
classified as a transformer. None of them was numerous.  
 
Outside the marked area an archaeophyte Odontites 
verna was observed. This is a weed of Scrophulariaceae 
family. It occurs in the fields and becomes rarer and rarer 
because of the mechanization of agriculture. It was even 
included in the Polish Red Book of Plant Species, 
nevertheless, the exact level of threat is unknown [19]. 
E. The Pond of the Kaczeńcowa Street 
 
Around the water body 26 species were found, four of 
them neophyte invasive transformers - North American: 
Bidens frondosa, Solidago canadensis, Robinia pseudoacia 
and Asian - Impatiens parviflora. The study was carried out 
on 19/08/2009 by D. Hruševar and A. Wagner. 
F. Former decantation pond of Kujawy 
 
The survey carried out on 19/08/2009 by D. Hruševar 
and A. Wagner showed 15 species, where Calamagrostis 
epigejos was dominating. One of them was archaeophyte - 
Melilotus albus and two invasive neophytes: Conyza 
canadensis and Solidago canadensis. Outside the plot one 
more neophyte species - Erigeron annuus was observed as 
well as 8 native species, including Centaurium erythraea, 
protected by the Polish law.  
G. Przylasek Rusiecki 
 
The survey carried out on 25/07/2009 by D. Hruševar, 
U. Ljubobratović and A. Wagner in two places near the only 
pond available for bathing: in eastern part of the shore, near 
the beach and in the northern part – a popular place for 
angling.  
 
In the first place 39 species were found and the ones 
occurring in the biggest quantities were Achilea millefolium 
L. and Melilotus albus. The latter is archaeophyte and both 
are characteristic for pastures. The habitats in Przylasek 
Rusiecki are typically rural despite the fact of being situated 
in the administrative borders of the city of Kraków. Another 
archaeotype was Humulus lupulus. Neophytes were 
represented by 3 species: Erigeron annuus, Bidens frondosa 
and Solidago canadensis. In the second place the most 
common species was Euphorbia virgata. This plant has an 
uncertain status in the Polish flora. There was an 
archaeopophyte species - Melilotus albus.   
 
Apart from the neophyte plants known from the previous 
place, i.e., Erigeron annuus and Solidago canadensis, four 
more species: Medicago sativa, Conyza canadensis, 
Oenothera biennis and a tree species: Populus × 
euramericana were found.  
H. Wola Batorska 
 
The survey was conducted on 19/08/2009 by D. 
Hruševar and A. Wagner, near the ponds in the eastern part 
of the water bodies complex. Place (1) was near the bigger 
pond and place (2) near the smaller pond. In place (1), 36 
species were found, among them 7 of alien origin: 
archaeophytes: Matricaria perforata, Capsella bursa-
pastoris and Lactuca serriola, all of them invasive, but 
usually not harmful. Panicum miliaceum was also found. 
The subspecies was not defined, which in this case, does not 
allow stating if the plant was archaeophyte or neophyte, but 
it is invasive. Other alien species included Phalaris 
canariensis, Acer negundo and Bidens frondosa. In place (2) 
twelve species were found, including one archaeophyte -  
Echinochloa crus-galli and one neophyte - Conyza 
canadensis. In the area outside the plots, one more neophyte 
was found - Picea pungens. The specimen was in a very 
poor shape. Probably it was deliberately planted. 
I. 
Zabierzów Bocheński 
 
On 10/08/2009 D. Hruševar, U. Ljubobratović and A. 
Wagner surveyed two plots in the area: (1) in the central 
part of the complex – near the beach and (2) in the southern 
part of the area. In place (1), 34 species were found, where 
Bolboschoenus maritimus in the part near water and 
Trifolium repens – further from the shore were predominant. 
There was only one neophyte: Bidens frondosa and one of 
uncertain status Cirsium vulgare.  In site (2), there were 39 
species recorded and only one - Solidago canadensis was 
neophyte. There were also Rumex crispus – a plant of an 
uncertain status and Prunus cerasus – a cultivated species, 
in that site occurring as feral. In the water a protected by the 
Polish law species was found - Salvinia natans. Allien 
species included Bidens frondosa and Conyza canadensis. 
J. 
Ulesie  
 
The Ulesie oxbow lake is the only natural pond in the 
area. The survey done on 12/08/2009 by D. Hruševar and A. 
Wagner showed the occurrence of 14 species in the 
examined area and 6 more species outside the area.  
 
Only one species was not native. It was the sweet flag 
Acorus calamus, a species originating from Asia (India and 
China [20] [21]), although also having a subspecies 
occurring in North America. The date of bringing the 
species to Poland (accidentally or deliberately as a 
medicinal plant) is a subject of controversy: several dates 
are given in literature:  16th century (1557 is the probable 
date of the introduction to Europe), 1613, 1652 and 1824. It 
is unclear if the three first dates refer to the cultivated plants 
or plants growing in the wild [15].  
 
Other sources suggest earlier introduction, during the 
Tatar invasions (13th century) [20] [21] (the Polish name of 
the plant is tatarak, which suggests connection with Tatars). 
In that case the plant would be classified as archaeophyte, 
nevertheless, most sources give later dates of introduction. 
The plant is invasive, nevertheless not regarded harmful, on 
the contrary, sometimes used to strengthen embankments 
[20]. In Ulesie it covered 25-50% of the surveyed plot; the 
plants were situated very compactly, which is typical of this 
species [21], but different from non-native plants of other

locations. Other plants included native species, among 
which Glyceria maxima  and sedges Carex spp. covered 
between 5 and 25 per cent of the plot. The species dominant 
in water included Salvinia natans, protected by law. 
Another characteristic species in water was Stratiotes 
aloides.  
 
K. Zakrzowiec 
 
The survey was carried out on 17/08/2009 by D. 
Hruševar and A. Wagner in two sites. Site (1) was close to 
the pond and site (2) was in the place of the pond that was 
dried out several years before the survey. In the site (1) 37 
plant species were found. The dominant species was 
Phragmites australis covering more than 75% of surveyed 
plot. 
 
There were only two neophytes: Erigeron annuus and 
Conyza canadensis and one archaeophyte: Lactuca serriola. 
In place (2) 24 species were found. The dominant one was 
an archaeophyte Echinochloa crus-galli.  
 
Other archaeophytes included Setaria pumila and 
Matricaria perforata Merat. There was also Cirsium 
vulgare, an invasive plant of uncertain status. Neophytes 
included Bidens frondosa, Conyza canadensis and Erigeron 
annnus. 
 
L. Zamkowa Street – Niepołomice 
 
The pond is situated in the centre of the town of 
Niepołomice, near the Niepołomice Castle. The area was 
rich in ruderal species, as well as ornamental plants. 
Altogether, on 5/08/2009 Hruševar and Wagner found 47 
species.  
 
Neophytes included herbaceous plants: Bidens frondosa, 
Conyza 
canadensis, 
Erigeron 
annuus, 
Amaranthus 
retroflexus as well as trees: 6 specimens of Phellodendron 
amurense 
(Figure 
3), 
one 
specimen 
of 
Robinia 
pseudoacacia and shrubs such as Kolwitzia amabilis syn. 
Linnaea 
amabilis 
and 
Philadelphus 
coronarius. 
Archaeophytes included: Digitaria sanguinalis, Setaria 
viridis, Setaria pumila and Malva neglecta. 
 
M. Mokra Street – Niepołomice 
 
The survey was carried out by D. Hruševar and A. 
Wagner on 17/08/2009. There were 31 plants found in the 
plot near the pond. Archaeophytes included: Pastinaca 
sativa and Setaria pumila. Neophytes were: Erigeron 
annuus, Conyza canadensis and Veronica persica.  
 
The presence of privet Ligustrum vulgare could be of 
anthropogenic or natural origin, but anthropogenic origin 
was more likely, nevertheless, it was not counted as alien 
species.  
 
The water body was in the residential area and many 
non-native 
species 
were 
planted: 
Picea 
pungens, 
Liriodendron tulipifera, Catalpa bignonioides, Pinus nigra, 
Abies concolor and Thuja occidentalis. 
N. The Akacjowa Street – Niepołomice 
 
Around the water body 40 plant species were recorded 
on 17/08/2009 by D. Hruševar and A. Wagner. There were 
two archaeophytes: Lactuca serriola, Echinochloa crus-
galli and three neophytes in the area: Bidens frondosa, 
Robinia 
pseudoacacia 
and 
horseradish 
Armoracia 
rusticana. The latter is a cultivated plant, invasive, but not

Near the pond situated in Staniątki on the border with 
the village of Podłęże and Staniątki on 11/08/2009 D. 
Hruševar and A. Wagner recorded 11 plant species. The 
dominant species was native reed mace (cattail) Typha 
latifolia covering more than 50% of the area (degree four in 
the Braun-Blanquet scale). Alien species included Bidens 
frondosa and Conyza canadensis. Six more species were 
observed out of the plot, including one neophyte – the 
horseradish Armoracia rusticana and one archaeophyte -  
Setaria glauca. 
 
P. Zalew na Piaskach 
 
The place selected for the survey on 31/07/2009 (by D. 
Hruševar U. Ljubobratović and A. Wagner) was in the area 
where the pond was shallower and overgrown by 
macrophytes such as Typha latifolia L. There were 40 
vascular species and a moss Sphagnum spp. There was one 
neophyte there: Erigeron annuus. 
 
 
The study showed the presence of alien plants, including 
neophytes in each location. Many of them are invasive, 
although only in few survey plots they were dominant or 
even made a significant proportion in the land cover. The 
most commonly found species (in terms of the number of 
locations) - Solidago canadensis - never covered more than 
25% and often less than 5% of the survey plot. This seems 
to be compliant with an interesting study done by 
Orczewska [22] suggesting that some native species (such 
as Urtica dioica and Galium aparine) can be more 
dangerous for the habitat than neophytes (such as Solidago 
gigantea). The study also confirms the data suggesting 
higher presence of non-native plants in human-influenced 
areas [4], [15]. The lowest number, which was scored in 
Zabierzów Bocheński and Zalew na Piaskach, places 
relatively distant from residential areas. The eastern part of 
the study area (Zabierzów Bocheński) is situated near the 
Niepołomice Forest, a place with some amount of strictly 
protected areas, where invasive plants pose serious danger 
for biodiversity. Fortunately, in that area the influence of 
invasive species is relatively small (Solidago canadensis 
and S. gigantea), nevertheless cannot be neglected. The 
origin of neophytes is given in Table I. The majority - 18 
out of 30 species originated from North America, 5 species 
come from Southern Europe, 2 from the Caucasus Mts. and 
5 from Asia (Central and East).

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In total, 52 alien taxa were recorded for 16 locations near 
the water bodies in the Krakow region, which made 20.9 per 
cent of all the species found in the studied area. From that 
number, 30 taxa are neophytes, and 18 are archaeophytes, 
the status of four was uncertain. The percentage of alien 
species was lower than the one found for the whole Polish 
territory [15], while the percentage of archeophytes was 
higher. Although alien species occurred in every location in 
the study area, only two species: the sweet flag Acorus 
calamus and cockspur Echinochloa crus-galli reached 3rd  
and 4th degree of cover, respectively, in the Braun-Blanquet 
scale. Other species, on surveyed vegetation plots, usually 
could only be marked by “+”. 
Among the alien species a particular attention should be 
paid on invasive transformer species: the ash-leaved maple 
(Acer negundo), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), 
Canadian golden rod (Solidago canadensis), giant goldenrod 
(Solidago gigantea), bur marigold (Bidens frondosa) and 
small-flowered touch-me-not (Impatiens parviflora).  
In the residential areas many alien tree species are grown. 
Apart from two species (the ash-leaved maple and black 
locust) they are not invasive and most of them can be only 
sporadically found in the wild. 
 Further monitoring of invasive plant species is 
necessary, also because of the perspective of climatic 
changes. Warming the climate will provide better conditions 
for the reproduction of southern species so that they could 
become invasive. The example can be the common walnut 
(Juglans regia), which was found in one location, but, 
according to literature [11] this species is in the initial phase 
of invasion, so it is likely to extend its range.
