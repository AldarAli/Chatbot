Abstract—In this paper, by exploiting the frequency domain, 
we propose a Countrywide Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) 
Spectrum Allocation and Reuse (CoMSAR) technique that 
allocates and reuses spatially the countrywide 28 GHz spectrum to 
each Mobile Network Operator (MNO) of a country to operate its 
small cells per floor in a building. An interference management 
scheme is developed to avoid Co-Channel Interference (CCI) in 
each apartment. We model user statistics per small cell and 
interferer statistics per apartment and formulate the optimal 
amount of spectrum for each MNO. We derive average capacity, 
Spectral Efficiency (SE), Energy Efficiency (EE), and Cost 
Efficiency (CE) for the proposed technique and the traditional 
Static Licensed Spectrum Allocation (SLSA) technique allocating 
an equal amount of spectrum to each MNO. By varying CCI and 
spectrum reuse, extensive numerical and simulation results and 
analyses are carried out for a country consisting of four MNOs, 
i.e., MNOs 1, 2, 3, and 4 with a subscriber base of, respectively, 
40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the countrywide subscribers. It is 
shown that CoMSAR with no CCI provides 2.5 times higher 
average capacity, SE, EE, and CE than that with the maximum 
CCI.  However, with regard to SLSA, it improves the average 
capacity, SE, EE, and CE of MNO 1 by 300%, 165%, 75%, and 
60%, respectively, with no CCI, each of which decreases to the 
minimum value when CCI is the maximum. Further, we show that 
CoMSAR can satisfy SE and EE requirements for sixth-
generation (6G) mobile systems by reusing the countrywide 28 
GHz spectrum to small cells of MNO 1 of about 61.2% less number 
of single-floor buildings with no CCI, whereas 6.4% less number 
of single-floor buildings with the maximum CCI, than that 
required by SLSA. Finally, we discuss the benefits and point out 
key issues of CoMSAR for further studies.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Background        
The high capacity and data rate requirements for the 
existing mobile networks impose a demand for the massive 
radio spectrum availability on a Mobile Network Operator 
(MNO). Due to this reason, the traditional model (Foster [2] for 
allocating a portion of the licensed spectrum statically in an 
exclusive manner for a long time has no longer been considered 
effective to address the ever-increasing high capacity and data 
rate demands. Though these requirements have been increased 
over time, the availability of the spectrum for an MNO has not 
increased correspondingly, resulting in the scarcity of the radio 
spectrum. In this regard, spectrum allocation and spectrum 
exploitation can play a vital role in addressing the spectrum 
scarcity for an MNO in a country. Spectrum allocation 
techniques describe how the spectrum specified for a country is 
allocated to its MNOs. The usefulness of a spectrum allocation 
technique is affected by factors, such as the amount and 
duration of the allocated spectrum to an MNO, as well as the 
user traffic demand of an MNO (Saha [3]). By carefully 
allocating the spectrum specified for a country among its 
MNOs, the available amount of spectrum for an MNO can be 
extended considerably. Furthermore, by exploiting the 
available spectrum for an MNO in space, for example, the 
utilization of the spectrum can be increased. Accordingly, the 
spatial reuse of the spectrum to small cells, particularly in a 3-
Dimensional (3D) space, e.g., a multistory building, is 
considered an effective approach to increase the utilization of 
the available spectrum.  
B. Related Work  
      Numerous research works have already addressed the issues 
of spectrum allocation, as well as spectrum exploitation. For 
example, Yan et al. [4] have proposed methods for the dynamic 
spectrum allocation in cognitive radio systems, and Wei et al. 
[5] have presented a system-level dynamic frequency spectrum 
allocation scheme based on central heterogeneous network 
architecture. Using the carrier aggregation technique, Shajaiah 
et al. [6] have considered the optimization of resource 
allocation, whereas, based on the access mechanism, Liu et al.  
[7] have proposed a joint subcarrier and power allocation 
method. Further, Kim et al. [8] have introduced the 
functionalities required for entities related to the spectrum 
allocation to propose a spectrum allocation algorithm in 
multiple network operators’ scenarios. Moreover, Kim et al. [9] 
have introduced and formulated the problem of the optimum 
spectrum allocation in cognitive radios.  Furthermore, Gu [10] 
has proposed a new dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm to 
resolve channel conflict problems in channel switching and 
Bhuiyan et al. [11] have developed a traffic-load-aware channel 
allocation mechanism for secondary users.  
      Regarding the spectrum exploitation by means of reusing 
the available spectrum, an analytical model has been proposed 
by Saha and Aswakul [12] to reuse the microwave spectrum, as 
well as by Saha [13] to reuse the 28 GHz millimeter-wave 
(mmWave) spectrum, in a 3D building of small cells. Likewise, 
Saquib et al. [14] have investigated a number of Fractional 
Frequency Reuse (FFR) schemes, whereas Hasan et al. [15] 
have proposed the dynamic fractional frequency reuse (DFFR) 
method to reduce the inter-cell interference. Moreover, Saha 
[16] has proposed a technique to reuse the same spectrum for 
small cells deployed in a building by forming 3D clusters of 
small cells. Besides, in time-varying channels, Yen et al. [17] 
have developed new FFR patterns for multi-cell orthogonal

frequency-division multiple access systems with frequency or 
time division duplexing (FDD/TDD).  Further, Lam et al. [18] 
have presented the performance of well-known frequency reuse 
algorithms in terms of, e.g., system throughput and average 
packet loss ratio.   
C. Problem Statement and Contribution  
      However, unlike the traditional static licensed spectrum 
allocation that considers allocating a certain portion of the 
countrywide spectrum to an MNO, the whole countrywide 
mmWave spectrum can be allocated to each MNO to increase 
its spectrum. Besides, due to the high floor penetration loss, the 
same countrywide mmWave spectrum for each MNO can be 
exploited spatially on the inter-floor level to reuse more than 
once by small cells within a building. Hence, a technique that 
can employ both the spectrum allocation and spectrum 
exploitation means to the mmWave spectrum using in-building 
small cells to allocate the countrywide mmWave spectrum to 
each MNO, which is exploited further to be spatially reused by 
small cells in a building is considered promising to achieve high 
Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) 
requirements for the next generation mobile networks.  
      Numerous studies have already attempted to achieve the 
expected SE and EE requirements for the Sixth-Generation 
(6G) mobile networks by employing the mmWave spectrum 
allocation and exploitation. For example, by exploiting the 
power domain, Saha [19] has proposed a hybrid interweave-
underlay spectrum access and reuse technique to address the 
dynamic spectrum access and reuse of the countrywide 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum to in-building small cells of each MNO in 
a country to achieve the required SE and EE of 6G. Unlike the 
countrywide mmWave spectrum, by exploiting the secondary 
spectrum trading, Saha [20] has proposed a dynamic exclusive-
use spectrum access method to share partly and exclusively the 
licensed mmWave spectrum of one MNO to another in a 
country to address the SE and EE requirements for 6G. Further, 
Saha [21] has presented a technique for the 3D spatial reuse of 
28 and 60 GHz mmWave spectra allocated to an MNO to its in-
building small cells to achieve the expected SE and EE 
requirements for 6G networks. Unlike these existing literature 
works, in this paper, by exploiting the frequency domain, we 
propose A Countrywide MmWave Spectrum Allocation and 
Reuse (CoMSAR) technique that considers allocating and then 
reusing the massive 28 GHz mmWave spectrum specified 
countrywide to each MNO of a country to operate its small cells 
deployed on each floor in a multistory building to achieve the 
expected SE and EE requirements for 6G mobile networks.  
D. Organization  
In addressing the proposed technique, we first present the 
system architecture and the proposed technique, as well as 
develop a frequency-domain Co-Channel Interference (CCI) 
avoidance scheme, in Section II. In Section III, we model user 
statistics per small cell and interferer statistics per apartment. 
We also formulate an expression of the optimal amount of 
spectrum per MNO for an arbitrary number of MNOs in a 
country. In Section IV, we derive average capacity, SE, EE, and 
Cost Efficiency (CE) metrics for the proposed, as well as the 
traditional Static Licensed Spectrum Allocation (SLSA), 
techniques. In addition, we show mathematically the 
outperformance of the proposed technique over the SLSA 
technique. In Section V, extensive numerical and simulation 
results and analyses for an example scenario of a country 
consisting of four MNOs are carried out by varying the effect 
of the spectrum reuse and the co-channel interference of 
interferer user equipments (UEs) within each apartment. 
Moreover, we also show that the proposed technique with two 
extreme CCI scenarios, including no CCI and the maximum 
CCI, for an MNO can achieve the SE and EE requirements for 
6G mobile systems. Section VI covers the discussion on the 
offered benefits of the proposed technique, as well as its further 
research directions. We conclude the paper in Section VII. In 
Appendix A, a list of acronyms/abbreviations is shown in Table 
A1, and a list of selected notations is given in Table A2.  
E. Declaration  
This paper is an extended version of the work Saha [1] 
presented at The Fifteenth International Conference on Systems 
and Networks Communications (ICSNC), Porto, Portugal, 
2020. The conference article Saha [1] has been extended in two 
major directions as follows.  
• 
With introducing the 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum, and  
• 
Without introducing the 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum,  
in addition to the 28 GHz licensed spectrum to each small cell 
such as in [1].  
Particularly, we have reported the extended journal version 
of [1] concerning the allocation and reuse of both the 28 GHz 
licensed spectrum and 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum in [22], 
whereas the allocation and reuse of only the 28 GHz licensed 
spectrum in this paper.  
The conference article Saha [1] is used as the basis of both 
journal versions (i.e., [22] and this paper), which differ mainly 
from Saha [1] in terms of enhancement of background material, 
expansion of discussion, and inclusion of new problems and 
results. More specifically, in both journal versions, as compared 
to Saha [1],  
• 
We model user statistics per small cell and interferer 
statistics per apartment in a building.  
• 
We show mathematically the outperformance of the 
proposed technique over the traditional SLSA technique.  
• 
We also clarify the simulation parameters and assumptions 
used for generating the performance results.  
• 
A more detailed performance evaluation and analysis than 
that in Saha [1] are carried out by varying the effect of the 
spectrum reuse (both vertically within a building and 
horizontally in between buildings) and the co-channel 
interference (by considering all possible number of 
interferer UEs within each apartment).  
• 
Finally, in addition to the offered benefits of the proposed 
technique, we discuss its future research directions.  
Note that due to an extended version of Saha [1] and being 
[22] published earlier than this paper, some materials in this 
paper, in terms of, e.g., text, equations, figures, tables, notations, 
and abbreviations, may be found merged with that in [22] by

citing [22]. Finally, this paper is written such that the readers 
will find it self-contained, detailed, and insightful in contrast to 
its conference version Saha [1]. 
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, PROPOSED TECHNIQUE AND 
INTERFERENCE MANAGEMENT 
A. System Architecture 
Figure 1 shows the system architecture consisting of four 
MNOs, defined as MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, and MNO 4, 
operating in a country. We assume that all MNOs have similar 
system architectural features including three types of Base 
Stations (BSs), namely macrocell BSs (MBSs), Picocell BSs 
(PBSs), and Small Cell BSs (SBSs). Hence, for simplicity in 
evaluating the performances, the detailed architecture of only 
one MNO, i.e., MNO 1, is shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). SBSs 
are deployed only within 3-dimensional multistory buildings 
(Figure 1(b)). Both SBSs and PBSs are located within the 
coverage of an MBS. All macrocell UEs per MBS are served 
either by the MBS itself or any PBSs. Due to the favorable 
characteristics, MBSs and PBSs operate at a low-frequency 
band, i.e., 2 GHz, whereas all in-building SBSs operate at the 
28 GHz mmWave band (Figure 1(a)). 
We consider that each MNO is given access to the 
countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum to extend its spectrum 
at all times by enforcing the frequency-domain CCI 
management scheme, as shown in Figure 1(c). Given that CCI 
for an MNO o increases with an increase in the number of UEs 
of other MNOs O\o (Figure 1(c) for MNO 1), Figure 1(c) shows 
all possible CCI scenarios for a small cell in an apartment of 
MNO 1 on a floor based on the presence of UEs of other MNOs 
O\o within the same apartment of a building. For simplicity, 
CCI scenarios are shown for a single small cell each serving 
one UE at a time in an apartment on a floor. Besides, the 
penetration loss of a typical reinforced concrete floor in the 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum is about 55 dB for the first floor 
[23][24][25]. Hence, by exploiting the high floor penetration 
loss of the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum, on top of the spectrum 
extension by allocating the countrywide massive 28 GHz 
spectrum to each MNO, we consider the spectrum exploitation 
by reusing the same countrywide spectrum to SBSs of each 
MNO on each floor of a building to increase spectral utilization 
(Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). We propose a technique for the 
spectrum allocation and the spectrum exploitation of the 
countrywide 28 GHz spectrum to each MNO in what follows.  
B. Proposed Technique   
We propose a countrywide mmWave spectrum allocation 
and reuse (CoMSAR) technique to extend the available 
spectrum for an MNO and to increase its utilization as follows.  
Each MNO of a country is assigned with the massive 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum specified countrywide, which is 
reused further, to operate its small cells deployed on each floor 
in a building at the cost of paying the spectrum licensing fee 
subject to avoiding CCI. The amount of the spectrum licensing 
fee for an MNO is updated corresponding to the change in its 
number of subscribers at each license renewal term 
trnw
.  
      In this regard, for the 28 GHz mmWave spectrum 
allocation, each MNO is allocated to the countrywide 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum by the National Regulatory Agency (NRA) 
or any third party for a term 
trnw
. For the 28 GHz mmWave 
spectrum reuse, each MNO can exploit the high floor 
penetration loss of a multistory building at mmWave such that 
the allocated countrywide full 28 GHz mmWave spectrum can 
be reused to its SBSs deployed on each floor due to the 
insignificant or no CCI generated between adjacent floors 
(Figure 1(b)). This results in reusing the allocated countrywide 
spectrum to an MNO more than once to its SBSs within a 
multistory building and, hence, improving the countrywide 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum utilization.   
      Each MNO pays the licensing fee to the NRA, which is 
defined by the administration based on the ratio of its actual 
number of subscribers to the sum of the total number of 
subscribers of all MNOs countrywide at
trnw
. Hence, the 
proposed technique can help overcome the lack of a sufficient 
amount of spectrum of an MNO to serve the necessary demand 
of its users, as well as address the issue of the under-utilized or 
unused spectrum of other MNOs, which in turn improve the 
overall countrywide spectrum utilization. Also, an MNO pays 
the licensing fee only for the amount of spectrum that it uses at 
any term 
trnw
(i.e., in accordance with its number of users). 
C. Co-channel Interference Management  
Since all MNOs consider operating in-building small cells 
at the same countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum, CCI 
occurs when small cell UEs of more than one MNO on the same 
floor in a building are scheduled to the same frequency 
simultaneously. Such CCI can be avoided by allocating UEs 
orthogonally in the frequency domain [26]. More specifically, 
UEs of MNOs located on the same floor in a building are 
allocated orthogonally to different parts of the countrywide 28 
GHz mmWave spectrum, as shown in Figure 2. Hence, UEs of 
not more than one MNO can be allocated to the same frequency 
in any Transmission Time Interval (TTI). The existence of an 
interfering UE can be detected either by the small cell or the 
small cell UE itself using any conventional spectrum sensing 
techniques. 
III. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
A.  Modeling User Statistics per Small Cell  
Like [22], we first model user statistics per small cell in this 
section. We are interested in finding the number of users per 
small cell of an MNO o in an apartment for an observation time 
Q. Let

denote the number of UEs 
served by an SBS s of an MNO o at any time t. According to 
[27][28], sessions or call arrivals can be modeled as a Poisson 
process. Hence, the traffic activity of a small cell UE served by 
an in-building SBS can be modeled as an exponentially 
distributed continuous-time Poisson process. Since given the 
present state, the future state is independent of the past state, the 
traffic activity of a UE can be modeled as a two-state Markov 
chain where the off-state traffic activity to on-state traffic 
activity transition rate of a UE is denoted by λ  and the on-state

    Note that, since the rate of arrival of UEs to any in-building 
SBS s is relatively low due to the small coverage, the value of 
s
U  is small in the Poisson distribution of small cell UEs [22]. 
In other words, smaller values of 
s
U  are more probable than 
the larger ones such that the distribution of small cell UEs of an 
SBS lies mostly toward the left of the curve.

follows.  
      The amount of spectrum allocated to UEs of an MNO o on 
any floor
fl

with the ratio of the number of subscribers

MNOs O corresponding to the same floor 
fl
  in the building l 
in any TTI t at term

.  
      Note that the radio spectrum is not free of cost. Hence, 
licensing more spectrum causes an increase in the cost of an 
MNO. Moreover, as the total amount of the spectrum specified 
for a country is fixed, licensing more spectrum by one MNO 
causes the scarcity of the required spectrum by another MNO 
in a country, resulting in degrading the quality-of-service (QoS). 
This problem can be addressed if each MNO takes the license 
of the amount of the spectrum as low as possible corresponding 
to its actual number of subscribers so that the issue of the under-
utilized or unused spectrum by one MNO, as well as the lack of 
a sufficient amount of spectrum for another MNO, to serve its 
necessary user demand can be addressed.  
      Since each MNO favors minimizing the cost of licensing 
spectrum while ensuring to serve its user demands adequately 
to retain QoS, we consider a minimization problem for 
allocating the countrywide mmWave spectrum to each MNO to 
increase the overall countrywide mmWave spectrum utilization. 
Hence, the optimal amount of licensed spectrum

Following [22], recall that we assume

for each 
SBS of each MNO o within each apartment of any building. 
Since the arrival of a UE to any SBS in an apartment can be 
modeled as a Poisson process, under the above assumption, the 
presence of the number of interferer UEs in each apartment can 
be expressed following the same procedure presented for 
modeling the user statistics per small cell in Section III(A). In 
doing so, let  


,max

probability of

IV. PERFORMANCE METRICS ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS  
A. Performance Metrics  
Let SM,o denote the number of macrocells, and SP,o denotes 
the number of picocells per macrocell of an MNO o.  Also, let 
T denote the simulation run time with the maximum time of Q 
(in time steps each lasting 1 ms) such that T= {1, 2, 3,…,Q}. 
Let
PMC
,
PC
P
, and 
SC
P
denote, respectively, the transmission 
power of a macrocell, a picocell, and a small cell of an MNO o. 
Using Shannon’s capacity formula, a link throughput at RB=i 
in TTI=t for an MNO o at 
trnw
in bps per Hz is given by [31][32]

      On the other hand, when employing the traditional SLSA 
technique, each MNO o is allocated to an equal amount of 
spectrum of (

. However, the number of 
subscribers of MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, and MNO 4 are not 
the same such that each MNO does not need the same amount 
of spectrum. More specifically, since the amount of spectrum 
required to serve the user demand of any MNO varies in 
accordance with its number of subscribers, MNO 1, MNO 2, 
MNO 3, and MNO 4 can use, respectively, 10%, 20%, 25%, 
and 25% of

. Hence, the total amount of the spectrum

denote, respectively, the achievable capacities corresponding to 
the spectra in (30) and (31) due to employing the proposed 
CoMSAR and SLSA techniques. 
      Since SE is directly proportional, whereas EE and CE are 
inversely proportional, to the achievable capacity, using (17) 
and (21) for the SE, (18) and (22) for the EE, and (24) and (25) 
for the CE, it can be shown that the proposed CoMSAR 
technique provides better SE, EE, and CE performances than 
the traditional SLSA technique [22].  
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
A. Default Parameter and Assumption 
Table I shows the default simulation parameters and 
assumptions used for evaluating the performance of the 
proposed technique for all MNOs O countrywide. The 
performance metrics are derived analytically for an arbitrary 
number of MNOs in a country and the evaluation is carried out 
for four MNOs (i.e., O=4) as an example scenario. The arrival 
of mobile traffic to a small cell is captured using the Poisson 
process to model the presence of UEs of MNOs within each 
apartment. Simulation assumptions and parameters used for the 
performance evaluation are in line with the recommendations 
from the standardization bodies such as the 3rd generation 
partnership 
project 
(3GPP) 
and 
International 
Telecommunication Union-Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-
R).   
For simplicity in analysis and finding a closed-form 
expression, we assume that each small cell of an MNO o can 
serve one UE at a time, i.e.,
,
1
E Us o
=




. Moreover, because of 
the favorable signal propagation characteristics in indoor 
environments and the availability of large spectrum bandwidth, 
we consider the 28 GHz millimeter-wave spectrum bands to 
serve high data rates within a short distance. However, all the 
macrocells and picocells are considered to operate at the 2 GHz 
band to provide large coverage and less number of hand-offs. 
Because high-frequency signals exhibit a low multi-path fading 
effect indoors, the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) large-scale signal 
propagation model is assumed for 28 GHz. Further, due to 
serving a UE at a short distance over a LOS channel by an SBS, 
similar signal propagation characteristics are considered within 
the same building, as well as between adjacent buildings.  
Because of a high external wall penetration loss, low 
transmission power, and the existence of distance-dependent 
path loss for the distance in-between adjacent buildings for 
high-frequency signals, we assume an insignificant CCI effect 
from SBSs of one building to that of adjacent buildings 
resulting in reusing the same spectrum to SBSs within each 
building. Furthermore, we adopt the full buffer traffic model to 
consider serving user traffic at all times and the proportional 
fair scheduler to provide a balanced trade-off between the 
fairness and throughput performances. The performance results 
are generated by a simulator built using the computational tool 
MATLAB R2012b taking into account all parameters and 
assumptions stated above and given in Table I. Finally, the 
algorithm used to generate the performance results is given in 
Algorithm 1.  
B. Performance Result and Analysis       
      The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated 
with regard to the traditional SLSA technique. We assume that 
MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, and MNO 4 have the number of 
subscribers of 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, of the 
8

 (Table I).  
1) Impact of the CCI  
The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated for 
UEs of MNO 1 by varying the number of co-channel interferer 
UEs of ICCI=0 to ICCI=3 of MNOs O\o=1 per apartment on a 
single floor of a building for a country with O=4 MNOs. Figure 
4 shows the performance improvement of the proposed 
technique in terms of the average capacity, SE, EE, and CE with 
respect to that of the traditional SLSA technique. Note that we 
consider the worst-case scenario, i.e., 
rnw,
,
1,
fl
t
l
t
M

 is minimum in 
(6),  such that ICCI=1 corresponds to a UE of MNO=2 with 30% 
of subscribers, and  ICCI=2 corresponds to UEs of MNO=2 and 
MNO=3 with 20% of subscribers. Whereas, ICCI=0 and ICCI=3 
correspond to two extreme scenarios, including when no CCI 
occurs due to the absence of UEs of all other MNOs O\o=1, and 
when the maximum CCI occurs due to the presence of UEs of 
each MNO of O\o=1 on a floor in a building.  
      With no co-channel interferer UEs in any apartment (i.e., 
ICCI=0), the maximum amount of full countrywide mmWave 
spectrum can be allocated to SBSs of MNO 1 on each floor in 
all TTIs. As ICCI increases, the amount of allocated spectrum to 
MNO 1 decreases, and for the maximum co-channel interferer 
UEs, ICCI=3, only 40% of the countrywide spectrum can be 
allocated to SBSs of MNO 1 on each floor. Hence, the spectrum 
allocated to SBSs of MNO 1 on each floor with ICCI=0 is 2.5 
times (
)
1 0.4 of the allocated spectrum ICCI=3.  
      Since the achievable capacity depends directly on the 
amount of spectrum, the maximum and minimum average 
capacity, SE, EE, and CE for MNO 1 can be achieved, 
respectively, with ICCI=0 and ICCI=3 as shown in Figure 4. 
Moreover, Figure 4 also shows that the proposed technique with 
no CCI provides 2.5 times higher average capacity, SE, EE, and 
CE performances than that with the maximum CCI.  
Furthermore, with regard to the traditional SLSA, the proposed 
technique improves the average capacity, SE, EE, and CE of 
MNO 1 by 300%, 165%, 75%, and 60%, respectively with no 
co-channel interferer UEs, ICCI=0. The improvement factors, 
however, decrease as ICCI increases and get to a minimum when 
ICCI=3. Hence, CCI plays a vital role in the overall performance 
of an MNO when allocated to the countrywide spectrum.  
2) Effect of the Spectrum Reuse 
      Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the effect of reusing the same 
countrywide spectrum both vertically to each floor of SBSs of 
MNO 1 in a multistory building and horizontally to each 
building over a macrocell coverage.  As can be seen from 
Figure 5, the proposed technique provides better SE and EE 
performances than the traditional SLSA technique, with the 
variation of either 
FL
, or L, or both. Moreover, with an 
increase in the number of floors 
FL
, i.e., vertical reuse factor 
(RF), as well as the number of buildings L, i.e., horizontal RF, 
SE increases linearly, whereas EE increases negative 
exponentially, irrespective of the degree of CCI. Note, 
however, that since SE is affected additionally by the optimal 
amount of countrywide spectrum, the proposed technique with 
the maximum CCI provides insignificant SE while noticeable 
EE improvement over the traditional SLSA technique because 
of its higher average capacity performance, as shown in Figures 
5(a) and 5(b).  
      Hence, the performance of the proposed technique is greatly 
influenced by the CCI, and a significant performance gain can 
be achieved when the aggregate CCI is limited to a low value. 
However, due to a small coverage of an indoor small cell and a 
low probability of co-existing all interferer UEs of MNOs 
O\o=1 within an apartment, the proposed technique can 
improve considerably the average SE and EE performances. 
Moreover, the impact of CCI can be compensated by increasing 
the RF. For example, the proposed technique with the 
maximum CCI for vertical RF=6 or more can provide better SE 
and EE performances than when operating under no CCI 
scenarios for vertical RF=1 for any horizontal RF.  
C. Performance Comparison   
     According to [39][40], the future 6G mobile systems are 
expected to require 10 times average SE (i.e., 270-370 bps/Hz), 
as well as 10 times average EE (i.e., 0.3×10-6 Joules/bit), of that 
of 5G mobile systems [41][42]. Using Figure 5, Table II shows 
the variation in the required values of the vertical RF 
FL
and 
horizontal RF L when employing the traditional SLSA 
technique and the proposed technique with no CCI, as well as 
the maximum CCI, scenarios for each apartment on each floor 
of any building for MNO 1 to satisfy both the SE and EE 
requirements for 6G mobile systems.  
      From Table II, it can be found that the required SE and EE 
for 6G can be achieved by changing either vertical RF 
FL
 or 
horizontal RF L such that their product, i.e., (
FL
×L), defines 
the achievable SE and EE performances. Moreover, the 
proposed CoMSAR technique can satisfy both the SE of 370 
bps/Hz and EE of 0.3 µJ/bit for 6G mobile systems by reusing 
(horizontally) the countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum to 
small cells of MNO 1 of about 61.2% less number of single-
floor (i.e.,
FL
 =1) buildings (i.e., L=12) with no CCI, whereas 
6.4% less number of single-floor buildings (i.e., L=29) with the 
maximum CCI, than that required by the traditional SLSA 
technique (i.e., L =31).  
VI. OFFERED BENEFITS AND FURTHER OUTLOOKS 
A. Offered Benefits  
The proposed technique benefits from a number of issues as 
follows. Unlike the traditional SLSA technique, the proposed 
technique ensures the availability of a large amount of spectrum 
by allocating the countrywide full (instead of a portion) 
mmWave spectrum to each MNO. Further, it provides an 
efficient spectrum utilization by allowing each MNO dynamic 
and flexible (instead of static and dedicated) access to the 
countrywide spectrum [22]. Furthermore, it allows an MNO to 
pay only for the amount of spectrum that it uses to serve its user 
demands (i.e., in proportionate with the number of its users) at 
any term trnw, resulting in reducing the cost per unit capacity 
(i.e., bps).

B. Further Outlooks 
1) Implementation perspectives:    The implementation of 
the proposed technique warrants the following issues [22], 
including updating the dynamic usage of the countrywide 
spectrum on each floor by UEs of different MNOs and 
enforcing CCI management. In this regard, SBSs of each MNO 
per floor can keep sensing using either a reactive or proactive 
approach to detect the status of the shared full countrywide 
spectrum usage and coordinate with SBSs of other MNOs on 
the same floor to update the CCI status and amount of the 
shared spectrum usage for each MNO. However, such 
coordination among SBSs of different MNOs generates a huge 
amount of control signaling overheads depending on the size of 
the group of the coordinated SBSs. The larger the size of the 
group of the coordinated SBSs, the greater the amount of 
generated control signaling overheads, as well as the delay in 
updating the CCI status.  
In general, coordination among SBSs can be done centrally 
or in a distributed manner [22]. Central coordination of SBSs 
per building, for example, can contribute to achieving a global 
optimization in updating the CCI status and the corresponding 
spectrum allocation to each MNO. This, however, comes at the 
cost of generating high control signaling overheads. On the 
other hand, by limiting the size of a coordinated group of SBSs, 
control signaling overheads due to the coordination can be kept 
limited. This, however, comes at the cost of allowing a local 
optimization in updating the CCI status and the corresponding 
allocated spectrum to each MNO. Hence, a tradeoff between the 
optimal performance in the CCI and scheduled spectrum status 
updates per MNO and the generated control signaling overhead 
due to the coordination needs to be achieved, which asks for

further studies [22]. We consider this issue as part of our future 
research studies. 
2) Modeling 3D spectrum reuse:   In this paper, we limit 
reusing the same countrywide full spectrum in small cells of an 
MNO o on each floor (i.e., 2-dimensional space) of a multistory 
building like [22]. However, the countrywide full spectrum 
allocated to an MNO o in the primary level can be exploited in 
the 3D space of a multistory building of small cells to increase 
the vertical RF even further for a building. More specifically, 
by enforcing a maximum CCI, a minimum distance between 
co-channel small cells (each located in an apartment) can be 
defined in both the intra-floor and inter-floor levels to form a 
3D cluster of small cells of an MNO o within a building. The 
allocated spectrum per MNO can then be reused for each 3D 
cluster of small cells of an MNO o to improve the spectrum 
utilization. for example, adopting [13], a minimum distance 
between co-channel small cells for the 28 GHz mmWave 
spectrum in the intra-floor level and inter-floor level, 
respectively, for any MNO o at any term 
trnw
can be expressed 
as follows [22].

3) Impact of frequency bands on spectrum exploitation:   
The distance-dependent path loss varies with a change in carrier 
frequency. In general, an increase in carrier frequency causes to 
increase the path loss. Since the usable mmWave frequencies 
range largely, there is a corresponding impact on the reuse of 
the mmWave spectrum. For example, the distance-dependent 
path loss for the 60 GHz mmWave band can be expressed as

      Hence, the 3D cluster size decreases with an increase in 
frequency, i.e., more reuse of the same amount of spectrum 
bandwidth at the 60 GHz band can be made than that of the 28 
GHz band for the same number of apartments in a building. 
Since there are other mmWave bands considered effective for 
the 5G and beyond mobile systems, including 26 GHz, 39 GHz, 
and 73 GHz, a detailed understanding of how the mmWave 
frequency bands impact their reuse in in-building scenarios is 
necessary [22], which we consider addressing as further studies.   
4) MmWave spectrum allocation and reuse in outdoor 
environments:    In this paper, we limit investigating the 
proposed countrywide mmWave spectrum allocation and reuse 
technique to indoor SBSs deployed in multistory buildings. 
However, the propagation characteristics of mmWave signals 
in outdoor environments differ greatly from those in indoor 
ones, particularly, rain and atmospheric absorption effect, cell 
coverage, shadowing effect from large buildings, outage 
probability, user density, and speed, and mobility and handover 
management. All these aspects have a significant impact on the 
allocation and reuse of the mmWave spectrum outdoors. Hence, 
how to allocate the countrywide mmWave spectrum to each 
MNO in outdoor environments without causing CCI to each 
other and reuse the same mmWave spectrum for any MNO 
spatially need considerable research work [22]. We aim to 
address this issue of the mmWave spectrum allocation and 
reuse in outdoor environments in our future research studies. 
5) Effect of highly reflective environments:      In general, 
the presence of LOS components is higher and the effect of 
multi-path fading from reflections, refractions, and scattering is 
less in high-frequency mmWave than in low-frequency 
microwave signals. So, even though, for simplicity, we consider 
no effect of highly reflective environments such as furniture 
and metal walls, ventilation installations, and elevator cars in 
the performance analysis of indoors in this paper, in practice, 
there may be some effects from such highly reflective 
environments in high-frequency signals. This requires further 
investigations, which we consider for our future studies.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a countrywide millimeter-
wave (mmWave) spectrum allocation and reuse (CoMSAR) 
technique that considers assigning each MNO with the 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum countrywide at the cost of paying the 
spectrum licensing fee subject to avoiding co-channel 
interference (CCI). The assigned spectrum to each MNO is 
reused further to operate its small cells deployed on each floor 
in a multistory building. The amount of the spectrum licensing 
fee for an MNO is updated in accordance with its number of 
subscribers at each license renewal term. Moreover, CCI has 
been avoided by developing a frequency-domain CCI 
avoidance scheme that allocates UEs of different MNOs in an 
apartment on any floor of a building orthogonally to the 
countrywide 28 GHz mmWave spectrum. We have modeled 
user statistics per small cell and interferer statistics per 
apartment and formulated an expression for the optimal amount 
of spectrum of each MNO countrywide. By varying the impact 
of the CCI and the spectrum reuse, extensive numerical and 
simulation results and analyses have been carried out for an 
example scenario of a country consisting of four MNOs, i.e., 
MNO 1, MNO 2, MNO 3, and MNO 4 with a subscriber base 
of, respectively, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the total 
countrywide subscribers.  
It has been shown that the proposed technique with no CCI 
provides 2.5 times higher average capacity, SE, EE, and CE 
performances than that with the maximum CCI.  Furthermore, 
with regard to the SLSA, the proposed technique improves the 
average capacity, SE, EE, and CE of MNO 1 by 300%, 165%, 
75%, and 60%, respectively, with no CCI. The improvement 
factors, however, decrease as CCI increases and reaches the 
minimum value when CCI is the maximum. Besides, the 
required SE and EE for 6G can be achieved by changing either 
vertical RF 
FL
 or horizontal RF L such that their product, i.e., 
(
FL
×L), defines the achievable SE and EE performances. 
Further, the impact of CCI can be compensated by adjusting 
either vertical RF or horizontal RF. Furthermore, it has been 
shown that the proposed CoMSAR technique can satisfy both 
the SE of 370 bps/Hz and EE of 0.3 µJ/bit for 6G mobile 
systems by reusing the countrywide 28 GHz mmWave 
spectrum to small cells of MNO 1 of about 61.2% less number 
of single-floor buildings with no CCI, whereas 6.4% less 
number of single-floor buildings with the maximum CCI, than 
that required by the traditional SLSA technique. Lastly, we 
have discussed the benefits of the proposed technique and 
pointed out a number of issues as part of further studies on the 
proposed CoMSAR technique.
