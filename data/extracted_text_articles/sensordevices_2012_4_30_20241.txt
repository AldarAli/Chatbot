Abstract—Surface acoustic waves have been studied for more
than 50 years and are mainly used as passive components
(resonators, frequency ﬁlters, sensors, etc.) for signal pro-
cessing, and more speciﬁcally. As demonstrated by Bao et
al, surface acoustic wave devices can operate without on-
board power supply using a dedicated interrogation unit. Using
appropriate design considerations, these devices are sensitive to
external conditions including temperature, pressure, strain or
chemical/biological mass loading. Therefore, the unique charac-
teristics of such devices allows for an effective implementation
providing new opportunities for remote control of physical and
chemical parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION
The work presented in this paper has been achieved
within the SAWHOT European project frame [1], devoted to
the development of sensor and interrogation system for an
unprecedented temperature range (from cryogenic conditions
to temperature in excess of 650oC). In the following, the
development of temperature sensors operating from room
to high temperature is described, the application concern-
ing high temperature furnace monitoring, turbine operation
control. Two different types of substrate have been used for
the fabrication of SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) sensors to
assess ﬁrst the possibility for accurate measurements using a
differential structure, second to reach temperatures in excess
of 700oC using a single resonator sensor to demonstrate
the capability of these devices to withstand such operation
conditions. Quartz [2] and Langasite-based [3] solutions
have been respectively implemented in that purpose [4].
The ﬁrst part of the paper brieﬂy recalls the principle
of wireless SAW sensors. Design rules are subsequently
reported considering the speciﬁc problem of temperature
robustness. Particularly, the speciﬁc problem of packaging
and antenna assembly is discussed. The ﬁnal sections are
devoted to effective temperature measurements in the above-
mentioned ranges. As a conclusion, the capability of LGS-
based sensors to reach temperature in excess of 700oC is
discussed.
II. WIRELESS SAW SENSOR INTERROGATION PRINCIPLE
SAW sensors are based either on delay lines on Lithium
Niobate operating in the Industrial-Scientiﬁc-Medical (ISM)
2.45 GHz band or on resonators working at lower frequen-
cies, i.e. ISM bands centered in 434, 868 or 915 MHz. For
the later case, the basic principle of the interrogation strategy
is a combination of a frequency-sweep network analyzer
used to identify the resonance frequencies of the device, and
a monostatic pulse-mode RADAR strategy [5] for improving
the isolation between emission and reception stages. The
whole interrogation system is usually called reader as it
actually reads the resonance frequencies. A radio-frequency
pulse gates a carrier at variable frequencies within the ISM
band. If the emitted pulse spectrum overlaps the bandpass of
one resonator, the acoustic device stores the energy. Once the
antenna of the interrogation unit switched from the emission
to the reception stages of the reader, the resonator restores
the loaded energy at its own resonance frequency, shifting
with the variation of the physical parameter measured by
the resonator [6]. This pulse is received by the interrogation
unit using a wideband power detector. The returned power
vs frequency curves allows for the identiﬁcation of the
resonance frequency [7].
III. SAW SENSOR DESIGN FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE
MEASUREMENTS
An important knowledge has been developed for 20 years
based on work devoted to the simulation and computation of
surface acoustic wave devices (SAW), [8]. The two mainly
exploited methods are FEM (Finite Element Method) [9]
and BEM (Boundary Element method) [10], both combined
to accurately represent effective SAW boundary conditions.
FEM is used to account for the inhomogeneous part of
the transducer whereas of BEM is used to represent the
contribution of the substrate. This later function is achieved

Two high temperature ranges are targeted, below and over
500oC. For “low temperature”, sensors based on Quartz are
used with aluminum-copper electrodes allowing for high
quality factor resonances (≥ 10000) [11]. Regarding the
Curie temperature of Quartz, this material can not be used
at temperature higher than 573oC (limited to 540oC in
practice); therefore Langasite (lanthanum gallium silicate)
substrate [12] has been chosen for temperature measurement
over 500oC [13], [14].
Quartz sensors used for ﬁrst tests are TSEAS10 (5x5
mm2, Fig. 2) from SENSeOR (Mougins, France), this device
uses two resonators for differential measurements reducing
the inﬂuence of correlated noise and aging effect on the re-
sponse. SAW devices based on Quartz with Al-Cu electrodes
provide high Q factor as required for wireless interrogation
considering the capability of the sensor to store energy from
the RF wave, and to restore it at its own frequency depending
of environmental physical parameters [15].
Fig. 2 shows a quasi-perfect match between the simulation
and the experiment for this type of sensor (association of
quartz substrate with aluminum for interdigital transducers,
IDT).
IV. PACKAGING OF SAW DEVICES FOR HIGH
TEMPERATURE
Packaging is one key-point of the project. The device must
be mounted on a carrier to avoid applying any stress on the
device. Therefore, package and substrate materials require
coefﬁcients of thermal expansion as close one another as
possible. The whole package is composed of a standard
SMD ceramic case with tungsten/molybdenum pads (Ky-

ocera 7.1*9.1 mm2 A440), connected to device by gold wire-
bonding (Fig. 3).
Figure 3.
The different stages of the packaging process.
At the moment, devices are sealed using another upside-
down package as lid. The case is connected to an alumina
plate with patterned connection, this footprint is realized in
AgPb alloy to avoid the migration of the solder, stainless
steel antennas and case are connected to the pattern thanks
to tin solder.
An additional conditioning is required to preserve the
device integrity when exposed to high temperature. The
corresponding process is currently under patent application
process and will be described when presented at the confer-
ence.
V. TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WITH SAW SENSORS
BASED ON QUARTZ
The ﬁrst experiment helps us to understand what happens
to Quartz-based sensor between 25 oC and 250 oC.
The interrogator includes adapted SAW ﬁlters yielding
operating in the 434MHz-centered ISM frequency band
(434 MHz±0.85MHz). The algorithm used by the reader
is based on the separation of the above 1.7MHz band in
two equilibrated frequency sub-bands. Each resonance of
the differential sensor is located in one of the band for
the whole temperature excursion. The problem in our case
is that the sensor is used out of its speciﬁcations (room
temperature to 250oC instead of -15oC to 165oC); therefore

the resonance frequencies are overlapping over 180oC. With
this algorithm, the ﬁrst band begins at 433.05MHz and
ﬁnishes at 433.89MHz, while the second band starts at
433.89MHz and stops at 434.83MHz. Each band is used to
measure only one frequency. if two resonance frequencies
arise in the same band, the measured signal is the one
with the largest amplitude. On Fig. 4, the ﬁrst frequency
(green curve) is leaving the upper band to penetrates the
second one (>434 MHz), the power received by the reader
corresponding to this resonance is larger than for the other
one (red curve).
The second experiment aims at using Quartz sensor at
temperature up to 450oC without frequency band program
of the reader (the contrary of the last experiment), providing
the ﬂexibility needed to measure SAW sensors out of their
speciﬁcations.

Figure 5.
Behavior of resonator at intermediate temperature (around
450oC).
The sensor is based on differential measurements, but
the two corresponding resonators do not exhibit the same
behavior versus temperature. The 434 MHz frequency (blue
between 0 and 5000s) is the reference mode exhibiting
less frequency variation than the sensor mode (433 MHz)
corresponding to the sensor mode. The turnover of the
reference mode is situated in the temperature range from
room temperature to 200oC, then, the frequency is dra-
maticaly decreasing as shown from 5000s to 10000s. The
turnover of the other mode is situated at higher temperature,
therefore the frequency shift of this mode versus temperature
is less important than for the reference mode. The higher
frequency is crossing the other resonance between 5000s
and 7500s, then both frequencies have changed their places
in the frequency band when the oven stoped to heat up
at 22500s. With this later algorithm, the reader is able
to measure frequencies, which are separated from at least
200 kHz (depending of the averages number performed and
the frequency band measured,considering 150 steps in a 4
MHz wideband, each “valid” measure separated by 7 steps).
More experiments have been led on Quartz-based sensors to
evaluate if a solution with this substrate can be an alternative
to high temperature substrate at intermediate temperatures
(room temperature to 500oC). As shown on Fig. 6, this
resonator suffered 50h at 450oC without visible damages.

VI. AGING AND TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WITH
SAW SENSORS BASED ON LANGASITE
The ﬁrst steps of the experiments are focusing on the
evaluation of the efﬁciency of the wireless sensor at inter-
mediate (Fig. 8), and then at high temperature (Fig. 13).
Moreover, the frequency measurements of the devices will
help understanding and evaluating the frequency variations
of the resonators. The necessity of a “preaging” process for
Langasite sensors then will be emphasized.
For the ﬁrst experiment, the resonator was placed in a
ceramic oven (able to warm up up to 1200oC, Fig7).
The resonator has been submitted at a temperature of
500oC during 50h. Meanwhile, its resonance frequency has
been wirelessly monitored with a refreashing rate of about
one measurement per second.
As expected, the temperature cycle applied to the res-
onator did operate as an aging process and the frequency of
the resonator has evolved. As shown on Fig. 8, a difference
of 300 kHz is observed at room temperature before and after
the 50h-500oC cycle (at dates 50000s and 320000s). The
frequency is shifting along time (during the 500oC heating
process), showing a difference of 50 kHz between the dates

Between 0s and 50000s, the sensor is packaged (Fig3) and placed in the
oven for a ﬁrst preliminary cycle (100oC for 2h, 270oC for 2h and 360oC
for 2h). Between 80000s and 280000s, the sensor withstands a temperature
of 500oC.

of the measured frequency is 10 kHz.
The resonator then is used at 700oC to push ahead the
experiment (Fig. 9) and to continue to estimate the observed
shift of the frequency.

Wireless measurement of the sensor at 700oC. Between 0s and
18000s, the oven is warming up. The sensor is then operating at 700oC
during 36000s (from 18000s to 54000s), then the sensor does not operate
anymore.
After 10h of measurements, the interrogator does not
measure any response. In order to determine the origin of the
failure, the package has been opened and it was identiﬁed
a break of the wire-bonding induced by the deformation of
the metallization used for the connection pad of the case.
Concerning data acquired during these 10h of operation, the
signal is too noisy to determine the frequency shift. As a
conclusion, this resonator was able to operate during 50h at
500oC and then 10h more at 700oC. The noise measured
during both experiments (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) is related to
the laboratory activities. Note that the resonator was still
operating when probed with tips.
In parallel, another resonator was used for stabilizing a
temperature controlled oscillator based on a Collpits-like
structure. The device was placed in the oscillation loop
once dicing process performed without any preaging. This
resonator (Fig. 10) showed a Q factor of 5000 with a
coupling factor of 0.04%. The temperature of the system
was locked at 50oC. This test was performed to estimate
aging effects of LGS resonators used at room temperature
to corroborate the need for pre-aging process application in
general.

Regarding the frequency variation curve (Fig. 11) and
the frequency variation at intermediate temperature (Fig. 8),
the langasite based devices would need the development
of a “preaging” process to reduce as much as possible the
frequency shift of the sensor in harsh environments.
For the second experiment, a different resonator is used
for life time tests, regarding the low (10-20 cm) range
induced by its “low” coupling coefﬁcient (0.19%, low com-
pared to the other devices issued of the same wafer) and its
low Q factor (<500), it is not possible to use this sensor
for wireless measurement. The resonator is placed in the
oven with another case up and down as hood, this package
will protect the resonator against a direct contact with high
temperature environment (as it will be in packaged device
for wireless measurements).
The sensor is measured using tip-prober between each
successive cycle to evaluate the impact of the temperature
on the response of the device. The temperature cycle used
in this experiment is composed of a 5h warming from room
temperature to 700oC, and then keeping the temperature
constant during 10h.

As shown on Fig. 12, the dynamics of the resonator
admittance is changing along cycles . The coupling coefﬁ-
cient of the device remains constant despite successive cycle
application. However, after 4 cycles, no more response is
measured.
The third experiment aims at using langasite sensors in
high temperature environment (>500 oC). The goal of this
experiment is to observe the evolution of the resonance
frequency at 700oC (Fig13) and to evaluate the effect of
operating in harsh environment on the response of the
device.

Behavior of a langasite sensor. The experiment cycle is divided
in 3 steps, 300 oC, 500 oC and 700 oC for 2h at each temperature.
Considering the used resonator, the frequency band of the
reader had to be adapted and a wide band interrogator was
used (440 MHz ± 10 MHz instead of classical conﬁguration
434 MHz ± 0.85 MHz). As expected, the frequency band
needed to measure the behavior of the Langasite sensor was
around 10 MHz (441 MHz at room temperature versus 430.5
MHz at 700oC).The frequency of the resonator decreases
by 300 kHz after each step at 700oC, as shown in Fig. 13,
the frequency is only shifting at “low” temperature (room,
300oC, 500oC), the evolution of the frequency at 700oC
after each process is less signiﬁcant (50 kHz). After this
last experiment, the sensor was not able to operate anymore.
The package has been opened to analyzed what happened
to the device (Fig. 14 and Fig. 15). It appears that the fail
is coming from the destruction of the IDT induced by a too
long exposure at high temperature [16], [17], [18].

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In the frame of the SAWHOT project, SAW devices for
wireless passive high temperature measurements have been
developed. Two main operating range have been identiﬁed,
from room temperature to 500oC and beyond 500oC. For
both ranges of temperature, sensors have been developed,
starting from basic design opertaion (using FEM/BEM and
mixed-matrix-based tools) to characterization in oven using
wireless measurements. Simulated results did match with
devices behavior when measured via tip-probing. Quartz-
based sensors were found suitable for intermadiate temper-
ature measurements (<500oC). This type of sensor shows
that this range of temperature can be measured using Al-
Cu electrode on SAW Quartz resonators, withy numer-
ous degree-of-freedom for optimizing speciﬁcations such
as sensitivity, frequency range and the number of res-
onators (differential measurements or not). The algorithm
for resonance frequency tracking prevents the overlapping of
both measured resonators. For high temperature (>500oC),
Langasite-based sensors were found to operate up to 700oC.
The ﬁrsts experiments have been done using a wideband
reader, according to the frequency/temperature range. The
results show that the sensors can be actually measured at
700oC using SENSeOR’s interrogator with a 30 cm range
interrogation distance (across the oven back). The resonance
frequency of the sensor is evolving at high temperature,
showing a decrease of 300 kHz of the frequency after
each cycle at room temperature, 300oC, 500oC. At 700oC,
the shift of frequency is reduced and is around 50 kHz.
Moreover, the langasite device has been able to operate at
this temperature for 30h, during this period, the dynamic
admittance is increasing, while the coupling coefﬁcient
remains constant.
Further works are currently performed, focusing on the
upgrading of the sensor parameters (Q factor, coupling
coefﬁcient), the life time of sensor at high temperature and
the aging process for the devices.
