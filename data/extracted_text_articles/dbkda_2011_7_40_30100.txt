Abstract— In the present competitive telecom scenario, an 
intention of any operator is to increase the size of the network 
and establish more connectivity between its users. This can be 
achieved either by adding new customers to the network or by 
increasing number of links in the network. In this paper, we 
present a method called triad formation for increasing the 
connectivity in the network. Community detection has been 
done on the network before to set up the triads for efficient 
results. The communities formed are based on the modularity 
factor. The proposed method will resolve possible new 
combination of edges between nodes which are not connected 
earlier and it has a strong connection with a common node. 
The effectiveness of the triad formation is demonstrated on a 
huge telecom data and its importance is highlighted.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
A social network is a compact structure which explores 
connected groups and it is used to predict the actions of 
individuals. These individuals in a network are called nodes 
and their communications are measured in the form of 
dependent edges. Dependency varies from friendship, 
common interests, beliefs and knowledge. One of the utmost 
interests of telecom operators is to increase the connectivity 
between customers to generate more profit. For this, they 
need to identify the existence of strong connections and 
influential members based on the mobile usage services. 
Mobile Social Network Analysis (MSNA) is an upcoming 
research area which indicates the importance of identifying 
the social groups in mobile networks [1]. It helps the 
operators in understanding and analysing the subscribers 
and increases the focus on their business. MSNA has proved 
to give extensive results in the areas like churn prediction, 
customer retention and campaign management [2]. 
The behaviour of highly connected customers and their 
relationship mainly depends on the social structure of the 
communities. With the help of social network analysis it is 
possible to find the potential users, influential members and 
weak users of a community [3]. The real challenge in 
telecom networks is it dimension. Processing millions of 
nodes and billions of edges is not only a tough task, but also 
a time taking process. One of the solutions to this challenge 
would be detecting communities and then performing 
analysis on individual communities which will derive 
efficient results. Community detection can be done based on 
common interests of the subscribers and their calling 
patterns. There are several interesting algorithms for 
community detection available which can segment the 
network based on modularity [3, 4, 5]. Modularity is a prime 
factor which defines the strength of a community. CNM 
algorithm is one of its kind which helps in finding 
communities using a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm 
for detecting community structure which is faster than many 
competing algorithms [4]. CNM algorithm works on 
undirected edges in a network. Hence, whenever it runs 
through a cycle in the network, the algorithm runs into an 
infinite loop and leads to a memory constraint and stops 
working. The algorithm has been slightly modified to solve 
this problem. 
We propose a novel idea on new group formation called 
triads, which finds nodes which were not connected earlier 
and where there is a high probability of forming new edges 
between them because they have a strong common node. By 
doing this, the number of edges (number of calls) increase 
which in turn leads to increase in revenue for the operator. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to 
generate new edges in a telecom network at a community 
level. The main contribution of our research is based on the 
telecom data obtained from the Call Data Records (CDRs) 
which are used for community detection and formation of 
triads. The communities which are formed with higher 
modularity help the operator to understand its customers as 
a group and it is easy to analyse the behaviour of potential 
customers. 
The first and foremost step is to clean the data to avoid 
the redundant and unnecessary attributes. The attributes of 
CDRs which are taken into consideration are Calling 
Number, Called Number and Duration of the call. This 
cleansed data will be used as input for the modified CNM 
algorithm which will detect communities. Once the 
communities with high modularity are detected, the task of 
finding nodes which have high probability in making new 
edges is easy which will lead to the formation of triadic 
closure [5] in mobile networks. A brief stepwise description 
of our research work is as follows 
A. Data Pre-processing 
First and foremost step is to clean data or in other terms 
filter out those set of attributes from CDRs which are not 
used in the next step of our research. In a telecom scenario 
for every call made, a CDR is generated. Records related to 
the calls made to toll free numbers and call centres should 
be filtered out. Records indicating voice calls are collected. 
Our study on triadic formation is based only on voice calls. 
B. Classification of users 
To enrich the results and to achieve a better accuracy, it 
is suggested to classify users into weak and potential users. 
It is a challenging task for an operator to find out its active 
or potential users who add weight to their network. Such 
classification rules would solve the problem and does make

it easy to identify related users and in order helps to 
understand their behaviour and also the behaviour of the 
community the user is related to. It is at the ease of operator 
to customize the rules and classify the users based on his 
need. 
C. Community Detection 
Communities are formed based on the increase or gain in 
the modularity when nodes merge [6]. This is a recursive 
step and stops when there is no more gain in the modularity. 
Unlike other greedy algorithms, data structures have been 
used to handle sparse adjacency matrices. 
D. Identifying Isolated Communities 
Communities of a network which do not have any edge 
or connection to other communities are called isolated 
communities. The users of these communities do not have 
any edges or connections to other community members. The 
total number of inter-community calls is zero. Communities 
which have more than one edge or connection to other 
communities are called non-isolated communities. The need 
for identifying isolated communities drills down the 
problem of understanding the customers, as the behaviour of 
an isolated community depends on the behaviour of the 
alpha user of that community. This is the major advantage 
of isolated communities. An alpha user is a highly potential 
node who influences the community [1] and the community 
behaviour can be concluded based on the alpha user’s 
behaviour and the time taken to spread the information to 
the network from this point is minimal. Another major 
advantage of an isolated community is that the community 
does not get disturbed by external factors. 
E.  Generation of New Edges 
This is the final step of our research work. Generating 
new edges between nodes which are not connected and 
which have a strong common node. 
 
 
Figure 1 
Triad formation 
This step is called triad formation which is represented 
in Fig. 1. It shows three users A, B and C where User B is 
the common node. The edge AB whose edge weight is 
represented by w1 and edge BC whose edge weight is 
represented by w2 are the existing edges and the dotted edge 
AC denote the newly generated edge. The edge weight w3 
of edge AC is generated. 
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, 
we review the related literatures and in Section III, we 
describe the procedure of experiment at different stages. 
Section IV gives our experiment results followed by 
discussion in Section V and concluding remarks and future 
work in Section VI.

RELATED WORK 
Understanding the customers and making them feel 
comfortable without creating any disruption in the network 
is considered to be the top most priority of any network 
provider. Mobile Social Network Analysis (MSNA) is an 
evolving research area where many challenges like finding 
influential members in network or community, detecting 
community of high modularity, understanding the behavior 
of a community, churn prediction are yet to find perfect 
solutions. In this section we describe some important studies 
which laid roots to community detection and triadic 
formation in mobile networks. 
A. Stanley six degree experiment 
Stanley Milgram is famously known for his ―Small 
World Phenomenon‖ [7]. He routed messages in a network 
based on the familiarity of the first name and deduced to an 
interesting result which states that any person can be 
reached by any other person by not more than six hops. In 
simple terms, distant people can be connected by short paths 
in which every edge connects two people who know each 
other quite well. The data considered in this experiment was 
not as complex as the telecom data. This experiment has 
provoked us to experiment with mobile networks to explore 
the existence of knitted communities. Recent work has 
suggested that this phenomenon has effect in networks 
arising from nature and technology, and is a fundamental 
ingredient in the structural evolution of the World Wide 
Web. Such experiments on telecom network would give us 
an idea about the structure of the network. The number of 
hops or the time taken for information or message to 
exchange between any two random nodes can be deduced. 
B. Pareto’s 80/20 rule 
It states that 20% of landowners own 80% of the land, 
20% of the workers do 80% of the work, 20% of criminals 
carry out 80% of the crime and 20% of websites get 80% of 
the traffic. This rule when tuned to the telecom network it 
will give us an idea that 20% of our customers make 80% of 
our business [8]. Identifying these set of customers is one of 
the challenges as mentioned previously and these customers 
are called alpha users in many studies. 
C. Community Detection 
There have been many community detection algorithms 
seen in recent times. CNM algorithm [4] is one of the best 
of its kind. It is a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm 
which iteratively merges nodes into communities based on 
the gain in modularity. Its running time on a network with n 
vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the height 
149

of the dendogram. Fast unfolding [9] is another community 
detection algorithm based on modularity. It is divided into 
two phases where in the first phase every node has its 
community number. Then the modularity is calculated with 
respect to all its neighbors. If there is positive gain in the 
modularity then the nodes are merged. 
The CNM algorithm at this point has to be modified 
accordingly in order to meet few exceptions. The algorithm 
is purely based on graph theory where it considers every 
user as a node. It does not work under the condition where a 
loop exists between two nodes. A loop in telecom network 
can be understood as a bi-directional edge between two 
users. In order to solve this problem the algorithm has been 
slightly modified to consider the directional edges. 
Whenever such situations are raised the source and 
destination are swapped in order to overcome the loop as the 
bidirectional edge is made into two unidirectional edges. 
D. Triadic closure 
Triadic closure is a concept in social network theory, 
first suggested by German sociologist Georg Simmel in the 
early 1990s. It is a property between 3 nodes A, B and C. 
Suppose there exists a strong tie between A-B and B-C, then 
there will be a weak or strong tie between A-C. In [5], Mark 
Granvotter has synthesized the theory called ―Cognitive 
Balance‖ which refers to the tendency of two individuals 
who feel the same way about an object. If the triad between 
three nodes is not closed, then the node connected to both 
the nodes has the ability to close this triad in order to 
complete the closure in the relationship network. 
III. 
PROCEDURE  
A stepwise presentation of our research work has been 
presented in this section. The unnecessary records from 
CDRs are filtered out and for better results the users are 
classified into active and potential users. After the users are 
classified into the mentioned categories, they are used as 
input data for the community detection algorithm which 
results to isolated and non-isolated communities. The last 
step which is the major part of our research is the generation 
of new edges between nodes which are not connected and 
have a strong common node. The new edges which are 
generated complete the triad formation. 
A. Data processing  
The telecom data used here had 1.2 million CDRs from 
African Telecom operator. This data includes the CDRs 
related to voice, SMS, GRPS. The data used here was over 
duration of week. Our research is carried only on voice calls 
and hence the first step is to filter out all the call records 
related only to voice calls. The next step of data cleaning is 
to identify the called numbers which have an outdegree 0 or 
indegree 0. Outdegree 0 can be defined as the caller ID 
which in all cases is the destination of call and not a source. 
Indegree 0 can be defined as the caller ID which in all cases 
is the source of call and never a destination.

As the caller ID’s are nearly 10 digits in length, 
processing them at every step is yet another time consuming 
process. Unique ID’s were given to the users to overcome 
this problem. 
B. Classification of users 
The filtered data from the processing step is used for this 
step. The attributes used are Calling Number, Called 
Number and Time Duration. The data has 1,82,000 distinct 
users. 
Users have been classified into weak and potential users 
based on their calling patterns and their behavior in the 
network. Thresholds have been set on Indegree (number of 
calls received) and Outdegree (number of calls made). 
Certain rules have been followed in order to classify the 
users accordingly. These rules are user specific and depend 
on the data used. The rules designed by us are on the basis 
of the 7 days data on which we carried our experiments. The 
following are the rules laid down by us which classify a user 
as a potential user: 
 
1)  User has to be active on any 4 days of the week , 
2)  Indegree of the user should be greater than or equal to 
10, 
3)  Outdegree of the user should be greater than or equal 
to 10,  
4) Sum of indegree and outdegree should be greater than 
or equal to 20. 
 
The basis for the rules is as follows: 
Rule 1) User has to be active on any 4 days of the week: 
We found an interesting pattern on observing the data 
over the duration of the data. Some of the users were active 
only on the first day of the week, some are active on the last 
day of the week and most of the users were active for an 
average of 4 days of the week. This has been calculated by 
noting down the availability (A) and non-availability (NA) 
of the user over a week. The presence of a user j on a day i 
is defined as Pij . The value of Pij is 1 if the user is present 
on day i else it is assigned 0. The Average Active Period 
(AAP) is defined as 
 
𝐴𝐴𝑃 =

𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠
𝑖
 
𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠
𝑗
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠   
(1) 
 
Rule 2) Indegree of the user should be greater than or 
equal to 10:  
Fig. 2 plots the net indegree or number of calls received 
by every user over a week and average indegree of a user 
over a week turned out to be 10. The horizontal axis is 
indicated by the users of the network by their distinct ID’s 
and the vertical axis has the Indegree of every user. 
 
Rule 3) Outdegree of the user should be greater than or 
equal to 10: 
Fig. 3 plots the net outdegree or number of calls made by

every user over a week and average outdegree of a user over 
a week turned out to be 10. The horizontal axis is indicated 
by the users of the network by their distinct ID’s and the 
vertical axis has the Outdegree of every user. 
 
Figure 2 Indegree Vs User Id 
 
Figure 3 Outdegree Vs User Id 
 Rule 4) Sum of indegree and outdegree should be 
greater than or equal to 20: 
This rule has the roots from rule 2 and 3. The sum of 
average indegree and average outdegree leads to 20. This 
rule has been made to ensure that we do not have users who 
just receive calls or make calls.  
 
User who satisfies all the four rules is classified as 
potential users and the rest are called weak users. The latter 
are not considered as input set for further steps in the study. 
These users might increase the revenue of the network but 
the network or community does not shatter once they churn 
out and these set of users cannot be exactly put into a 
particular community. Addition of these users in the 
collection might lead into biased results. Following are the 
examples for weak users 
 
1) Call-Center: The indegree of every call center is high 
when compared to its outdegree. It is impossible to 
categorize them into a particular community 
2) Business scheme promoters: The indegree in this case 
is negligibly small when compare to its outdegree. These set 
of users are also considered as weak users. 
 
At the end of this stage our data set consists of only 
active users. Calling number, called number and duration of 
the call are the only attributes which are being used. At the 
beginning of this step we had 1,82,000 distinct users, and 
after classification only 68,000 users are classified as active. 
C. Community Detection 
Community detection has been the toughest challenge in 
research area in present days. CNM performs the same 
greedy optimization as the algorithm [10] . What makes this 
perform better than the existing one is the way it handles the 
sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are faced in the early stages 
of formation of adjacency matrices and this operation is 
efficiently carried out in CNM using data structures for 
sparse matrices. 
The calling number and the called number are taken as 
inputs for the community detection algorithm. CNM 
algorithm [4] is used for community detection. It is a 
hierarchical agglomeration algorithm which detects the 
com-munity structure and is faster than many competing 
algorithms. Initially every node is considered as a 
community and adjacency matrix Avw is generated for that 
network. 𝛿(cv, cw) denotes the connectivity. 𝛿 equals 1 if 
there exist an edge, else it is 0. The number of edges m in 
the graph and vertex x belonging to community cv is given 
by 
 
                     𝑚 =
1
2  
𝑣𝑤 𝐴𝑣𝑤𝛿(𝑐𝑣, 𝑐𝑤) 
  
(2) 
 
The fraction of edges making one community is given 
by 
 
 
 𝐴𝑣𝑤 𝛿(𝑐𝑣,𝑐𝑤 )
𝑣,𝑤
 
𝑣,𝑤 𝐴𝑣𝑤  
= 
1
2𝑚  
𝑣𝑤 𝐴𝑣𝑤𝛿(𝑐𝑣, 𝑐𝑤) 
 
(3) 
 
Modularity is the main parameter which is taken into 
consideration when the communities are made. The fraction 
is directly proportional to the probability of the two edges 
merging into one community. Degree kv of vertex v is 
defined as the number of edges leading to it, then the 
modularity (Q) is defined as 
 
𝑄 = 
1
2𝑚  
 𝐴𝑣𝑤 −
𝑘𝑣𝑘𝑤
2𝑚  𝛿 𝑐𝑤, 𝑖 
𝑣𝑤
 
(4) 
 
The input handling has been changed to avoid the 
algorithm from running into an infinite loop. Eqn. 5 shows 
that CNM algorithm [4] works only for undirected edges. 
Every edge in telecom network is directed. In other terms 
every edge in telecom network has a source (calling 
number) and destination (called number). CNM does not 
identify such edges and considers them as undirected edge 
which leads the algorithm into an infinite loop. The 
modification which is made into it was at the input stage for 
algorithm. The input file format is a list of called and calling 
numbers. 
𝛿 𝑐𝑣, 𝑐𝑤 =  𝛿(𝑐𝑣, 𝑖)𝛿(𝑐𝑤, 𝑖)

The condition checkpoint which was introduced here is: 
If there exists an edge as A to B and B to A then swap B and 
A in the second case or else there would be an infinite loop 
between A to B and algorithm stops working. Once the 
nodes are swapped in the second case there will only be 2 
copies of edges between A and B which resulted in 
dissection of loop which solves the problem. Upon every 
merge, the rows and columns of the corresponding 
communities are blended. Alternate way is to store the 
difference in the values of the modularity which result from 
the conglomeration of communities. Choose the largest 
among them and perform amalgamation. This would result 
in lesser memory storage and computational cost as these 
are the main hurdles when we are dealing with huge data. 
The strongest user of a community is the alpha user of 
the community [1]. Definition of alpha user varies from 
research and its usage. In our research it is defined as the 
user of a community on whose removal there is a high 
probability of the network getting shattered off. The user is 
highly connected to most of the users in that community. 
The user has the capability to spread the information in less 
time. 
D. Isolated and Non-Isolated Communities 
Every community formed is given a unique ID. Every 
community is now considered as a node and the degree of 
the community is calculated. No of edges from a particular 
community to other community is defined as the degree. If 
the degree is equal to 0 then it is called an isolated com-
munity else a non-isolated community. Higher the number 
of isolated communities, higher is the modularity of the 
community as modularity is defined as the ratio of number 
of isolated communities to the total number of communities 
formed. Isolated communities are those whose members 
make calls only to their community members and make no 
calls to any other community members. 
E. Generation of New edges 
All the communities and the community members along 
with their respective CDRs which contain the calls made by 
them or call received by them along with the duration are 
taken as input. We have presented the algorithm related to 
the generation of new edges in mobile telecom networks. 
 
Algorithm A graph G = (V, E) with V>0 and E>0 
 
1) Look for two nodes x, y that are non-adjacent and share 
a common neighbor 
2) If no such pair of nodes x, y exists, go to step 8, else 
goto step 3 
3) The edge weight between x and the common neighbor is 
labeled as w1 
4) The edge weight between y and the common neighbor is 
labeled as w2 
5) Check if w1 and w2 are more than the threshold weight 
set by the user 
6) If not go to step 8, else goto step 7 
7) Add edge(x, y) and assign a weight equivalent to 
average of w1 and w2 
8) Add element x, y to set E 
9) Go to step 1. 
 
The implementation of the algorithm is as follows: 
 
Formation of new edges between nodes which are not 
connected and have a strong common node in between is the 
motto of the algorithm. To enhance our results, we will 
concentrate on every community individually and try to 
form new edges in between users of the community. These 
nodes can be easily joined because they belong to the same 
community. Certain rules have been laid down in computing 
such edges. Let’s say there are three nodes A, B, and C as 
shown in Fig. 1, where AB and BC are connected and B is 
the common node. Weight of the edge AB is w1 and weight 
of the edge BC is w2. A new edge AC will be formed if and 
only if w1 and w2 are more than the threshold weight. This 
threshold weight is user specific. This is used to define 
whether the edges w1 and w2 (already existing edges) are 
strong or weak. Once this new edge is formed its weight is 
defined as the average of w1 and w2. Formation of new 
edges not only increase the weight of the structure but also 
increase the closeness, clustering co-efficient, average talk 
time and average revenue of the community. The 
betweenness values of the community decreases which 
actually indicates that the probability of the network getting 
disturbed when a node or user moves to other network is 
less. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The section describes the results achieved. The result 
consists of communities deduced with high modularity over 
duration of seven days. Another experiment which was 
carried on was to find out the behavior of communities over 
two time periods, namely weekends and weekdays. The 
alpha members of every community have been highlighted 
using Pajek software [11] which is a tool used for network 
analysis and visualization. In the last section we have 
presented the results on triads using a community of size 
339 nodes as network.

Table I shows the behavior of communities that are 
formed over three time periods namely weekdays, weekends 
and over a week. It is shown that the communities that are 
formed on weekends have better modularity, mean size and 
max than when compared to the communities formed on 
weekdays. This is because the users in the network are 
active over the weekends. The above table shows attributes 
of communities that are formed over two time periods 
namely weekdays and weekends. Communities that are 
formed on weekends have a better modularity, mean size 
and max size than the communities formed on weekdays. 
This is because the number of calls and the duration of calls 
are high over the weekends.  
Table II shows the number of communities and their 
respective degrees. As mentioned earlier a community with 
degree 0 is called an isolated community where the users 
belonging to that community only make intra-community 
calls. 
 
Interesting results which were deduced by the formation 
of community over a week 
 
1. 8510 out of 8533 communities are isolated  
2. Every community has an alpha member. Hence 
there are 8533 alpha members in the network  
3. Number of communities which have only one edge 
to other communities: 8

Table III describes the distribution of isolated 
communities over a week. Size of a community indicates the 
number of users in that particular community. 8374 
communities are of size less than 10, which indicates that 
there are more number of smaller communities when 
compared to communities of size 100. 
Fig. 4 represents the hierarchical representation of a 
community of users based on their net degree in ascending 
order from the top. This is a sample representation of one of 
the community whose size is 339. The node at the bottom of 
the diagram is the alpha member. It can be clearly seen that 
the number of connections between the alpha user to the 
other users in the community. The users at a particular level 
have equal degree.

DISCUSSION 
In this section, we discussed about the advantages of the 
research based on our experiment of triad formation with a 
community of size 339 nodes as an example. Various graph 
theory attributes [2] which depict the strength of a network 
have been calculated and compared under two scenarios 
namely before generation of new edges and after addition of 
new edges. 
The attributes which were used to show the success of 
our method are Closeness, Average talk time of the 
community, 
Average 
Revenue 
of 
the 
community, 
Betweenness and Modularity. Closeness is the inverse of 
sum of the shortest distances between each and every node 
in the network. Betweenness is a measure which depicts 
how much the network can be shattered if a person is 
inactive or churned. 
From Table IV, we infer the following: 
1) Closeness between nodes is increased by 48.4% from the 
earlier case which implies of how close the nodes are 
knitted. The shortest path between any two nodes has 
decreased and hence the there is an increase in the 
measure 
2) Average Talk time has increased by 30.4% as new edges 
lead to rise in number of calls.  
3) Average Revenue has increased by 31.6%. Number of 
calls has increased which will automatically trigger the 
revenue to higher levels.  
4) Betweenness has decreased by 0.45% which shows that 
the amount of shatter or disturbance caused by a 
particular user has lessened.  
5) There is not much increase in modularity as our model 
was of size 339 nodes and modularity would only 
increase if there are new users added to the community. 
In our cases we are only working on new edges. The 
increase of 0.08% can be explained as formation of one 
or two isolated communities as new edges have been 
formed.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the results we can conclude that all the steps 
followed in our experiment have enriched the results starting 
from the initial step of filtering out users who’s either 
indegree or outdegree is 0. Then our assumption of 
concentrating on active users would lead to better results has 
also been proven by achieving communities of higher 
modularity. Generation of new edges have been proved to 
be an advantage for the operator as it bonds its users much 
higher than the earlier stage which would in turn increase 
his revenue. Considering other parameters of CDR like 
SMS, GPRS, would lead us to find much more potential 
nodes which later can be used as data for our experiments. 
Moreover the Customer ranking can be considered at 
community level. The usage of location-based information 
can strengthen our claim of triad formation in mobile 
networks.
