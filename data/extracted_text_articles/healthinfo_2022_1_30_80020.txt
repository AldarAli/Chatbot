Abstract— In the framework of a research project funded by 
INCa (French National Institute for Cancer), a team of 
sociologists has conducted interviews with cancer outpatients, 
with the goal of analyzing their social support network and its 
evolution over time. This paper describes the ontology-driven 
tool supporting the collection and analysis of this sociological 
data. 
Keywords: Social support for outpatients; health ontologies.

INTRODUCTION 
The healthcare management of cancer has witnessed 
dramatical changes in the recent years. With the development 
of ambulatory treatments and oral chemotherapy, only 10% of 
anticancer chemotherapy in France is now performed in full 
hospitalization [1]. There is currently a reduction in 
hospitalization time, and conventional inpatient treatment is 
gradually replaced by other less expensive methods, such as 
home hospitalization or ambulatory care. 
Although outpatient medical care favours patient 
autonomy, it also leads to patients and their relatives carrying 
a new burden of responsibility in defining and implementing 
their own care pathways. In the framework of a research 
project funded by INCa (French National Institute for 
Cancer), a team of sociologists has conducted interviews with 
post-cancer outpatients, with the goal of assessing the main 
hypothesis that the success of a healthcare pathway is 
increasingly dependent on the "resources" that the patients can 
mobilize to come to terms with their illness. 
These resources are obtained within two major types of 
networks: those structured around the close relatives and those 
structured around friendly and professional relationships. The 
complexity of these networks may vary, and their structure is 
likely to partly explain the social dynamics observed in 
disease trajectories. This graph of resources and relationships 
defines the patient’s socio-technical network of support, co-
constructed by patients themselves, close acquaintances, 
health professionals, individual and social environment, and 
technologies.  
In the following sections, we present a tool designed to 
support the collection and sharing of the information gathered 
during interviews, and permitting a convenient visualization 
of the evolution of the patient’s social graph over time. 
II. 
TOOL SUPPORT 
In the framework of this project, we have developed a 
software tool allowing the sociologist investigators to analyze 
how cancer patients construct their healthcare pathway in 
connection with the medical care team, but also in continuous 
interaction with their social supports. At the start of the 
project, the sociologist partners were transcribing their 
interviews with patients using a structured Excel® sheet, 
which was fitted with a detailed usage guide, aimed at 
enhancing the homogeneity of transcriptions made by 
different investigators. Although this mode of transcription 
had several advantages (such as familiarity and flexibility) it 
proved ill-suited in the long term, mainly due to the use of 
different terminologies by the investigators, who were using 
various synonymous terms to transcribe the same resources or 
relationships, thus hampering the possibility of automatic 
treatment. 
 
To overcome these problems, and to enable the automatic 
processing and analysis of the recorded data, we developed a 
software tool, with the goal of preserving the flexibility of the 
original process, but also to favor the development and sharing 
of consistent terminologies between investigators. The tool 
enables a graphical edition of the patients’ social relationship 
network, which is conceived as a graph of resources and 
relationships between resources. 
Considering that the consistency of the terminologies used 
for labeling the resources and relationships are of prime 
importance for enabling further automatic processing, the 
conceptual design of the tool is based on ontological approach 
[2]. In order to reach the objectives of flexibility expressed by 
the investigators (and confirmed by the analysis of interviews 
in Excel format), the tool allows for the development of a 
dynamic ontology of resources and relationships, defined and 
controlled by the investigators themselves [3], [4].

A detailed analysis of interviews collected in Excel format 
led to the conceptual model illustrated in Figure 1, expressed 
in the Unified Modelling Notation (UML), and was mapped 
to a relational implementation using the principles described 
in [5]. For each patient under scrutiny, several interviews are 
conducted. During these interviews, the investigators identify 
the resources that are part of the social relationship network 
of the patient, and the relationships between these resources. 
To ensure the consistency of the interviews’ modelling, 
resources and relationships must be instances of a well-
defined ontology, which is illustrated in the right part of 
Figure 1. This dynamic ontology (ResourceType and 
RelationType) constitutes a meta-model for the social network 
graph of a patient, defining a consistent terminology for 
resource types (e.g., “informational resource”, or “medical 
act”), and for the legal relationships between resource types 
(e.g., the relation type “Information acquisition” mandatorily 
links a resource of type “person” to a resource of type 
“informational resource”. This metamodel can be dynamically 
extended by the investigators to accommodate new situations, 
or even be completely redesigned if a new study requires a 
change of focus regarding the information of interest.  
 
Resource types and relation types are organized as a 
covariant tree-structure of subtypes [7]. Thus, for instance, the 
“information acquisition” relationship could relate to a 
resource of type “Doctor”, which is a sub-type of “Person”. 
The software tool allows for a graphical edition of the social 
relationship graph (Figure 2), and the user interface permits 
an easy navigation between the successive interviews of a 
patient, which promotes a visual and intuitive evaluation of 
the evolution the patient’s social graph over time.

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
 
The tool has successfully replaced the spreadsheet-based 
data collection previously used, ensuring the consistency of 
terminologies 
amongst 
sociologist 
investigators 
and 
promoting the sharing of information. The ontology-driven 
design of the tool opens the possibility of automatic 
transformation of the collected data in Resource Description 
Framework (RDF) format [8], which enables the use of 
specific ontology request languages [9] to integrate network 
analysis algorithms [10], such as the identification of critical 
resources.
