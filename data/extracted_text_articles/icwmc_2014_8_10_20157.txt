Abstract—The competing priorities of safety critical messages
and infotainment messages present a signiﬁcant challenge when
designing effective IEEE 1609.4 protocol enhancements. In this
paper, we investigate the latency reduction provided by an
additional CCH check back midway through the Service Chan-
nel interval. Mathematical analysis and experimentation using
simulations have shown that this method results in signiﬁcant
latency reduction. The maximum transmission delay for safety-
critical messages can be reduced by approximately half whilst
only reducing the Service Channel capacity by one quarter. As the
work progresses, we will optimise the duration of the check back
to ﬁnd the best compromise between safety and infotainment.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the interest in Vehicular Ad Hoc Net-
works (VANETs) has increased considerably, particularly to
improve the safety and efﬁciency of transportation networks
through wireless communications. VANETs comprise vehicles
equipped with transceivers capable of exchanging information
either Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I). While V2I communication requires huge infrastructure
investment, V2V communication is more viable. The Wireless
Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) standardised com-
munication technology has been recently designed speciﬁcally
for VANETs. WAVE includes the 1609 protocol family, as
well as the IEEE 802.11p standard, a redesigned version of
IEEE 802.11 that reduces the use of control packets and
authentication in order to ensure swift delivery of data [1]. The
1609.4 protocol sits on top of 802.11p and allows for multi-
channel communication over a single radio. Infotainment and
safety applications can then coexist as the 1609.4 protocol [2]
alternates periodically between a Control Channel (CCH) and
one of six Service Channels (SCHs).
Infotainment applications in VANETs are aimed at enhanc-
ing the driving experience by providing non-safety applica-
tions, such as entertainment services [3]. Such services are
transmitted as infotainment messages over one of the SCHs.
Safety applications, on the other hand, are aimed at assist-
ing drivers with real-time information about road and trafﬁc
conditions in order to reduce the number of accidents caused
by human error. These applications are transmitted as safety-
critical messages over the CCH. Examples of safety-critical
applications are Cooperative Collision Warning (CCW), Elec-
tronic Emergency Brake Light (EEBL) and Slow/Stopped
Vehicle Alert (SVA). Low latency communication is essential
for these applications to be effective.
In this work in progress, we are particularly interested in
improving dissemination of safety-critical messages while al-
lowing the coexistence of infotainment applications. A number
of solutions to this problem have already been proposed.
Ghandour et al. [4] propose an enhancement in which the
SCHs are made available for safety-critical messages, with
nodes informing their neighbours of which SCH they intend
to use for safety-critical transmissions. They also propose a
second enhancement with the aim of mitigating the issue of
synchronous collisions that can occur between transmitted
safety-critical messages. This involves measuring the level
of contention at the start of the safety-critical transmission
interval and increasing the probability of transmissions being
deferred if contention levels are high, spreading safety-critical
transmissions out more evenly to reduce collisions.
Mak et al. [5] attempt to ﬁnd a balance between safety-
critical and infotainment transmissions by assuming safety
only communications between vehicles by default while adopt-
ing a roadside access point to handle the coordination of
infotainment services.
Jiang et al. [6] propose a number of alterations to 1609.4,
including an ECHO protocol in which nodes receiving safety-
critical messages rebroadcast them if they have not heard
them recently. This improves the probability of reception due
to multiple transmissions of the same safety-critical mes-
sage, a useful enhancement for a protocol that operates in
a dynamic environment in which packets can easily be lost.
Their paper also outlines a Piggybacked Acknowledgement
(PACK) protocol, which ’piggybacks’ acknowledgements on
safety messages to allow safety-critical broadcasters to get
feedback on the performance of their safety-critical broadcasts
and retransmit their safety-critical message if the failure rate
is too high.
Our work in progress involves a simple solution that in-
creases the time in which vehicles access the CCH for trans-
mission of safety-critical messages. This solution preserves the
overall time structure of the multi-channel communication in
the 1609.4 protocol, while reducing latency.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section
II brieﬂy reviews the time division in the 1609.4 protocol
and provides a mathematical analysis of transmission delay.

Section III details our proposed solution. Experimental results
over a simulated VANET using NS-2 are presented in Section
IV. Conclusions are presented in Section VI.
II. THE 1609.4 PROTOCOL
In the 1609.4 protocol, vehicles switch frequencies between
the CCH and one of six different SCHs, while maintaining
synchronisation with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
via Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. The time period
in which vehicles are tuned to the CCH and then one of the
SCHs is called the SYNC interval, which lasts 100 ms. More
speciﬁcally, each SYNC interval comprises a CCH interval,
which lasts 46 ms, followed by a SCH interval, which also
lasts 46 ms. There is a 4 ms guard period before switching to
the CCH and the SCH interval. This is illustrated in Figure 1.
The SYNC interval repeats indeﬁnitely.
Under the existing 1609.4 protocol, vehicles spend as
much time on the SCHs as they do on the CCH. Given
the importance of safety applications, we argue that safety-
critical messages should be given a higher priority and greater
access to the medium than infotainment messages, which are
currently given equal access within each cycle. This is a very
reasonable assumption considering the recent advancements
in 4G/LTE that permit very high data rates and could be used
for transferring large ﬁles that do not have signiﬁcant latency
requirements.
Figure 1. The SYNC interval in the 1609.4 protocol.
A. Transmission delay of safety-critical messages
We can perform mathematical analysis on this protocol
under the assumption that the time at which a packet is
sent within the SYNC interval is chosen randomly from a
uniform distribution U(0ms, 100ms). This is realistic because
in a real world scenario there is no reason that an emergency
event should fall within a speciﬁc interval. Additionally, this
analysis assumes that the channel is clear upon transmission,
and the packet, if sent at any point within the CCH interval, is
received successfully. Under these assumptions, the expected
delay E[Delay] to receive a safety message sent on the channel
may be calculated as follows:
E[Delay] = δ +
4
X
i=1

durationi
durationtotal
× CCH Delayi

(1)
where δ represents the average propagation delay for a packet
sent using Nakagami Propagation [7], CCH Delayi represents
the average time between interval i and the next CCH interval.
Note that (1) assumes four intervals, the CCH and SCH
intervals plus two guard periods. Should a packet be sent
within the CCH, the expected delay is simply δ.
Using (1) and the channel durations shown in Figure 1 we
can calculate the expected latency for a packet within the
1609.4 protocol. The results of this are shown in Table I.

As shown in Table I, the expected delay for a safety-
critical message sent under the assumptions listed previously
is 0.01673 seconds.
III. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION
Currently, the main issue with the SYNC interval in the the
1609.4 protocol is the disproportionate amount of time spent
by vehicles on one of the SCHs, which prevents detection
of any safety-critical messages. Our proposed solution is
therefore to introduce an additional CCH interval within the
SCH interval to reduce the latency of safety-critical message
delivery. In other words, vehicles now tune back to the
CCH during the SCH to transmit/receive pending safety-
critical messages. This second CCH interval, referred to as
CCH CHECK, occurs halfway through the SCH interval such
that each newly created half of the SCH interval, referred to
as SCH 1 and SCH 2 respectively, are of equal length. A 4ms
guard period still exists before intervals. This is illustrated in
Figure 2.
The CCH CHECK is k ms long. The beneﬁts gained by
using different values of k are being investigated through
ongoing research, with initial forays investigating the beneﬁts
of k = 4 ms. This initial value has been chosen as it
allows sufﬁcient time to send safety-critical messages without
signiﬁcantly impeding on the SCH duration.
Under this initial proposal, the CCH CHECK is to be
treated as a normal CCH interval for safety-critical messages,
but is not used for low priority safety-critical messages. Should
all nodes successfully transmit all queued safety-critical mes-
sages, they will wait until the full k ms have elapsed before
returning to the SCH via a GUARD period. An alternative
method is discussed in Section V.

Our proposed solution preserves the overall timing structure
of the 1609.4 protocol, with a 100 ms SYNC duration split
evenly between the CCH interval and the SCH interval. The
SCH interval, however, now comprises a short CCH interval.
The length of each SCH interval is half the remaining time
period as shown in (2). The proposed intervals are summarised
in Table II.

In the current 1609.4 protocol, when a safety-critical mes-
sage is generated outside of the CCH interval, it is queued and
sent in the following CCH interval. The worst-case scenario is
when a safety-critical message is generated at the end of the
current CCH interval and the time to transmit that message
is longer than the time left in the CCH interval. In this case,
the message is queued and scheduled for transmission at the
beginning of the following CCH interval, which can cause a
wait of 54 ms. In the proposed solution, there is at most a
27 − k
2 delay; with k = 4 ms, this represents only a 25 ms
delay, which is less than half the original delay.
It is important to note that at the beginning of a CCH
interval in the existing 1609.4 protocol, there may be a high
risk of packet collision because vehicles attempt to transmit
all the safety-critical messages queued up since the last CCH
interval, which may have accumulated over as long as 54 ms.
The proposed solution reduces this to 27− k
2. An open question
that requires investigation is how long k should be in order to
successfully transmit all the safety-critical messages generated
in previous SCH intervals, including the guard periods.
The proposed solution inevitably has a detrimental effect
on the transmission of infotainment messages. However, this
detrimental effect is expected to be minimal in comparison
to the positive effects on the dissemination of safety-critical
messages, which is arguably the most important aspect of
WAVE, particularly during emergency events.
A. Expected transmission delay of safety-critical messages
Using the same assumptions and calculations as those used
in Section II-A, Table III provides a mathematical analysis
of the expected delay of a packet which is sent using the
proposed solution to neighbours within broadcast range of
the transmitting node, with a value k = 4 ms. Note that the
expected latency is 8.4 ms, which represents an improvement
of
0.0084
0.01673 ≈ 50%. The minimum expected delay reduction is
therefore 0.01673s − 0.0084s = 0.00833s.

The proposed reduction on the SCH interval reduces the
amount of time available for transmission of infotainment
messages. Our proposed solution reduces the SCH interval
from 46 ms to 2 × (19 − k
2) = 34ms, when k = 4 ms, which
represents a SCH capacity reduction of 46−34
46
≈ 26%
Using the same method as shown in Table III after some
simpliﬁcation, (3) shows the expected delay with an arbitrary

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
NS-2 [8] was used to simulate the 1609.4 protocol with
the proposed solution with a value of k = 4 ms for the
CCH CHECK interval.
The simulations were ran 2,000 times with each simula-
tion lasting 100 seconds. Within each run, one safety-critical
message was sent. This is to represent one emergency event
occurring in each run. The time the packet is sent is determined
by the same uniform random distribution as used in the
mathematical analysis in Sections III-A and II-A. A total
of 100 simulated vehicles were spread across a 1 km road
with 4 lanes. Each vehicle was randomly located within the
road and in this initial simulation, vehicles were static. The
Nakagami Propagation model was used for all simulations
with a minimum transmission range of 250 m and an event
horizon of 1km. Other parameters in 802.11p were set to their
default values. When nodes receive a safety-critical message,
their distance from the initial transmitting node and the time
difference between transmission and reception of the message
is recorded within a database. This is later used for analysis.
Since generating the data used in this document, several mo-
bility traces using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)
[9] tool have been generated that will enable the simulation
of more realistic roads and vehicle movements. SUMO is
an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous
road trafﬁc simulation package designed to handle large road
networks. Also, added is the ability to send arbitrarily large
numbers of messages within the simulation, which is to be
used in later simulations.
Table IV tabulates the average delay for a single safety-
critical message for different distances. Note that for those

nodes within the broadcast range (0-250m), the improvement
is between 8.4 − 8.8 ms. This is very close to, but slightly
higher than, the predicted value of 8.33 ms, as computed
in Section III-A. When nodes are signiﬁcantly outside the
broadcast range, multi-hop transmissions pass the message
onto all nodes until the event horizon is reached. The event
horizon ensures packets are not forwarded indeﬁnitely.

An important metric to analyse is the latency incurred when
safety-critical messages are generated at the very end of the
CCH interval, i.e., generated at 46ms into the cycle, which
represents a worst-case scenario. Let us recall that under the
1609.4 protocol, these messages would be queued to be sent
in the next CCH interval. In the proposed solution, these
messages can now be sent within the CCH CHECK interval.
Table V shows the improvement attained by our proposal for
nodes within the broadcast range of the transmitting node.

As can be seen in Table V, the reduction in latency in this
worst case scenario is over 52%, a signiﬁcant reduction.
V. FURTHER RESEARCH
Our work will next explore the advantages gained by the
modiﬁcation of the k value. We intend to focus on the range
k = {2..16} ms to ensure that sufﬁcient time is available
for the SCH interval. Additionally we will investigate beneﬁts
gained by immediately returning back to the SCH if there are
no messages to be sent during the CCH CHECK. An example
case we may investigate is that if no messages are sent within
the ﬁrst k
2 milliseconds then those inactive nodes can re-tune
to the SCH and continue offering infotainment services. An
additional point of investigation is how our modiﬁed protocol
handles heavy busy environments, with particular interest in
how effectively collisions are handled.
We would like to examine the effects of our protocol on a
real-world WAVE application such as EEBL, comparing the
existing 1609.4 protocol with our proposed solution in an ap-
propriate SUMO simulation. We will compare the performance
of our solution with similar solutions proposed by others.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented our work in progress on enhanced dis-
semination of safety-critical messages in the 1609.4 protocol
for VANETs. Speciﬁcally, we presented the idea of introducing
CCH interval within each SCH interval. Our initial results
are greatly encouraging and appear to satisfy our objective,
which is to attain a signiﬁcant reduction in safety-critical
message latency with minimal reduction in SCH duration.
We are continuing to investigate the beneﬁts generated by the
introduction of this short CCH interval and explore alternative
modiﬁcations. As part of our future work, we are interested in
ﬁnding the best trade-off between the enhancement of safety-
critical message dissemination and the reduction in service
channel capacity.
