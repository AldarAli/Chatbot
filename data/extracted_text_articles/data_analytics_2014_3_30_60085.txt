Abstract—Comparing the simulation output with reference 
output is an important measure to validate a simulation model. 
The classic methods either analyze the data consistency of 
simulation output and reference output or the consistency of 
their features. Considering the two types of consistencies 
simultaneously, a validation method of simulation model based 
on combined consistency analysis of data and feature is 
proposed. The measurement model of data consistency 
integrating the proximity of spatial position and similarity of 
geometrical shape is presented, and the measurement model of 
feature consistency based on relative error is given. Besides, 
the weight of each consistency index was determined by 
analyzing the correlation among the consistency indexes, and 
the consistency integration model is given. Finally, the 
validation method is applied to validate a simulation model of 
servo-control system.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Simulation has been widely used in many fields, such as 
military, economic and social areas, with the advantages of 
economy, security and efficiency. Because simulation is a 
scientific research based on models, the credibility of model 
attracts much attention. The simulation model validation is 
the primary means to research the credibility of model, and 
the consistency analysis of simulation output and the 
reference output is an important method for simulation 
model validation [1][2]. 
As early as 1962, Biggs made an assessment for the 
credibility of the "dogs" missile model [3]. Fishman and 
Kiviat used spectral analysis to assess the credibility of the 
queuing model [4]. Hermann made a consistency validation 
between the real system and simulation model, based on the 
intrinsic features or typical events [5]. Mckenny proposed 
some methods based on the analysis of variance, 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and 
χ2
 test [6]. Kheir and 
Holmes utilized Theil inequality coefficient (TIC) method to 
validate the effectiveness of a missile simulation system [7]. 
Through the analysis of features of grey correlation model, 
Wei and Li made an application to assess the credibility of a 
missile simulation system [8]. Damborg assessed the 
credibility of econometric models with the error analysis 
methods [9]. Liu, Liu and Zhang discussed the relation 
between credibility and similarity, and gave a quantitative 
method of simulation model credibility according to the 
similarity [10]. Moreover, Balci, Sargent and Kleijnen gave 
some summaries to the validation of simulation model 
[11][12][13]. 
The analysis of classical methods above shows that, there 
are mainly two research ideas, namely, 1) the features we 
concerned were extracted from the output data of simulation 
and reference, such as the rise time, overshoot and steady-
state error in controlling response. Then, feature consistency 
can be analyzed via variance analysis and hypothesis test, 
etc., and 2) the data consistency of simulation output and 
reference output was analyzed directly, such as TIC method 
and gray correlation method, etc. The data consistency of 
simulation output and reference output reflects their 
panoramic consistency, but ignores the consistencies of some 
detailed features easily. For some simulation applications, 
the data consistency and feature consistency are focused on. 
So, the two types of consistencies should be considered 
simultaneously in the validation of simulation model. 
To solve the above problem in terms of continuous 
dynamic simulation of multi-output, this paper presents a 
new method of simulation model validation, considering 
multiply features. The advantages of this new method are 
more comprehensive, convincing and reliable. The paper is 
organized as follows: In Section 2, the research problems 
will be described and analyzed. In Section 3, the 
measurement models of data consistency and feature 
consistency will be given. In Section 4, the integrated model 
of consistency will be given. In Section 5, the effectiveness 
of this method will be shown through application examples. 
In the last Section, summary is drawn and future research is 
discussed.

method proposed in this paper has two difficulties: 1) how to 
measure the data consistency and feature consistency; 2) 
how to deal with the correlation among the consistencies of 
data and features and integrate them to gain the consistencies 
of simulation output.

CONSISTENCY MEASUREMENT MODEL

model are presented.

respectively. 
The 
data 
consistency can be obtained by considering the "proximity" 
of position and the "similarity" of shape comprehensively. 
The simulation model is validated by the difference of 
position between 
ry  and 
sy , which is depicted by the 
coefficient of TIC in [7]. The formula is as follows:

B. Feature consistency measurement model 
Some features extracted from the reference output and 
the simulation output, are denoted by 
rc  and

The relative error is used to describe the difference between 
them, as shown in (13) [14]. The degree of consistency is 
obtained by mapping the relative error to interval (0,1]  
through negative exponential function, as shown in (14) [15].

APPLICATION 
The object of application studied in this paper is a model 
of servo-control system. The reference output is the step 
response of the actual system; the simulation output is 30 
times the running output of the simulation model, as shown 
in Fig. 3(a). There are two ways to validate the credibility of 
simulation model using the classical methods: 1) Analyze the 
consistency of step response between the actual system and 
simulation model directly; 2) Extract rise time, overshoot 
and steady-state error from step response of the actual 
system and simulation model respectively, then analyze the 
features consistency between them. However, no matter 
which way is used above, the consistency between the 
simulation output and the reference output is portrayed from 
one-sided. In addition, the correlation between multiple data 
consistency and features consistency was not considered by 
the classic methods.

For the problems above, this paper not only considers the 
data consistency of step response, but also considers the 
consistency of rise time, overshoot and steady-state error. By 
analyzing the correlation between them, the respective 
weights are determined. The consistency analysis results 
based on (7) to (13) are shown in Table 1, where

The analysis result shows that compared to the 
consistency of the reference output in the instance, the 
consistency of the simulation output consistency is better. It 
indicates that the simulation model is credible. By observing 
the simulation output and the reference output from Fig. 3(a) 
to 3(d), it can be concluded that they have good consistency. 
The results of this paper are identical with this conclusion. 
Thus, the effectiveness of the method in this paper is verified. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper focused on the study of the validation of 
simulation model. Our goal is to obtain the consistency 
degree of simulation output and reference output by 
considering the data consistency and feature consistency 
simultaneously. In this paper, three conclusions are obtained 
as follows: 1) The new research thought of simulation model 
validation was given. 2) The measurement model of data 
consistency integrating the "proximity" of position and 
"similarity" of shape and the measurement model of feature 
consistency based on relative error are presented. 3) The 
method of how to integrate two types of consistency 
measurement model was proposed. However, the scarcity of 
the reference output may exist in multi-output dynamic 
simulation. So, in future research, it is planned to concentrate 
on how to integrate with the expert knowledge to validate 
simulation model.
