Abstract— WordNet has been used widely in natural language 
processing and semantic applications. Despite the reputation of 
WordNet, the polysemy problem that leads to insufficient 
quality of applications results is still unsolved. Many 
approaches have been suggested. However, none of them give a 
comprehensive solution to the problem. In this paper, we 
introduce a pattern based approach that solves the polysemy 
problem in the case of nouns. To achieve this result we 
introduce a set of novel relations that represent polysemy types 
and a set of new operations that allow us to organize the 
specialization polysemy cases.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Polysemy in WordNet [1][9] is considered to be the main 
reason that makes it hard to use for natural language 
processing (NLP) and semantic applications [12][17]. 
Differentiating between the types of polysemy should be 
possible through explicit semantic relations between the 
senses of polysemous terms. Unfortunately, relations 
between polysemous terms are not provided in WordNet [2]. 
For instance, WordNet does not provide the distinction 
between homographs, and  complementary terms [6]. 
In the last, decades many approaches have been 
introduced to solve the polysemy problem through merging 
the similar meanings of polysemous terms [4]. These 
approaches  are sometimes helpful in cases, where terms 
have meanings that are similar enough to be merged. 
However, polysemous terms with similar meanings are a 
sub-case of the solution of specialization polysemy [14]. 
They represent only a small portion of the polysemy 
problem.  In fact, a significant portion of the polysemous 
senses should not be merged, as they are just similar in 
meaning [5] and not redundant. In another approach, 
CORELEX [6] has been introduced as an ontology of 
systematic polysemous nouns extracted from WordNet. 
However, CORELEX deals only with the upper level 
ontology of WordNet that corresponds mainly to the 
metonymy cases and does not provide a solution for other 
polysemy types [16]. 
In this paper, we introduce a pattern based approach that 
combines several ideas to solve the polysemy problem. Our 
approach follows the idea that the polysemy problem is a 
problem of semantic organization [3]. Thus, the goal of our 
approach is to reorganize the semantic structure of the 
polysemous terms in wordNet, where we transform the 
implicit relations between the polysemous terms at lexical 
level to explicit relations at the semantic level. This includes  
extending WordNet by adding new hierarchical and 
associative relations between the synsets to explicitly denote 
the polysemy type occurring between the meanings of each 
polysemous term, as suggested in [2]. To achieve this goal, 
our approach deals with all polysemy types at all ontological 
levels of WordNet. It deals with the lower level ontology of 
WordNet and it extends the merge operation suggested by 
the polysemy reduction approaches [4][15] by providing new 
operations that organize the relations between the meanings 
of polysemous terms. Our approach also deals with 
polysemy in the middle level, as it is the case in regular 
polysemy approaches [14] and also in the upper level 
ontology as in systematic polysemy approaches [6].   
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we 
describe the polysemy problem in WordNet. In Section III, 
we describe the current approaches for solving the polysemy 
problem in WordNet. In Section IV, we present the semantic 
relations that denote polysemy types and the operations that 
reorganize the structure of polysemous terms in WordNet. 
In Section V, we introduce a pattern based approach for 
solving the polysemy problem in the case of polysemous 
nouns. In Section VI, we discuss the results and evaluation 
of our approach. In Section VII, we conclude the paper and 
describe our future research work.  
II. POLYSEMY IN WORDNET 
WordNet is a lexical database that organizes synonyms of 
English words into sets called synsets, where each synset is 
described through a gloss. For example, the words 
happiness and felicity are considered to be synonyms and 
grouped into one synset {happiness, felicity} that is 
described 
through 
the 
gloss: 
state 
of 
well-being 
characterized by emotions ranging from contentment to 
intense joy.  
 WordNet organizes the relations between synsets 
through semantic relations, where each word category has a 
number of relations that are used to organize the relations 
between the synsets of that grammatical category. For 
example, the hyponymy relation (X is a type of Y) is used to 
63

organize the ontological structure of nouns. WordNet 2.1 
contains 147,257 words, 117,597 synsets and 207,019 word-
sense pairs. Among these words there are 27,006 
polysemous words, where 15776 of them are nouns.  
From linguistics, a term is polysemous if it has more than 
one 
meaning 
[17]. 
Linguists 
differentiate 
between 
contrastive polysemy, i.e. terms with completely different 
and unrelated meanings - also called homonyms or 
homographs; and complementary polysemy, i.e. terms with 
different but related meanings. Complementary polysemy is 
classified in three sub types: Metonymy, specialization 
polysemy and metaphors. Following the above, we can 
classify the various forms of polysemy as follows: 
1) Complementary polysemy: terms that have the same 
spelling 
and 
related 
meanings. 
Complementary 
polysemy can be: 
a. 
Metonymy: substituting the name of an 
attribute or feature for the name of the thing 
itself, such as in the following example: 
Peter caught a chicken in his garden. 
Peter prepared chicken for the dinner. 
b. Specialization polysemy: a term is used to 
refer to a more general meaning and another 
more specific meaning, such as in the 
following example the term methodology: 
1. methodology, methodological analysis: 
the branch of philosophy. 
2. methodology: the system of methods 
followed in a particular discipline. 
c. 
Metaphors: terms that have the same spelling  
and have literal and figurative meanings. Consider, 
for instance, the term parasite:  
1. parasite: an animal or plant that lives in or on a 
host (another animal or plant). 
2. leech, parasite, sponge, sponger: a follower who 
hangs around a host (without benefit to the host) in 
hope of gain or advantage. 
2) Homographs: terms that have the same spelling and 
different unrelated meanings, such as  the term bank:  
Peter sat on the bank of the river. 
Peter deposited money in the bank. 
 
In WordNet, the number of senses a polysemous 
term may range from 2 senses to more than 30 senses. In 
some rare cases may more; for instance, the noun head has 
33 senses.  
Nevertheless, 90% of the polysemous nouns have 
less than 5 senses. Table I shows the distribution of these 
polysemous nouns according to the number of senses they 
have. Notice that, in this paper, we are concerned with 
polysemous nouns only and not the verbs, adverbs and 
adjectives.  
The fact that a term has more than two senses implies that 
the meanings of the term belong to more than one type of 
polysemy.  For example, the term food has 3 senses as 
mentioned below, where the polysemy type between the 
first and the second meanings is specialization polysemy, 
while the third meaning is metaphoric.

    source of nourishment. 
   3. food, food for thought: anything that provides mental  
stimulus for thinking. 
III. 
APPROACHES FOR SOLVING POLYSEMY IN WORDNET 
The approaches of polysemy can be classified in two 
main approaches. The first is polysemy reduction, where the 
focus is on complementary polysemy to produce more 
coarse-grained lexical resources of existing fine-grained 
ones such as WordNet. The second type of polysemy 
approaches focuses on classifying polysemy into systematic 
or regular polysemy and homographs. Based on this 
classification, CORELEX  was introduced as ontology of 
systematic polysemous nouns extracted from WordNet. 
Other approaches, such as in [13][14], were introduced to 
extract semantic relations between regular polysemous 
terms in WordNet.     
In the following, we summarize Polysemy reduction 
approaches and CORELEX, the most famous systematic 
polysemy approaches. Notice that neither polysemy 
reduction approaches nor CORELEX could solve the 
polysemy problem in WordNet. In general, Polysemy 
reduction approaches could not solve the problem of the 
upper level ontology where CORELEX did not provide a 
solution for polysemy in the middle and lower level 
ontology of WordNet. 
A. Polysemy Reduction Approaches 
In polysemy reduction, the senses are clustered such that 
each group contains related polysemous words [18][15]. 
These groups are called homograph clusters. Once the 
clusters have been identified, the senses in each cluster are 
merged. To achieve this task, several strategies have been 
introduced. These strategies can be mainly categorized in 
semantic-based and statistics-based strategies [17]. Some 
approaches combine both strategies [15]. Although results 
of applications of these approaches are reported, these 
results are taken usually from applying them on sample data 
sets and there is no way to verify these results 
independently.  Polysemy reduction approaches typically 
rely on the application of some detection rules such as: If S1 
64

eKNOW 2013 : The Fifth International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

and S2 are two synsets containing at least two words, and if 
S1 and S2 contain the same words, then S1 and S2 can be 
collapsed together into one single synset [10]. However, 
applying this rule may wrongly result in merging two 
different senses as in the following example: 
1. smoke, smoking: a hot vapor containing fine particles 
of carbon being produced by combustion. 
2. smoke, smoking: the act of smoking tobacco or other 
substances.   
In general, polysemy reduction can neither predict the 
polysemy type occurring between the senses of polysemous 
words nor can deal with metonymy or metaphors. Polysemy 
reduction does not solve the polysemy problem in linguistic 
resource. Nevertheless, it can be potentially used to solve 
part of the problem, namely the identification and merging 
of genuine redundant synsets. 
B. Regular Polysemy Approaches 
J. Apresjan defined regular polysemy as follows: “A 
polysemous Term T is considered to be regular if there 
exists at least another polysemous T’ that is semantically 
distinguished in the same way as T” [8].  Systematic 
polysemy approaches rely on this definition. CORELEX, 
the first systematic polysemy lexical database, follows the 
generative lexicon theory [3] that distinguishes between 
systematic (also known as regular or logic) polysemy and 
homographs. Systematic polysemous words are systematic 
and predictable while homonyms are not regular and not 
predictable. The type of polysemy of the word fish for 
example is systematic since the meaning food can be 
predicted from the animal meaning and so the word fish 
belongs to the systematic class animal food. The two 
meanings of fish describe two related aspects of fish: fish is 
an animal and fish is a food. That a word is systematic 
polysemous means that the meanings of this word are not 
homonyms and they describe different aspects of the same 
term.  Following this distinction, CORELEX organizes the 
polysemous nouns of WordNet 1.5 into 126 systematic 
polysemy classes. The systematic polysemy classes in 
CORELEX have been determined in a top down fashion 
considering the patterns in the upper level ontology of 
wordNet only. It does not consider the metaphoric cases. 
Also, there is no cleaning process carried out on WordNet 
by CORELEX construction. Another important point is 
related to the fine grained nature of WordNet where the 
meanings of some CORELEX classes are very difficult to 
disambiguate and indistinguishable even for humans [11]. 
IV. 
DENOTING POLYSEMY TYPES AND ORGANIZING 
POLYSEMY IN WORDNET 
Making WordNet a more coarse grained lexical resource 
does not solve the polysemy problem, although there are 
some fine grained  polysemous cases in WordNet. We 
believe that the polysemy problem in WordNet is primarily 
a problem of organizing  the senses of polysemous terms.  
In the cases of homographs, metonymy, and metaphors, we 
need semantic relations that denote the polysemy type of 
corresponding cases. The cases of specialization polysemy 
on the other hand require reorganizing the semantic 
structure to reflect the (implicit) hierarchical relation 
between such senses. In the following, we introduce the 
relations to denote homographs, metonymy, and metaphors 
and then we present the operations for solving specialization 
polysemy cases.  
A. Polysemy Type Relations 
In the following, we explain the suggested relations to 
denote the polysemy types: 
Homographs: There is no relation between the senses of a 
homograph term. Nevertheless, differentiating homographs 
from other polysemy types is very important improvement 
in wordNet. We use the relation is_homograph to denote 
that two synsets of a polysemous term are homographs. For 
example, this relation holds between the synsets {saki as 
alcoholic drink} and {saki as a monkey}.   
Metonymy: In metonymy cases, there is always a base 
meaning of the term and other derived  meanings that 
express different aspects of the base meaning [19]. For 
example, the term chicken has the base meaning {a 
domestic fowl bred for flesh or eggs} and a derived meaning 
{the flesh of a chicken used for food}. To denote the relation 
between the senses of a metonymy term, we use the relation 
has_aspect, where this relation holds between the base 
meaning of a term and the derived meanings of that term. 
To set up the relation we need to determine the base 
meaning and then relate the other derived meanings to it.  
Metaphors: In metaphoric cases, we use the relation 
Is_metaphor to denote the metaphoric relation between the 
metaphoric meaning and literal meaning of a metaphoric 
term. For example this relation is used to denote that {cool 
as great coolness and composure under strain} is 
metaphoric meaning of the literal meaning {cool as the 
quality of being at a refreshingly low temperature}. In the 
cases, where this relation is applicable, we need to specify 
the literal meaning and the metaphoric meaning. 
B. Operations for Specialization polysemy 
    Analysis of specialization polysemy cases shows that 
such cases can be classified based on the synset synonyms 
into the following three groups. To explain our idea, we 
have chosen cases, where the synsets of each term share the 
same common parent.  
Let T be a polysemous term that occurs in two synsets S1 
and S2.  We consider T in the following three cases: 
Case 1: T has synonyms in S1 and has synonyms in S2 as in 
the case of kestrel: 
1. kestrel, falco sparverius: small American falcon. 
2. kestrel, Falco tinnunculus: small Old World falcon.  
Case 2:  T has synonyms in S1 or in S2 but not in both as in 
the case of dorsum: 
1. back, dorsum: the posterior part of a human (or 
animal) body from the neck to the end of the spine. 
65

eKNOW 2013 : The Fifth International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

2. dorsum: the back of the body of a vertebrate or any 
analogous surface. 
Case 3: T has no synonyms in S1 or S2 as the in the case of 
compatible software: 
1. compatible software: application software programs 
that share common conventions. 
2. compatible software: software that can run on 
different computers without modification. 
 
In case 1, T has synonyms in S1 which means 
that T is exchangeable with the other synonyms of S1 and at 
the same time is also exchangeable with the synonyms of 
S2. Let T1, T2 be non polysemous synonyms of T in S1 and 
S2 respectively. T1 is synonymous with T but not with T2. 
Otherwise T1 and T2 should appear in the same synset. The 
fact that T1 and T2 appear in two different sibling synsets 
indicates that they are not the same. We think that the 
semantic relatedness between S1 and S2 is encoded at 
lexical level rather than semantic level.  We have the same 
observation in case 2. The fact that one synset contains T 
only and the other synset contains additional terms indicates 
that the synset that contains T only is a more general 
meaning of the synset that have additional terms. We 
consider the terms in case 3 as candidates to be merged. 
Accordingly, we suggest the following operations to 
organize the relations between the senses in specialization 
polysemy cases: 
Solution for Case 1: We add  a new (missing) parent in 
cases, where the polysemous meanings of a term T can be 
seen more specific meanings of an absent more general 
meaning. In such cases, we create the new missing more 
general meaning and connect the more specific meanings to 
the new created new parent.  This operation is schematized 
in the figure 1.

Solution for Case 2: In such cases, we establish a new  
(missing) is_a relation to denote that a sense of a 
polysemous term T is more specific than another  more 
general meaning of T.  We schematize this operation as 
illustrated in figure 2. 
Solution for case 3:  In such cases, we merge the meanings. 
The merge operation is schematized as in figure 3. 
    At the term level, we disambiguate the polysemous terms 
as follows: in case (1)  We remove the polysemous terms 
from both child synsets and  keep the polysemous words in 
the new added parent synset only. In case (2) We remove 
the polysemous term from the synset with the more specific

meaning. The Merge operation in case 3 unifies the terms of 
both synsets in one synset. Thus, applying the three 
operations results in reducing the number of polysemous 
words in WordNet. 
V. 
PATTERN BASED APPROACH FOR SOLVING POLYSEMY 
In this section, we describe our approach for solving 
polysemy in WordNet. The approach has the following four 
phases. The first and the third phases are automatic, while 
the second and fourth are manual:

D.  Validation

A. Patterns Identification 
We apply a pattern extraction algorithm that computes 
the regular patterns for the polysemous terms. The algorithm 
returns the following lists:  
1. a list of regular patterns: contains the regular patterns, 
where at least two terms belong to each pattern.  
2. a list of sub patterns: contains the sub patterns of the 
patterns identified in the regular  patterns list.    
3. a list of common parent terms: contains the terms, where 
the synsets or part of the synsets of these terms share the 
same hypernym.  
4. a list of singleton patterns: This list contains the patterns 
that have less than two terms and are not sub patterns of any 
regular pattern.   
    Notice that it is possible for terms that have more than 2 
senses to have more than one pattern. In the following, we 
illustrate the definitions, we used in our algorithm. 
Definition 1:  Regular Structural Pattern  Let T  be a 
polysemous term that has n meanings, n > 1. Let S  be the 
set of the synsets of T . Let R be a subset of S. Let Q  an 
ordered sequence of R,  where

. A pattern is 
regular  if there are at least two terms that belong to it. For 
example, the pattern passerine#<oscine, tyrannid> is 
regular since there are 3 terms that belong to it. 
Definition 2: Sub pattern For a  regular pattern ptrn =

    Sub patterns are important, since it is possible that the 
elements of a pattern and its sub patterns have the same 
polysemy type. For example, the pattern passerine#<oscine, 
tyrannid> and its sub pattern  passerine#<oscine,wren> 
belong both to the specialization polysemy patterns. 
Definition 3: Common parent class A term belongs to the 
common parent class if it has at least  two synsets that share 
the same hypernym. For example, the synsets of the term 
kestrel in the previous section share the same hypernym. In 
polysemy reduction approaches, senses that have the 
common parent property are candidates to be merged. In our 
approach, such terms are candidates for specialization 
polysemy.  Note that there are many terms that have this 
property, but they are not considered to be regular according 
to definition 1 since they have different hierarchical 
structures.  
B. Patterns Classification 
In this phase, we manually classify the patterns gained in 
the previous phase, where we assign each pattern the 
polysemy type, the terms of the pattern belong to. We 
classify the patterns into the following  groups: 
1. Specialization polysemy patterns 
2. Metaphoric patterns 
3. Metonymy patterns   
4. Homonymy patterns   
5. Singleton and mixed patterns 
The singleton and mixed patterns group contains the 
singleton patterns and the patterns that contain patterns 
whose terms may belong to more than one polysemy type. 
For 
example, 
there 
are 
terms 
under 
the 
pattern 
attribute#<quality, trait> that belong metaphoric polysemy 
and others that belong to specialization polysemy. In the 
following, we describe our analysis in this phase according 
to the pattern position in the ontology of WordNet: 
Top level patterns: the patterns at the top level ontology 
correspond to metonymy and metaphoric terms. It is 
unlikely to find specialization polysemy terms at the top 
level patterns. Although homonyms is not regular and, it is 
also possible to determine some homonymy patterns at the 
top 
level 
ontology. 
For 
example, 
the 
pattern  
organism#<animal, plant> is considered as homograph 
pattern, since we exclude the possibility of specialization 
polysemy, metonymy and metaphoric in the terms that 
belong to that pattern. 
 Middle level patterns:  the patterns here correspond 
mainly to specialization polysemy and metaphoric cases. It 
is possible also to find homograph patterns at this level. To  
differentiate between specialization polysemy and other 
polysemy types, we use the following criteria: 
• 
Specialization polysemy/ metaphors: 
specialization polysemy patterns indicate consistency 
between the pattern parts, while metaphoric patterns 
indicate meaning transfer from their literal meaning to a 
(metaphoric) meaning. For example,  oscine and 
tyrannid are consistent since they belong to the type 
passerine in the pattern passerine#<oscine, tyrannid>, 
while we find meaning transfer from property {a basic 
or essential attribute shared by all members of a class} 
to trait {a distinguishing feature of your personal 
nature} in the pattern attribute#<property, trait> .   
• 
Specialization polysemy/ homographs:  
In contrary to specialization polysemy, homograph 
patterns indicate inconsistency. For example, person is 
inconsistent with plant and the metaphoric link is 
excluded in the pattern organism#<person ,plant>. 
Lower level patterns: the patterns at the lower level 
ontology are those patterns that belong to common parent 
class and they correspond mainly to specialization 
polysemy. It is possible to find metaphors and/or 
homographs at the lower level ontology. Such cases are 
determined and excluded in the validation phase.   
C. Polysemy type Assignment 
In this phase,  the terms are assigned to the polysemy 
type of the pattern they belong to. The terms that belong 
singleton and mixed patterns are not assigned and they are 
subject to manual treatment in the validation phase.

D. Validation 
In this phase, we manually validate the assigned 
polysemy type.  This phase includes three tasks: 
1. Validation of the assigned polysemy types: we check 
whether each of the nouns belong to its assigned 
polysemy type.  
2. Assigning the polysemy type: for the terms that belong 
to the singleton and mixed  patterns. 
3. Excluding of false positives:  we exclude the false 
positives from the terms of the automatic assigned 
groups.  Our judgments during the validation are based 
on knowledge organization. Word etymology and 
linguistic relatedness have secondary role. 
 
In table II, we show the results of our validation for 
sample patterns. An Example for false positives that we 
found in the common parent group: the meanings of term 
apprehender are homographs: 
  knower, apprehender: a person who knows or apprehends. 
  apprehender: a person who seizes or arrests.

The cases in the column systematic and others are the 
cases that we think that they should be processed in a 
subsequent phase of our approach in the framework of 
approaching CORELEX systematic polysemy or cases, were 
the presence of the polysemous term in one of the synsets is 
inappropriate and should be removed from one of the 
synsets. An example for such cases is the term senate that 
appears in the synset and its direct hypernym:  
United States Senate, U.S. Senate, US Senate, Senate: the 
upper house of the United States Congress. 
   => senate: assembly possessing high legislative powers  
 
In 
Table 
IV, 
we 
present 
the 
classification 
of 
specialization polysemy. The total number of reduced 
polysemous words is 2139 words. The total number of 
merged synsets represents about 10% of the total processed 
cases. At the same time we have added 1045 new synsets 
and 2775 new is a relations, while have deleted 409 synsets 
and 409 is a relations.  This means that in our approach we 
have increased knowledge rather than decreasing knowledge 
to solve the polysemy problem.

To evaluate our approach, 1020 cases have been 
evaluated by two evaluators.  In the following Table V, we 
report the statistics of the evaluation, where the column 
polysemy type refers to homonymy, metaphoric, metonymy, 
or specialization polysemy and polysemy operation refers to 
creating missing parent, adding missing relation, or merging 
operation. Note that, polysemy operation is applicable in 
case of specialization polysemy. The table presents the 
agreement between the evaluators and our approach. The 
third row represents the number of cases, where at least one 
evaluator agrees with our approach.

924  ≈ 90.5% 
Evaluator 2 
945   ≈  92.5% 
855  ≈ 84% 
Partial agreement  
1006  ≈ 98.5% 
978  ≈ 96% 
 
As we can see from the results above, although the 
agreement with the approach is high, in many cases, the 
evaluators agree on the specialization polysemy type but 
disagree on the operation type. The explanation for this is 
that the operation is decided according to the nature of 
lemmas in both synsets as explained in section IV.

   CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the present paper, we introduced a pattern based 
approach for solving the polysemy problem in WordNet. Our 
approach deals and covers all polysemy cases at all 
ontological levels of wordNet. Furthermore, it improves the 
ontological structure of WordNet by transforming the

implicit relations between the polysemous senses at lexical 
level into explicit semantic relations. The manual treatment 
in two phases of the approach guarantees the quality of the 
approach result. We have tested our approach on polysemous 
nouns that have two senses and the results were promising.  
Our next step is to apply the approach on all polysemous 
nouns in WordNet. In a subsequent phase, we are going to 
extend our algorithm to handle verbs, adjectives and adverbs. 
 The main contributions of this work are at two levels: 
At the conceptual level, we are providing a new foundation 
towards the problem of polysemy. At the implementation 
level, we aim to improve the quality of NLP and 
knowledge-based applications, especially in the field of the 
semantic search.
