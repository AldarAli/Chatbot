Abstract — There are compelling reasons for building 
networks which are future-proof, scalable, and which will be 
able to accommodate power users with special needs in the 
future. However, while the backbone networks are typically 
ready for new trends such as coherent systems, the situation 
with access networks is different, often for economic reasons. 
In this article, we present a cost-effective solution based on 
open equipment which can be advantageous even outside the 
academia, research and education ecosystems. As an 
example, we describe our use of the Czech Light® family of 
devices within the central region of the CESNET's 
production network. 
Keywords – optical fiber network; metropolitan area 
network. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
National research and education networks (NREN) 
provide connectivity for universities, research centres and 
other advanced users. Their backbone networks use dense 
wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) coherent 
transmission systems rather routinely, and the data rates of 
100 Gb/s are quite common. Successful 1 Tb/s trials have 
been performed in networks where dark fibers are 
abundant and available for experiments [1] [2]. 
This transmission capacity situation is rather different 
in access parts of the networks. The DWDM systems are 
not deployed commonly and transmission speeds are 
usually limited to 10 Gb/s. Sometimes the legacy time 
division multiplexing (TDM) technology is still used. This 
stark contrast with the backbone networks is often caused 
by economic reasons as upgrades are not conducted that 
often.  
Moreover, there are certain new scientific applications 
with rather special requirements. Examples of these are an 
accurate time transfer, or a very stable frequency transfer. 
For these applications, increasing the transmission speeds 
to 100 Gb/s or even 1 Tb/s are not important and will not 
help when such applications are deployed [3]. The reason 
for this constraint is that the time and/or frequency transfer 
is not about ‘big data’ transfers, but rather about stable and 
very low jitter. An accurate time transfer uses speeds well 
below 1 Gb/s. A transmission of stable frequency consists 
of a so called continuous wave (CW) signal, i.e., a signal 
without any modulation because the frequency of photons 
is the useful property of the transmitted information.  
Very accurate time and ultra-stable frequency are 
crucial for many fields, for example sensing, metrology, 
navigation, geodesy, radio-astronomy, Earth surveying, 
seismology, fundamental physics, etc. The increased 
interest in the all-optical time and frequency transfers are 
manifested by the EU joint research project NEAT-FT [4]. 
Unfortunately, technical issues may arise when high 
speed coherent systems and time/frequency applications 
are operated together over a shared fiber infrastructure 
with regular data over DWDM [5]. 
In this contribution, we will describe some practical 
examples that show how CESNET has been able to 
overcome these economical and technical issues.

OPTICAL LAST MILES ISSUES 
The issues related to last miles are well-known and all 
operators have learned to deal with them. Sometimes Last 
Miles have been dubbed as First Miles to emphasize their 
importance for high speed optical networking. In an 
NREN ecosystem, the last miles' problems cannot be 
solved by means of wireless networking because capacity 
(or bit rate) is not large enough for big demanding 
applications. With the higher bit rates, one has to utilize 
higher carrier frequencies, but their reach decreases 
significantly.  
One example of such demanding application can be the 
ultra-high definition video transmission required for 
medical applications [6]. Moreover, new applications such 
as hard real-time controls require very low and constant 
jitter which can be satisfied successfully with an optical 
fiber [7]. Real-time network services are needed for an 
interaction with external processes, in other words for any 
processes running outside the network. Examples of these 
use cases include collecting data from remote sensors or 
telescopes, or remote machine control. The importance of 
these topics can be found, for example, in the Strategy 
document for the pan-European network GÉANT for the 
2020 time frame [8].   
 To provide new opportunities for the research, 
education and scientific community, CESNET has 
developed new equipment – the Czech Light® family of 
advanced photonic devices. All of the Czech Light® 
devices are open. The word ‘open’ means that third parties 
are allowed to modify the Czech Light® devices, so it is 
easy to deploy them in new networking scenarios. The 
Czech Light® devices can be also customized by power

end users, e.g., by augmenting them with a custom, 
specific control software. This is usually not possible with 
equipment from traditional big vendors.  
III. 
CESNET SOLUTIONS FOR THE LAST MILES 
Dark fibers have been used in the CESNET network 
for many years. The first dark fiber was lit back in 1999, 
with Packet over SONET (PoS) technology with 2.5 Gb/s 
speed. At that time electro-optical regenerators for 
SONET/SDH were the primary option for extending the 
reach. Later on, optical amplifiers started to emerge, 
especially when optical gigabit Ethernet was deployed in 
metropolitan (MAN) and even wide area networks 
(WAN). 
The Czech Light® optical amplifiers (CLA) have been 
developed by CESNET to overcome limitations of the 
then-available optical equipment. The most significant 
drawback of contemporary commercial offerings was the 
lack of standardized monitoring capabilities. Support for 
the de-facto standard Simple Network Monitoring Protocol 
(SNMP) was one of the key requirements for practical 
deployment for any NREN or Internet Service Provider 
(ISP).  
The 
Czech 
Light® 
amplifiers 
are 
based 
on 
commercially available modules of Erbium doped fiber 
amplifier (EDFA). The Czech Light® family of devices 
also 
include 
reconfigurable 
add-drop 
multiplexers 
(ROADM), wavelength selective switches (WSS) or 
tuneable dispersion compensators (TDC). All of these 
devices consist of the optical module, an embedded Linux 
system, and essential control electronics. The Czech 
Light® devices are housed in a standard rack chassis of 
size 1U or 2U, and can be customized on demand. 
Various Czech Light® products are protected by 
several patents in the EU [9] and within the US [10] [11] 
[12].As of 2015, the Czech Light® equipment is used on 
4890 km of the CESNET networks, including 2012 km of 
bidirectional single-fiber transmission. 
Figures 1 to 4 show the up-to-date situation with Czech 
Light® equipment deployed in some of the important 
optical last miles in the central area around Prague (Praha).  
Fig. 1 shows a bidirectional single fiber line between 
Praha and Dolní Břežany, where the Extreme Light 
Infrastructure (ELI) is located. This design features so 
called one-side amplification, where an active device is 
located at one end of a fiber line only. In this case it is one 
optical amplifier Czech Light® with two independent 
modules, one serving as a power amplifier (booster) and 
another one serving as a preamplifier.

Řež, a site of numerous research centres and institutions.

Fig. 3 shows the ring Praha-Řež-Jenštejn-Praha which 
is used to increase reliability of a critical part of the 
network. Both remote locations are hereby reachable from 
two geographically different directions. Within this path, 
only the Řež-Jenštejn segment is built on a bidirectional 
single-fiber line. Both end of the fiber in Praha terminate 
at the same physical location.

Břežany-Praha for ELI and BIOCEV. Vestec hosts the 
Biotechnology and Biomedicine Centre (BIOCEV) of the 
Academy of Sciences and Charles University. The entire 
ring is built upon bidirectional single-fiber segments. Both 
ends of the fiber ring in Praha terminate at the same 
physical location.

Figures 3 and 4 also demonstrate the deployment of 
multiple Czech Light® ROADMs. These optical last miles 
based on the Czech Light® equipment therefore support 
dynamic, on-demand reconfiguration in response to a 
remote command. This feature allows CESNET to better 
optimize usage of its fiber pool as future requests for 
circuits arrive. As an additional reference, Fig. 5 shows the 
schematic topological runs of the two described dark fiber 
rings, with a major part of their length being deployed over 
bidirectional single fiber lines.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented the feasible technical 
solutions of the optical last miles used in the Czech NREN 
CESNET. The added value of the CESNET solutions is 
twofold: economic feasibility allowing for higher 
transmission 
capacity 
and 
openness 
allowing 
for 
deployment of new applications without any restrictions.
