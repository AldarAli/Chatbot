Abstract— Security Operation Center is known as a centralized
team within the organization working against critical cyber
threat by mainly analyzing logs. This paper points out the
duality of information on Security Operation Center and
proposes several issues according to its new security scheme
and also raised awareness to protect confidential business
information and employees’ rights of privacy.
Keywords—Security Operation Center; logs; Dual Data
Structure; Information Security Policy.

INTRODUCTION
An increase in sophisticated cyber attacks seems to be all
over the world. The essential cause of this fact is that the
Internet is open and free. Although this aspect brings great
advantages in our highly informed society, it causes the
threat of cyber attacks. Security Operation Center (SOC)
specializes in investigating cyber attacks by analyzing logs
[1]. Security Information Event Management (SIEM) is a
related technology for analyzing logs automatically [2]. In
other words, analyzing the logs is essential to make counter
strategies against cyber attacks. However, the results of
analyzing of logs include not only cyber attack data, but also
confidential business intelligence and private information.
This paper points out the recognition of dual data structure in
data flow of SOC and the necessity of developing an
information security policy on SOC.
II.
DATA STRUCTURE
A.
Dual data structure on the information security
To study the data flow in an enterprise computer system,
we consider the Enterprise Architecture (EA), which is a
methodology or a guideline for entities in an enterprise to
normalize information and optimize business strategies [3].
Then, we study the data flow among the entities which
compose the EA. As depicted in Fig. 1, data flow between
entities is an objective of our study. Business process causes
data flows between entities. At the same time, the result of
observing or monitoring the data by SOC includes business
data flow as well as intelligence data or private data. In this
study, we refer to this fact as “dual data structure”.
Let us take an example to understand the duality of data
mentioned above. One might easily recognize that most of
the log data might be business relating data. However, very
small combinations of log data, very difficult to find, might
possibly be related to cyber attacks, although each log does
not indicate the illegal action. This means the log data has
another
aspect
of
information
relating
to
business
intelligence as well as cyber attack information.
Data confidentiality should be classified into three ranks
(High, Middle, and Low) in designing of an information
security policy [4]. It seems that the low rank data takes a
low risk; however, it might be reclassified into a high risk
data after being analyzed by SOC. This implies low rank
data cannot be assumed as low risk data without analyzing.

changes
several
aspects
in
information security architecture as follows.
1) Dual Data Structure in SOC changes Reference Monitor
Model (RM)
In designing SOC and the related RM concept [5],
technical qualification needs to be reconsidered as an
essential security model. In Fig. 2, the log database is
produced by each monitoring log data and, after analyzing
the log database, new confidential information will emerge.
It indicates that security requirements have to focus on the
issue of dual data structure when building SOC scheme as
well.
“Dual data structure in their information is shown by
analyzing the information between Entities.”

2) Dual Data Structure in SOC relating privacy
The basic structure of log data contains the user
information, such as, ID information, or name, time, subject,
object and behavior as depicted in Fig. 3. This issue should
be
under
the
privacy
impact
assessment
[5]
and
Tokenization
or
Anonymous
is
also
under
the
consideration to be introduced into the log data structure.

C. Understanding Dual Data Structure
To understand the essential meaning of Dual Data
Structure, we suppose the concept of “Unknown unknowns”
[6]. Critical targets of SOC are “Unknowns”. They are
almost impossible to identify. In other words, under the
condition of “unknown unknowns”, SOC is working on daily
missions to analyze unknowns of cyber attacks.
Professionals of Information Security in SOC should
transfer the status “Unknown unknowns” to the status
“Unknown known”. This means that they present the actual
attack evidence from the results of SIEM by their experience
or
the
outside
information,
and
transfer
findings
to
managerial persons of the enterprise. In case of both outside
or inside SOC analyzing log data which belongs to an
enterprise, a professional has the responsibility to analyze the
results.
D. The issue of security policy relating to SOC
We have studied several aspects of data relating to SOC
in terms of RM, privacy rights. Further discussions about
information security policy related to duality are as follows.
1) Data handling policy of DB based on log data
Those data should be kept in highly confidential status
and integrity of the data should be kept safe.
2) Review of Privacy impact assessment
Privacy impact analysis should be studied in design stage
of SOC as well as operational stage.
3) Outsourcing of SOC work
Review the risk of outsourcing of SOC taking into
account the duality of SOC data. We would like to
suggest that outsourcing of SOC work had better be
avoided.
III. CONCLUSION
This paper points out a duality in EA data. From the
comprehensive thoughts, it is concluded that recognition of
dual data structure and necessity of developing information
security policy regarding SOC must be argued.
This idea contribution raised the importance to consider the
dual aspect in information security. The followings are
expected for further study.
1) Information security policy of SOC
To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no security
policy relating to SOC which is taking duality into
account.
2) Advanced analyzing logs in duality
Maching learning is the new trend in analyzing logs.
Duality in the result of analyzing logs must be governed
by the above information security policy.
