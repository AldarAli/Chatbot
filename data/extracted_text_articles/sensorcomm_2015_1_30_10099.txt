Abstract— The battery lifetime is the most important issue in a 
wireless sensor network (WSN). As the battery lifetime is 
restrictive in WSN, energy efficiency is very important. In case 
of outdoor monitoring, the data of temperature has a feature 
which changes slowly. If the value of temperature does not 
change constantly, the network communication has to extend 
sensing period because it is the most energy consuming aspect 
of the battery. In this paper, we propose optimized temperature 
sensing period (OTSP) for efficient energy consumption. The 
main ideas of OTSP are that the network communication find 
successive stable section through proposed algorithm and the 
network communication reduce the wireless temperature 
network period in stable section. We experimented on OTSP in 
the rooftop of the building in order to remain unaffected by 
environments. The result of experiment indicates that OTSP 
reduces the energy consumption and extends the battery lifetime 
as compared with temperature sensing system.  
Keywords- battery lifetime; energy consumption; wireless 
sensor network; temperature sensor

 INTRODUCTION 
WSN is used to monitor the various areas of the 
environment for implementing an IoT-based technology as 
used for the purpose of collecting and transmitting the data. 
Applications of WSN are used in the domain ecology, climate, 
environment, industry, transport, fire monitoring. 
 Most of these measurement of the wireless network 
environment is supplied with power through the battery. 
However, current battery technology cannot sufficiently 
supply the power in WSN. In addition, wireless 
communication constantly needs to consume the battery. As a 
result, research was done to minimize the WSN period, 
because the network communication approximately 20 
percent of the battery’s total energy consumption. 
 The data in WSN is divided into two types of feature, that 
is, the discontinuous and the continuous type of data. The 
discontinuous type of data is unstable, and the continuous type 
of data is stable. If the outdoor temperature is stable for a long 
time, the data in WSN is useless as we need to gather 
information about various data to optimize services. However, 
existing WSN system gathers all information although it is 
useless. To handle this problems, WSN has to minimize in 
stable section. 
In this paper, we proposed the system to maximize the 
battery lifetime using OTSP. The wireless temperature sensor 
network has both types of unstable feature and stable feature. 
This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we 
discuss the works related to existing WSN; in Section III, We 
present the algorithm and important schemes; in Section IV, 
we show the implement and the results; finally, some 
concluding remarks and directions for future work are given 
in Section V.

RELATED WORK 
WSN is required to extend battery lifetime. Improved 
battery lifetime in WSN has been proposed in several papers. 
 
A. Study on management of energy consumption to improve 
battery lifetime in WSN 
One of the energy management solution in WSN is 
network communication control, which is able to improve 
battery lifetime by analyzing data pattern. Wenguo et al [1] 
introduced the relationship between the energy utilization rate 
and the maximal network hop number. Akshay et al [2] used 
various models of the alkaline battery for maximizing its 
utilization and its lifetime. Suh et al [3] Software-based self-
test has emerged as an effective strategy for online testing of 
processors integrated in bad-safety critical applications. 
However, these studies mostly focus on energy saving without 
utilizing the information on the accuracy. 
 
B. Study on sleep mode to manage energy consumption in 
WSN 
As a similar method used in this paper, studies using sleep 
mode in WSN are performed [4]. Several studies use sleep 
mode for energy management. Two terminal reliability of 
WSN is calculated, using Monte Carlo Simulations. Then via 
simulation results the effects of sleep probability on consumed 
energy and network reliability are considered [5]. However, 
sleep mode introduced in these studies has not been applied in 
environment monitoring system in WSN. Therefore, to 
improve battery lifetime in WSN, network communication 
control using sleep mode is needed

and important scheme, the proposed paper discusses the 
problem of temperature sensing systems. 
 
 
Figure 1. Data of temperature graph for daytime 
The proposed system controls the network communication 
to minimize sensing period. The value of temperature is 
changed into environments (e.g., sunrise, sunset, wind, clouds, 
etc.) during daytime. The temperature variation during a 
certain period can be divided into two types. One type is much 
temperature variation, which is important to apply service 
models. The other type is little temperature variation, which is 
useless if it maintains for a long time. As shown in Fig. 1, the 
temperature graph for daytime has little temperature variation 
which is called stable part. If sensing period extends to sleep 
mode for stable part, it can get improved battery lifetime by 
saving network communication in WSN. Therefore, it is 
necessary to properly set the value according to temperature 
characteristics. 
 
A.  An optimized temperature sensing period Algorithm 
Fig. 2 illustrates a flowchart of an optimized temperature 
sensing period algorithm. Low data change is received from 
temperature degrees through embedded system per proposed 
method. The successive stable section denotes that the current 
data is stable state. 
 The proposed optimized sensing period algorithm adjusts 
sensing period based on the successive stable section of 
temperature, which are inputted via embedded systems. The 
value of temperature degrees at the latest is 𝑥𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝.𝑛, the value 
of sensing time intervals that is a gap between previous 
sensing time is  ∆𝑥, the value of temperature variation that has 
been changed differences degrees at the latest is 𝑎𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝.𝑛, the 
time that has been aggregate successive stable section is 𝑆𝑎.𝑛. 
The procedures are composed of three steps.  
 
 
Figure 2. A flowchart an optimized temperature sensing period algorithm. 
Step 1. A value of current temperature degrees through 
sensor is 𝑥𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝.𝑛. Then, calculates ∆𝑥 which is sensing time 
intervals at the latest and 𝑎𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝.𝑛  which is temperature  
variation. 
Step 2. Check whether |𝑎𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝.𝑛| is less than or equal to 
0.1 that a measure effects of little temperature variation and 
wind and clouds, than class stable section and add 1 point in 
𝑆𝑎.𝑛. If |𝑎𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝.𝑛| is greater than 0.1, than initialize 𝑆𝑎.𝑛 and 
operate sensing. 
Step 3. Check whether 𝑆𝑎.𝑛 is greater than or equal to 3, 
then operate sleep mode. If 𝑆𝑎.𝑛 is less than 3, then operate 
sensing. 
It is possible to derive the optimized sensing period, which 
can save energy at the maximum without useless sensing 
section through the proposed algorithm. 
The proposed system can reduce energy consumption via 
interaction with the information about temperature variation.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. Hardware of an optimized temperature sensing period 
Fig. 3 shows a prototype of an optimized temperature 
sensing period. The main processor is a 16-bit micro controller 
unit (MCU). It is used for performing the main tasks such as 
complex event processing, processing of priority based 
scheduling algorithm, the provision of sensing period, pattern 
generation, and situation analysis. A ZigBee transceiver is 
used for communication with other networked devices. We 
used a 250 kbps/2.4 GHz ZigBee transceiver of Arduino 
Module. The metering circuit plays a role in measurement of 
the temperature degrees. The system is composed of 
temperature sensor module, MCU and communication 
interface. We operate parallel two systems, which are 
temperature sensing system and OTSP system in order to 
compare energy efficient system. 
 
B. Experiment 
We deployed OTSP system on the rooftop of the building 
in order to remain unaffected by environments. We analyzed 
proposed system according to two different methods. The 
results presented in the following were collected from 8:00 
A.M to 6:00 P.M for four days.  
 
Figure 4. Daytime temperature graph from 8 A.M to 6 P.M and point of 
sleep mode in stable section. 
We conducted experiment with two different systems that 
are the temperature sensing system and OTSP system. The 
temperature sensing system performs sensing of remaining 1 
minute period. The OTSP system performs scheduling of 
operation 
mode/sleep 
mode 
according 
to 
previous 
temperature variation. The sensing period on sleep mode is 
remaining 2 minutes. Fig. 4 shows the sleep mode using OTSP 
in stable sections. The result show that almost point of sleep 
mode lie at stable section. Therefore, the OTSP system has 
little effect of services.

Figs. 5 and 6 show the sensing counts for four days. As 
shown in Fig. 6, the value of network communication is 
reduced by 30.1 percent through OTSP system.

Fig. 6 shows the sensing counts for four days. The result 
shows that the average sensing counts of temperature reduce.

Simple experiment was performed to evaluate the above 
optimized temperature sensing period for improved battery 
lifetime. The performance of the proposed OTSP depends on 
average sensing counts during four days.  
Therefore, the effectiveness of the above an optimized 
temperature sensing period can be evaluated by analyzing the 
improvement of battery lifetime of WSN using (1) to (4).

CONCLUSION 
Saving energy has become one of the most important 
issues in WSN. The network communication approximately 
20 percent of the battery’s total energy consumption. The 
main ideas of OTSP are that the network communication find 
successive stable section through proposed algorithm and the 
network communication reduce the wireless temperature 
network period in stable section. An optimized temperature 
sensing period algorithm was proposed. The proposed OTSP 
can be easily modified and cost effectively implemented. We 
deployed OTSP system on the rooftop of the building in order 
to remain unaffected by environments, and measured the 
sensing counts to evaluate the performance of battery lifetime. 
The proposed OTSP improves the total battery lifetime by 196 
days. It is expected that this work will contribute to providing 
guidance on the development of WSN.
