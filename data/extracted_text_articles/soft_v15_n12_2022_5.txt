Abstract—Asset formation for the retirement generation is a 
common issue around the world and has been widely discussed 
in various countries. We begin this paper by surveying the 
research on asset formation and life planning. Then, we show a 
data-driven life planning support framework based on social 
simulation. Based on the data and simulation results, this 
framework is intended to run simulations based on customer 
attribute data and to evaluate and validate measures for 
customers’ retirement assets. The social simulation model is 
constructed based on finance theory. Machine learning 
methods are used for the analysis of customer features and 
evaluation of the policy measures. Moreover, the simulation 
results are represented by experience mapping techniques. The 
following are the key findings: our framework 1) allows for 
effective discussion of measures to avoid the depletion of 
retirement assets and 2) allows simulation results to be widely 
interpreted and shared not only by model developers and 
analysts but also by decision-makers and frontline personnel.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we first survey the research on asset 
formation and life planning. Then, we show a life planning 
support framework built based on data and social simulation. 
This paper extends our prior paper presented at eKNOW 
2021 [1]. 
Asset formation for the retirement generation is a common 
issue around the world and has been widely discussed in 
various countries [1; 2]. As national, individual, and social 
measures, various measures are being discussed, such as 
raising the retirement age, establishing assets at a young age, 
and reducing spending. There has been little discussion, 
however, about asset withdrawal, and there is room to 
expand and modernize basic research and analysis to better 
consider current issues. To address this issue, it is important 
to have a simulation framework that enables effective 
discussion of measures to avoid depletion of retirement 
assets. In addition, it is desirable to have a method that 
allows simulation results to be widely interpreted and shared 
not only by model developers and analysts, but also by 
decision makers and those in charge in the field as shown in 
the survey section later. 
Our framework is designed to run simulations based on 
data of customer attributes and to evaluate and validate 
measures for customers’ retirement assets based on the data 
and simulation results. The social simulation model is built 
on finance theory [3]. Machine learning methods are also 
used for the analysis of customer characteristics and the 
evaluation of policy measures [4; 5]. Furthermore, we use 
experience mapping techniques to represent the simulation 
results extending prior research [6]. 
Here, this framework is intended to be used by financial 
planners and retail strategy planners who create life plans for 
their customers. 
As a exemplification of the proposed framework, this 
paper presents a specific case study that focuses on customer 
asset formation and withdrawal for the retirement generation. 
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section II 
introduces related work, Section III describes the proposed 
methodology, and Section IV explains the social simulation 
model we used. Section V provides applications, and in 
Section VI, we summarize the results. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we begin with a survey of asset formation 
and life planning (A). We begin by discussing portfolio 
selection theory among households, which is relevant to the 
issues addressed in this paper. Then, we examine surveys 
and research on asset formation and withdrawal in the 
postretirement period. Next, we introduce previous research 
on social simulation methods, the computer simulation 
methods used in this paper (B). There have been reports of 
research using social simulation to solve problems in social 
science. Finally, we mention the experience mapping 
techniques (C). The formal description of those techniques 
will be oriented in this paper for knowledge extraction from 
simulation results. 
A. Asset Formation and Life Planning 
1) Lifetime portfolio selection 
Under several assumptions, the optimal ratio of risky 
asset holdings in the classical theory of household portfolio 
selection is determined by the expected rate of return on 
risky assets, the interest rate on safe assets, the variance of 
the rate of return on risky assets, and the relative risk 
aversion [7; 8]. On the other hand, it has been pointed out 
that many households do not hold any risky assets [9], 
suggesting the existence of mechanisms that cannot be 
explained by classical theory alone.

 Bodie et al. [10] argued that the optimal risk asset ratio is 
high for young people with large human assets because they 
can cope with risks such as falling prices by increasing labor 
supply and working extra hours. Chen et al. [11] considered 
life insurance in addition to human asset allocation and 
investigated the optimal allocation of safe assets and life 
insurance when investment opportunities change over time. 
On the other hand, empirical approaches suggest that 
households’ investment in risky assets increases with age 
and then declines. Ameriks & Zeldes [12] showed that the 
allocation to equities over the life cycle follows a 
“mountainous” trend, using the United States (U.S.) as an 
example. This trend is common not only in the U.S. but also 
in other developed countries. In Japan, the stock allocation 
ratio peaks later than in the U.S. and Europe: 1) it reaches 
its maximum in the late 50s and 60s and 2) investment in 
stocks does not decrease substantially even after retirement. 
This implies that many Japanese households enter the stock 
market only after they get their retirement money [13]. 
 
2) Asset Formation and Withdrawal focused on 
Postretirement 
Asset formation for the retirement generation is a common 
issue around the world [2] and has been widely discussed in 
various countries [14]. In the U.S., the empirical benchmark 
is a fixed withdrawal rate of 4% of initial assets [15]. On the 
contrary, some critics argue that a fixed withdrawal rate is 
inefficient [16] and that “rules” should be set to vary the 
withdrawal rate and amount [17; 18]. 
In Japan as well, various surveys, studies, and calculations 
have been conducted regarding the formation and withdrawal 
of assets after retirement [19; 20; 21]. The Financial System 
Council’s estimate [20] calculated the required amount of 
funds to be withdrawn for an elderly couple and unemployed 
household in a simplified manner as follows: 
 
Monthly net income and expenditure (−55,000 yen/month) 
× 30 years ≒ △20 million yen 
 
This estimation was easy to understand and drew national 
attention. On the other hand, it is based on the average 
household income and expenditure (deficit of approximately 
55,000 yen per month) of an unemployed elderly couple 
whose only source of income is the pension and does not 
take into account each individual’s income and expenditure 
situation and lifestyle. Other studies have focused on 
investment strategies in asset formation and estimated the 
probability of depletion using annual time series paths of 
asset prices by Monte Carlo simulation [21]. While this 
study takes into account the risky asset investment strategy 
as well as the macroenvironment (inflation rate), it does not 
explicitly 
address 
various 
individual 
characteristics. 
Furthermore, there is a study that simulates the future 
depletion rate of financial assets in real terms using 
macroeconomic data such as the amount of financial assets 
and disposable income of individuals [19]. While this study 
takes into account an individual’s income and asset class, it 
does not address risky asset investment or inflation rates. 
Kikuchi and Takahashi constructed a social simulation 
model that expresses asset formation and withdrawal before 
and after retirement [3]. They presented a simulation of the 
customer’s asset situation at a future point in time, taking 
into account asset succession and price fluctuations of risky 
assets based on individual questionnaire data concerning 
asset formation and withdrawal before and after retirement 
[4; 5]. In this paper, we construct a life planning support 
framework based on the simulation model. 
B.  Social Simulation Method 
A social simulation is an approach in the social sciences 
that uses computer simulation to analyze social phenomena 
[22; 23]. In recent years, many studies have been grounded 
in real data in the field of social simulation [24; 25]. 
Yamada et al. [24] proposed a method that utilizes actual 
data and agent simulation to solve problems in business and 
industry. They classified various types of airport behavior 
using real-world data, and they used agent-based simulation 
to successfully reproduce congestion conditions when new 
equipment was installed at Fukuoka Airport in Japan [25]. 
Many such analyses have also been reported, e.g., corporate 
behavioral analysis via modeling based on finance theory 
[26; 27]. 
Detailed analyses such as Yamada et al.’s can facilitate 
onsite decision-making and are expected to greatly 
contribute to efficient decision-making in both social and 
economic activities. Understanding and interpreting the 
model structure and simulation results, on the other hand, 
are not limited to model developers and analysts but may be 
conducted widely by decision-makers and field staff related 
to management and administration. As a result, having a 
methodology for extracting knowledge and insights from 
simulation log data as well as a framework for sharing the 
extracted knowledge and insights among stakeholders is 
critical. 
C. Experience Mapping Techniques 
In the design of products and services, “design thinking” 
has been attracting attention [28; 29; 30]. As observational 
methods, experience mapping techniques such as persona–
scenario technique [31], customer journey map [32], 
empathy map, and so on [33] are used to uncover users’ 
latent needs. 
It is believed that the use of the experience mapping 
techniques has the effect of standardizing the perceptions 
among stakeholders, such as developers and marketers of 
products and services. This method may be an effective 
means of facilitating communication among stakeholders, 
which is a problem in the analysis of social simulation 
results, as discussed in the previous section. 
1) Persona–scenario technique 
In the field of marketing, human–computer interaction, 
and interaction design, “persona” is widely used as a 
method to support customer-oriented product and service 
design [6; 31; 34]. Persona marketing refers to the creation 
of an image of a person based on clear and specific data

about that real person. The use of personas leads to 
improving the quality of decision-making regarding the 
design of products and services. 
Table I provides a sample of a persona comparison 
poster [34]. In this paper, referring to the previous literature 
[6], we analyze and write down the results of our social 
simulation in the form of the persona comparison poster.

2) Other experience mapping techniques 
Other experience mapping techniques include empathy 
map, customer journey map, service blueprint, and so on 
[33] (Fig. 1). The customer journey map [32] is the most 
basic and widely used visual description method in service 
design, and it is used in this paper. We write down the 
results of our social simulation in the form of a customer 
journey map, as we did with the previous persona–scenario 
technique.

METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we outline our proposed life planning 
support framework for retirees based on data and social 
simulation. This framework is based on our previous studies 
[3; 4; 5; 6]. 
A. Outline 
Our framework is designed to run simulations based on 
real data of customer attributes and to evaluate measures for 
customers’ retirement assets based on the data and 
simulation results. Fig. 2 depicts an overview of the 
proposed framework, which corresponds to the concept of 
cyber-physical systems. Our framework consists of the 
following two procedures: 
1) Data augmentation by social simulation: Real data and 
simulation logs/paths are integrated and treated as 
augmented customer attribute data (See I in Fig. 2). 
2) Knowledge extraction: From the above-augmented 
data, knowledge about the sustainability of assets for each 
customer is extracted using machine learning methods and 
experience mapping techniques (See II in Fig. 2). 
 
In detail, the real data is a large survey data containing 
various attributes of customers (Section V-A). In this paper, 
we use cross-sectional data from individual questionnaires. 
Then, the social simulation model is constructed based on 
finance theory [36; 37] (Section IV). The model addresses 
asset formation in retirement, taking into account asset 
succession and risky asset price fluctuations. Based on the 
model, simulations are run to perform what-if analysis of 
the customer’s asset’s sustainability (Section V-D). The 
proportion of asset depletion in future, as obtained from the 
simulation results, is treated as augmented data for the 
original questionnaire data. Moreover, machine learning 
methods [38; 39] are used for the analysis of customer 
features (Section V-C) and evaluation of the policy 
measures (Section V-E). Finally, the results are represented 
using experience mapping techniques [34; 32] (Section V-F 
and G).

Here, this framework is intended to be used by financial 
planners and retail strategy planners who create life plans for 
their customers. 
 
B. The Usefulness of the Proposed Framework 
a) Perspectives on the advanced analysis of the 
sustainability of personal assets: 
Regarding asset depletion, many studies have analyzed 
macrostatistical data, e.g., the amount of financial assets and 
disposable income [19]. Furthermore, based on market data, 
the effect of price fluctuations on owned assets and asset 
depletion has been examined [21]. However, previous 
studies only used actual data to express some of the 
characteristics of individuals. In short, traditional analysis 
has frequently focused on people with specific characteristics 
to simulate asset depletion scenarios. Additionally, in those 
studies, ad hoc analysis was required for each person to 
examine possible measures to be taken. 
On the other hand, the proposed framework is capable of 
handling various attributes of individuals. Individual 
investment preferences and the amount of assets they will 
inherit in the future, for example, have rarely been addressed 
in previous studies. In addition, our framework can 
comprehensively and semiautomatically specify potential life 
planning measures for each customer. The framework will 
allow for effective discussion of measures to avoid the 
depletion of retirement assets. 
 
b) Perspectives on visualization of simulation results 
As mentioned in Section II-B, it is important to have a 
methodology for extracting knowledge and insights from 
simulation log data and a framework for sharing the 
extracted knowledge and insights among stakeholders. 
In the proposed method, simulation paths and logs, which 
are simulation results, are classified using machine learning 
methods and then visualized using experience mapping 
methods. By describing the results using those methods, a) 
the results can be compared in a graphical format, and b) the 
perspectives of customers and users can be expressed. This 
will allow the results to be widely interpreted and shared, not 
just by model developers and analysts, but also by decision-
makers and frontline personnel. Furthermore, it has the 
potential to improve communication among stakeholders 
during the analysis and sharing of simulation results. 
 
C. Limitation of the Proposed Framework 
One of the limitations of this analysis is that there is 
arbitrariness on the part of the modeler as to which attributes 
of the targeted individuals are reflected in the simulation 
model. Furthermore, in the process of extracting knowledge 
from simulation results, the analyst’s discretion in selecting 
which results to focus on and describe formally may exist. 
Of course, the social simulation model used must be an 
accurate representation of the real world. 
 
IV. 
SOCIAL SIMULATION MODEL 
In this section, we describe the social simulation model 
used in this paper. This model is based on our previous 
studies [3; 4; 5]. 
A. Outline 
As an example of the proposed framework, we show a 
simulation of the customer’s asset situation at a future point 
in time, taking into account asset succession and price 
fluctuations 
of 
risky 
assets 
based 
on 
individual 
questionnaire 
data 
concerning 
asset 
formation 
and 
withdrawal in old age. 
We constructed a computer simulation model that 
expresses asset formation and withdrawal before and after 
retirement (Fig. 3). 
Each actor in the model has a specific asset balance at a 
certain age. According to the actor’s status, each actor has 
both regular income and expenditure (cash inflow and 
outflow) 
and 
unexpected 
income 
and 
expenditure 
(depending on life events) (before and after retirement). 
Each actor’s characteristics are expressed statistically. In 
addition, by manipulating the attributes of the actors, what-
if analysis can be performed to examine responses to the 
implementation of a particular policy or decision-making． 
 
 
Figure 3. Conceptual diagram of a simulation model 
 
The assets held by each actor include cash, deposits, and 
risk assets. Risk assets are fully invested in a portfolio of 
traditional assets and provide returns according to the risk of 
the portfolio. Furthermore, regular income and expenditure 
are adjusted to account for inflation. The external 
environment is comprised of the portfolio’s risk–return 
profile, the inflation rate, and the variance of each, as 
described further below. 
B. Actor 
Let A be the set of actors and let #A = Nall. Actor ai has 
the following attributes in step t of the simulation and 
inflation scenario m: age agei,t, retirement age ageiretired, cash 
and deposit balance CAi,t, risk asset balance RAi,t, cash 
inflow CFIni,t,m, cash outflow CFOuti,t,m, cash flow from life 
event LEi,t, and total asset balance ASi,t = CAi,t + RAi,t. 
A = {ai = (i, agei,t, ageiretired, CAi,t, RAi,t, CFIni,t,m, CFOuti,t,m, 
ASi,t, LEi,t)} 
Here, age is expressed as follows. 
agei ∈ {agei,0, agei,0 + 1, …, ageiretired,… }

Then, the simulation time step, a single step represents 
one year in real-time. 
C. External Environment 
The return and inflation rate of portfolio j are generated 
in time series by Monte Carlo simulation as follows, where 
the number of trials is K. 
The portfolio return (annual) is expressed as 
Rinvestt = X1,t σ + μ. 
The inflation rate (annual) is given as 
Rinflationt,m = (ρX1,t + √(1−ρ2) X2,t) σinflation + μinflationm. 
Here, σ is the risk of portfolio, μ is the expected return 
rate of portfolio, σinflation is the standard deviation of the 
inflation rate, μinflationm is the expected inflation rate at 
scenario m, ρ is a correlation coefficient between portfolio 
and the inflation rate. X1, X2 ~ N (0,1), and cov [X1, X2] = 0. 
The cumulative value IRC of the inflation rate referred 
to as cumulative inflation rate, is expressed as 
IRCt,m = IRCt-1,m(1 + Rinflati°nt,m), IRC0,m = 1. 
D. Cash Inflow/Outflow 
Retirement cash inflows and outflows CF in step t are 
determined by considering the asset class to which actor i 
belongs and the cumulative inflation rate as follows: 
CFIni,t,m = CFIni,0,m (1 + IRCt,m), 
CFOuti,t,m = CFOuti,0,m (1 + IRCt,m) 
To keep the estimated possibility of withdrawal 
conservative, the net cash flow before retirement is set to 
zero. 
E. Asset Formation and Withdrawal Rules 
The cash and deposit balance and risk asset balance in 
each simulation step are varied according to the following 
rules. This expresses the preferential withdrawal of highly 
liquid cash and deposits at the asset withdrawal stage. 
if CAi,t + CFIni,t,m – CFOuti,t,m >= 0 
then 
 CAi,t+1 = CAi,t + CFIni,t,m – CFOuti,t,m + LEi,t 
RAi,t+1 = RAi,t (1 + Rinvestt) 
else 
CAi,t+1 = CAi,t + LEi,t 
 RAi,t+1 = RAi,t (1 + Rinvestt) + CFIni,t,m – CFOuti,t,m 
F. Asset Depletion Rate 
For the K trials, the number of times the asset balance 
becomes negative at age τ and inflation scenario m is 
denoted Kshortage, and the asset depletion rate, hereafter 
referred to as the depletion rate, is expressed as 
Ri,m,τshortage = Ki,m,τshortage/K. 
 
 
 
 
V. 
APPLICATIONS 
In this section, we show applications of our framework. 
A. Dataset: Individual Attributes 
We use the individual questionnaire data from the 
“Awareness Survey on Life in Old Age for Before and After 
Retirement Generations” conducted by the MUFG Financial 
Education Institute [40]. The survey was aimed at men and 
women aged 50 and up. The survey area was Japan, and 
there were 6,192 valid responses. This questionnaire 
thoroughly investigated each individual’s asset status 
(current asset balance and expected income/expenditure in 
old age), planned asset inheritance amount, investment 
stance, and outlook for old age, and so on. 
The basic statistics of the questionnaire on age, current 
asset balance, asset balance to be inherited, and percentage 
of risky assets held are shown in Table II [5]. 
 
TABLE II. BASIC STATISTICS OF QUESTIONNAIRE (abstract)  
 
 
B. Model Implementation and Simulation Environment 
The social simulation model presented in Section IV was 
implemented using the python language; the versions of 
python and jupyter notebook are 3.8.5 and 6.1.4, 
respectively. The simulation environment was MacBook Air 
(13-inch, 2017), processor: Intel Core i7 2.2GHz dual core, 
memory: 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3, OS: macOS Big Sur ver 
11.4. 
C. Feature Analysis of Individual Questionnaire Data 
Based on the above individual questionnaire data, we 
established several patterns of “possible person attributes” 
through segmentation by feature analysis [4; 5].

case based on the results of the elbow chart and silhouette 
analysis, which are frequently used to determine the number 
of clusters. There were 4,592 samples available for all items 
in the data.

From the obtained clustering results (clusters #1–#5), 
Figs. 4(a)–4(d) show the distribution of the answers to 
typical questionnaire items for each cluster as a box plot. 
The median age group age was 55–59 years for clusters 
#1 and #4, 65–69 years for cluster #3, and 70–74 years for 
clusters #2 and #5, as shown in Fig. 4(a). 
The median holding ratio of risk assets Rrisk was 0% for 
clusters #2 and #3, 0%–10% for cluster #4, 20%–30% for 
cluster #1, and 40%–50% for cluster #5, as shown in Fig. 
4(b). 
The median current balances of financial assets FAn°w 
was 2–3 million yen for cluster #3, 15–20 million yen for 
clusters #2 and #4, and 30–50 million yen for clusters #1 
and #5, as shown in Fig. 4(c). 
The median balance of financial assets to be succeeded 
FAfuture was zero for clusters #2–#5 and 20–30 million yen 
for cluster #1, as shown in Fig. 4(d). 
Risk asset holding ratio, i.e., investment preferences of 
individuals and the amount of assets they will inherit in the 
future have rarely been addressed in previous studies. So, 
our proposed framework is capable of handling various 
attributes of individuals. 
D. Asset Formation Simulation: Depletion Rate Based on 
Individual Questionnaire Data 
Using the social simulation model referred to in Section 
IV, we performed computer simulations of asset formation 
and withdrawal based on the cluster set described in the 
previous section (Table IV). Then, we estimated the asset 
depletion status of representative people who were typified 
by the individual questionnaire data [4; 5]. 
Here, the annual income and expenditure CFnet for each 
asset class was set from macro statistics data [41] according 
to 
the 
current 
balance 
of 
financial

a life event (asset succession) occurs. In this paper, the 
above parameters are called “Case of Making Basic 
Decisions.” 
Other parameter settings, e.g., the portfolio’s risk–return 
profile and inflation rate, are shown in Table V. Note that 
the risk–return of the portfolio was set assuming a portfolio 
comprising foreign stocks and bonds [3]. The expected 
inflation rates were according to three patterns, i.e., (1) no 
inflation (0%), (2) moderate inflation (actual results for the 
past 30 years in Japan [42]: 0.53%), and (3) 2% inflation 
(monetary easing target). Here, the standard deviation of the 
inflation rate was the same as pattern (2), which is the actual 
result for the past 30 years in Japan.

The depletion rate at age 90 and age 100 by cluster and 
inflation scenario is shown in Table VI [4]. 
 
TABLE VI. SIMULATION RESULT: DEPLETION RATES IN CASE OF 
MAKING BASIC DECISIONS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The depletion rate of cluster #4 increases according to 
the high inflation scenario, and the depletion rate of cluster 
#1 is zero in all scenarios. However, keep in mind that the 
simulation was based on the assumption that financial assets 
are inherited expectedly. In all scenarios, the depletion rate 
of cluster #3 was 100%. Cluster #2, similar to cluster #4, 
exhibits a high depletion rate in a high inflation scenario. 
Asset depletion was observed with a low probability in the 
limited case of high inflation at the age of 100 for cluster #5. 
 
E. Estimate of Impact of Various Decisions on Depletion 
Rates 
We conducted a what-if analysis in which the actors made 
various decisions to control asset depletion. By calculating 
feature importance using machine learning methods, we 
examined the effectiveness of these decisions [4]. 
We analyzed decisions that have a large effect on the 
depletion rate for the clusters set shown in Table IV. We 
considered the following decisions: 1) portfolio’s risk–
return profile, 2) retirement age, 3) curbing of expenditure, 
and 4) asset succession. 
• 
What-if analysis and calculating feature importance 
The parameter settings are shown in Table VII. Here, the 
assumed decision-making patterns are as follows. The 
annual income and expenditure CFnet by asset class has two 
patterns, i.e., with and without curbing of expenditure. The 
retirement ages are 60, 65, and 70 years. There are three 
asset succession patterns, i.e., 100%, 50%, and 0%, and four 
portfolio risk setting patterns, i.e., 18%, 12%, 6%, and 0% 
(returns are set according to the corresponding figures, i.e., 
6.37%, 4.68% 2.87%, and 0.01%; see reference [3]). For 
each cluster set, 72 decision-making patterns were generated. 
Note that the other parameters were the same as those 
shown in Table V. In this paper, the above parameters are 
called “Case of Making Various Decisions.” 
 
TABLE VII. Parameter Settings: Case of Making Various Decisions 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
Here, we focus on the status of asset depletion and 
nondepletion at the specific age for each cluster. The 
importance of variables that classify depletion and 
nondepletion for each cluster was calculated using the 
random forest method [39] (Fig. 5). 
For cluster #4, the importance of the portfolio risk setting 
was relatively high. Cluster #1 showed the highest 
importance in order of asset succession ratio, portfolio risk 
settings, and curbing of expenditure. For clusters #3 and #2, 
the importance of curbing expenditure was extremely high. 
In addition, cluster #5 had the highest importance in order of 
portfolio risk setting and curbing of expenditure.

Possible Effective Decisions for Each Cluster 
Next, from the results shown in Table VII and Fig. 5, 
we considered measures each individual can take to reduce 
the depletion rate (Table VIII).  
Cluster #4: High depletion rate in the high inflation 
scenario. Appropriate risk-taking for inflation hedging and 
increasing retirement age could be effective measures [Fig. 
5(a)]. 
Cluster #1: The depletion rate is low in all scenarios. 
However, this simulation assumed that financial assets are 
inherited as expected. Regarding variable importance, the 
ratio of asset succession was the highest [Fig. 5(b)], and 
appropriate and steady asset succession is important. 
Cluster #3: The depletion rate was extremely high in all 
scenarios. Note that curbing expenditure was the only option 
among the decisions compared in this paper [Fig. 5(c)]. For 
cluster #3, drastic measures are required, e.g., curbing 
expenditure and expanding social security. 
Cluster #2: The depletion rate was high in the moderate 
and high inflation scenario at age 100. Here, curbing 
expenditure is considered an effective action [Fig. 5(d)]. 
Cluster #5: Here, the depletion rate was high in a limited 
scenario. As a countermeasure, it is conceivable to take 
appropriate risks [Fig. 5(e)]. This cluster showed a high 
proportion of risk assets (Table IV), and it is important to 
avoid excessive risk to prevent price fluctuations (decreases) 
of the held risk assets. 
Table VIII summarizes examples of actions each cluster 
could take to reduce the depletion rate. In addition to the 
results of the previous section (Table VI), our framework is 
capable 
of 
comprehensively 
and 
semiautomatically 
specifying possible life planning measures for each 
customer [4].

From this section onward, the above simulation results 
are formally described using the experience mapping 
techniques. First, we use the persona–scenario technique [6;

Table IX describes the contents of Tables IV, VI, and 
VIII. in the form of a persona comparison poster. Here, we 
exemplify Table IX (a) showing the moderate inflation 
scenario and Table IX (b) showing the 2% inflation scenario.

From the original questionnaire, attributes “Age group,” 
“Current balances of financial assets,” “Holding ratio of risk 
assets,” and “Financial assets to be succeeded” were 
selected and entered as the attributes obtained by feature 
analysis. Furthermore, the statuses “Depletion rate at age 
90” and “Depletion rate at age 100” were chosen and 
entered from the simulation results. In addition, effective 
measures to reduce the rate of depletion are described for 
each cluster. 
The benefit of using the persona–scenario method for 
formal description is that it allows you to see and compare 
the differences in attributes and states between clusters for 
each simulation scenario. This limits the ability of 
stakeholders other than modelers and analysts to interpret 
simulation results.

G. Knowledge Extraction Using Experience Mapping 
Techniques: Customer Journey Map 
This section provides a formal description of the 
simulation results using the customer journey map. Figure 6 
describes the contents of Tables IV, VI, and VIII in the form 
of the customer journey map [32]. Here, the cases of both 
clusters # 4 and # 1 are illustrated. 
 The attributes obtained by feature analysis from the 
original questionnaire are described in the “User profile” 
section. In addition, the “Scenario and Goal” section 
describes simulation scenarios and results (future state for 
each cluster). Furthermore, the entire period was divided 
into four phases based on the state of the actors in the 
simulation. Following that, we included a summary of the 
changes in the balance of assets held as well as the status of 
actors in each phase. 
The state of the actor is described in the balloon in the 
figure and is based on the simulation result. Discussions 
between stakeholders, on the other hand, can be used to 
describe the thoughts and feelings of expected customers 
and users. Thus, the formal description of simulation results 
using a customer journey map has the advantage of allowing 
the customer or user’s perspective to be expressed as well.

VI. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this paper, we first surveyed the research on asset 
formation and life planning. Then, we showed a life 
planning support framework built based on data and social 
simulation.  
This framework was designed to run simulations based 
on data of customer attributes and to evaluate and validate 
measures for customers’ retirement assets based on the data 
and simulation results. The social simulation model was 
built using finance theory. Machine learning is also used for 
customer feature analysis (k-means method) and policy 
measure evaluation (random forest method). Furthermore, 
the simulation results were represented using experience 
mapping techniques (persona-scenario technique and 
customer journey map).  
As a exemplification of the proposed framework, we 
showed a specific case study that focuses on customer asset 
formation and withdrawal for the retirement generation. As 
the data source of customer attributes, we used large-scale 
individual questionnaire data. 
The main findings are as follows: 1) our framework could 
effectively discuss measures to avoid the depletion of 
retirement assets. In addition, our framework is capable of 
dealing with a wide range of individual characteristics (Fig. 
4) and specifying comprehensively and semiautomatically 
possible life planning measures for each customer (Tables 
VI and VIII). 2) Using our framework, simulation results 
can be widely interpreted and shared not only by model 
developers and analysts but also by decision-makers and the 
frontline personnel. By describing the simulation results 
using experience mapping techniques, a) the results could be 
compared in an overview (Table IX), and b) the viewpoints 
of customers and users can be expressed (Fig. 6). 
Limitation of the proposed framework are: 1) there is 
arbitrariness on the part of the modeler as to which 
attributes of the targeted individuals are reflected in the 
simulation model, 2) in the process of extracting knowledge 
from simulation results, the analyst’s discretion in selecting 
which results to focus on and describe formally may exist, 
3) the social simulation model used must be an accurate 
representation of the real world. 
By using the proposal system, financial planners and 
retail strategic planners could obtain knowledge feedback 
directly related to life planning. It is expected that financial 
institutions will also be able to provide detailed advice and 
counsel. 
Future work would be to examine formal description 
methods for interpreting and sharing simulation results.
