Abstract— Self-care is what people do for themselves to 
establish and maintain health, prevent and deal with illness. A 
clinical guideline is a document with the aim of guiding 
decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and 
treatment in specific areas of healthcare. Clinical guidelines 
have been in use for thousands of years during the entire 
history of medicine. An interesting question arising from these 
notions is whether clinical guidelines can be used in self-care to 
ensure that the treatment is in line with the medical 
recommends. A problem, however, is that the retrieval 
methods of clinical guidelines are mainly aimed at healthcare 
personnel who are taught to retrieve relevant guidelines. In 
order to simplify patients’ tasks in retrieving guidelines, we 
have designed an ontology (vocabulary) for annotating clinical 
guidelines. A patient can then query clinical guidelines by 
keyword expressions, which are intuitive and clear for patients. 
Technically annotations are presented according to the 
Semantic web technologies, and so they are machine 
understandable. Further, guidelines can be retrieved from a 
variety of sources within one query. In addition, the system can 
be easily extended such that guidelines and other relevant 
health-oriented information can be retrieved in a query.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, health care provision is moving towards self-
care from the physician centric model where the treatment 
decisions are made almost exclusive by physicians. This is a 
challenging trend as it is estimated that 70% to 95% of all 
illnesses could be managed without the intervention of a 
doctor [1], i.e., by self-care [2]. 
To promote self-care some Personal Health Records 
(PHRs) already provide links to websites that provide 
information concerning patient’s treatment and medication. 
However, many patients have regarded these sites to be 
overly commercial, and often patients cannot determine the 
source of the published medical information [3]. In addition, 
browsing these pages has turned out to be long lasting and 
frustrating as their provided medical information is not 
relevant, is overly specific for patients or is overly superficial 
[4].  
After all, success in self-care requires patients to have 
relevant medical treatment information [5]. Traditionally, 
such information is provided for physicians in clinical 
guidelines, which are document with the aim of guiding 
decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and 
treatment in specific areas of healthcare [6].  
Clinical guidelines are based on an examination of 
current evidence within the paradigm of evidence-based 
medicine (EBM) [7]. It emphasizes the use of evidence from 
well designed and conducted research in healthcare decision-
making [8]. EBM is one of the most significant 
developments in the clinical use of information over the last 
decades [9]. Practicing EBM represents a thorough change in 
the way that physicians are taught to think and retrieve 
relevant guidelines [10].   
There are a variety of ways how the digital volumes of 
guidelines can be organized. For example, guidelines may be 
grouped in an alphabetic order of the disorders they deal 
with, grouped by specialities, or grouped by body parts. 
Accessing guidelines from such digital volumes have proven 
to be easy for physicians and healthcare professionals as 
healthcare providers are obliged to know how to find 
relevant guidelines. 
Instead searching relevant guidelines from such volumes 
is not necessary a trivial task for patients.  This is regrettable 
as clinical guidelines are intended also for patients’ use. 
Furthermore, clinical guidelines have special versions for 
different user groups.  
Our argument is that clinical guideline oriented services 
should also provide specific retrieval methods for patients, as 
they are not taught to think in accordance with EBM.  For 
example, a pregnant patient may be interested to know 
whether she has some risks in using pain drugs. In this case, 
finding relevant information from guidelines dealing with 
pregnancy and from guidelines dealing with pain drugs may 
be long lasting and frustrating process.  
In order to develop appropriate retrieval methods for 
patients, we have annotated clinical guidelines by 
appropriate metadata items such as keywords and 
classification identifiers. A patient can then query clinical 
guidelines by Boolean expressions [11] comprising of 
operands and operations. The operands are the used 
keywords and the operands are typically “and”, “or”, and 
“not”. The Boolean model is intuitive and clear. For 
example, the query “pregnancy and pain drugs” returns the 
guidelines (if any) that are annotated by these keywords.  
Another problem concerning the retrieval of clinical 
guidelines is that they are fragmented.  That is, there are 
many sites publishing guidelines, and therefore searching 
relevant guidelines from a variety of sites is often hard and 
long lasting.  In order to avoid such weakness, a key point in 
our solution is that in one query patient can retrieve 
guidelines located in many web sites. This, however, 
requires that all the sites use the same vocabulary (ontology) 
and 
technology 
in 
annotating 
clinical 
guidelines.

Technically, in our solution, each site is assumed to provide 
a web service that supports SPARQL queries. SPARQL is a 
query language developed for Semantic web [12].  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, in 
Section II, we shortly present the architecture of the system 
that we are developing. Then, in Section III, we consider the 
Guideline ontology that we use in annotating guidelines. In 
Section IV, we give an example of a SPARQL query that 
exploits the Guideline ontology in searching guidelines from 
two data stores.  In Section V, we consider the extension of 
the system by medicinal data. Finally, Section VI concludes 
the paper by considering our future research.  
II. 
THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE GUIDELINE SERVER   
In our developed architecture, users (patients) retrieve 
clinical guidelines through the Clinical Guideline Portal (Fig. 
1). The portal provides a set of applications each providing a 
specific search method, such as searches based on keywords 
or body parts. These applications communicate with the 
SPARQL Processor, which access clinical guidelines 
through their Web Services.

A useful feature of the SPARQL Processor is that it is 
capable for querying many RDF-formatted [13] data sources 
within one SPARQL query.   
III. 
GUIDELINE ONTOLOGY    
An ontology characterizes the meaning of concepts and 
their relationships [14. Within computer science, an ontology 
is usually represented by using classes, properties, and their 
values as modeling primitives [15].  Hence an ontology 
provides a systematic way to standardize the used metadata 
items [16]. As an example consider our defined Guideline 
Ontology, which is graphically presented in Fig. 2.

Figure 2.  Guideline Ontology. 
In this figure, ellipses represent classes and rectangles 
represent data type as well as object properties. These 
representations are modeling primitives in OWL [17]. Object 
properties (e.g., belongsTo) relate objects to other objects (or 
to itself, e.g., requires), and datatype properties (e.g., 
specialityName) relate objects to datatype values. 
 
An instance of the Guideline Ontology is presented in 
RDF in Fig. 3. RDF is a key for representing machine 
understandable data. It is a data model with a variety of 
syntaxes for storing data files. By RDF we can express facts 
with tree-part statements called as triples. The subject 
identifies the thing being described, predicate is a property 
name, and object is property value. That is, each triple is 
like a little sentence that states a fact. However, RDF in 
itself does not bring interoperable semantics. It depends on 
the expression power of the used vocabulary. By a 
vocabulary we refer to a set of ontologies, which specifies 
the used terms and their semantics.  
 
In order to illustrate the dependency of RDF and 
ontologies consider the RDF-description (a set of RDF-
statements concerning the same subject) of Fig. 3. The 
RDF-description states, by using the Guideline Ontology as 
a vocabulary, that a guideline named Pregnancy has 
keywords pregnancy and pain drugs, and the guideline is a 
part of a guideline named gynaecological diseases. That is, 
pregnancy is a subclassification of gynecological diseases.

The Guideline Ontology enables to attach parenKeyword 
to each keyword meaning that keywords comprise 
taxonomies (hierarchies).  The logic behind taxonomy is that 
when one goes up the taxonomy toward the root, the 
keywords become more general, and respectively when one 
goes down towards the leaves the keywords become more 
specialized [16].  We can also state this in a more formal 
way: depending on the direction of the link each link 
between a parent and a child node represents a 
subclassification relation or superclassification relation. For 
example, type 2 diabetes is a subclassification of diabetes, 
and diabetes is a superclassification of type 2 diabetes.  
Taxonomies can be exploited in searching, if the used 
keywords return too many guidelines. For example, we could 
replace keyword diabetes by its subclassification type 1 
diabetes,  type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes (a 
condition in which women without previously diagnosed 
diabetes exhibit high blood glucose levels during pregnancy).

IV. 
GUERYING GUIDELINES FROM MULTIPLE 
DATASTORES BY SPARQL  
  SPARQL is a query language that is able to retrieve and 
manipulate data stored in RDF-format. It was made a 
standard by the RDF Data Access Working Group of the 
World Wide Web Consortium, and is recognized as one of 
the key technologies of the semantic web [18]. 
A SPARQL query specifies the pieces of data that meets 
the stated requirements. The requirements are described with 
triple patterns, which are similar to RDF triples but they 
include variables to add flexibility in how they match against 
the queried data [18].  
There is a variety of SPARQL technologies available for 
running queries against data both locally and remotely. For 
example, SPARQL provides two ways for querying 
remotely: using FROM keyword or using SERVICE 
keyword. In the former way the FROM keyword names a 
dataset to query that may be local or remote file. In the latter 
and our used way, instead of pointing at an RDF file 
somewhere, a SPARQL endpoint is pointed. An endpoint is a 
Web service that accepts SPARQL queries, runs the queries, 
and finally returns the result.  
Further, Federated Queries in SPARQL allow searching 
multiple datasets with one query. For each dataset is created 
a subquery which access datasets by using SERVICE 
keywords.  To illustrate this, consider the federated 
SPARQL query presented in Fig. 4. It accesses two datasets 
through SPARQL endpoints. The result of the query is the 
union of the results of the two subqueries. The query returns 
links (URLs) to those clinical guidelines that are annotated 
by the keywords pain drug and pregnant. The query is based 
on the ontology presented in Fig. 2 (the prefix no in the 
query refers to this ontology).

V. 
EXTENDING THE GUIDELINE SERVER   
The Clinical Guideline Retrieval System presented in 
Section II is focused only on retrieving relevant guidelines. 
However there are also websites that have information about 
medication, 
and 
thus 
they 
can 
provide 
valuable 
supplementary information for self-care. For example, a 
patient may be interested to know more about a pain drug 
recommend in a clinical guideline.  
A problem however is that most health-oriented web sites 
are developed only for human consumption, and so they as 
well as their metadata is not machine understandable. In 
order to transform their metadata in machine understandable 
format, we have developed an appropriate ontology (called 
Medicine Ontology) for annotating the documents that deal 
with medicine.   
A portion of the Medicine Ontology is graphically 
presented in Fig. 5. In this graphical representation ellipses 
represent classes and rectangles represent data type and 
object properties. Object properties relate objects to other 
objects while data type properties relate objects to datatype 
values. Classes, data type properties and object properties are 
modelling primitives in OWL.

Note that the Medicine Ontology and the Guideline 
Ontology are overlapping in the sense that they both include 
the class clinicalGuideline. As a result we can use the 
Medicine Ontology in annotating clinical guidelines by 
medicinal data. For example, in Fig. 6, the annotation 
presented in Fig. 3 is extended by stating that the instance 
deals with Aspirin.

Similar to the extension on Medicine ontology we can 
also introduce other ontologies as well. For example, 
introducing an ontology for the terms of welfare might also 
be useful.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
 
Web-based e-health models and the Semantic Web 
support each other: Web-based health-oriented services 
provide a new paradigm for sharing health information while 
Semantic Web enables the presentation of information in a 
machine understandable form. As a result the use of Web-
based e-health services is rapidly increasing. Yet, by using 
together a variety of services we can still achieve new 
services that would not be achievable by independently 
working systems. For example, we can achieve new 
outcomes by the interoperation of the systems developed for 
self-care, welfare, and smart homes. Technically the 
interoperation can be implemented by a SPARQL processor.  
So far we have used these technologies in developing a 
patient-friendly retrieve method for clinical guidelines. We 
have also extended this solution by the services that provide 
information about medicines. In our future work we will 
consider how the information of clinical guidelines, 
medication, welfare and smart home can be used together in 
developing new services.
