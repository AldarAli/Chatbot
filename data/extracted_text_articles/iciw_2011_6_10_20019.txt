Abstract—The application of weblogs in educational envi-
ronments is enjoying an increasingly good reputation. In this
paper, we describe our experiences with weblogs, supporting
the innovation seeking process ’design thinking’ that has
recently received attention in various ﬁelds of interest. In face
of this broad range of ’design thinking’ usage, it was surprising
to us, how little technology is employed in the corresponding
teamwork processes. In this paper, we therefore stress the
idea that weblogs may greatly support design thinking teams.
Firstly, by enabling and supporting the formation of team
communities across barriers of individual diversity, space and
time, and secondly by supporting the process of design thinking
itself.
Keywords-Web-based Collaboration; Management; Documen-
tation; Performance; Design; Experimentation; Human Factors.
I. INTRODUCTION
Nowaydays, no individual alone could ever know all
that there is to know [1]. To remain competitive in the
21st- century global economy, knowledge worker must be
increasingly specialized, and at the same time cooperate in
diverse setup teams.
Diversity has been credited with myriad positive outcomes
for team performance. Research, meanwhile has shown
that the performance advantages of diverse setup teamwork
are often found under very narrow conditions [2]. Both,
experimental and ﬁeld researches show that teams often do
not reach their potential [3]. When groups collaborate there
may be a tendency to loaf, to prematurely evaluate group
products, or for some individuals to dominate the group
process or distract the group from its goals.
This creates a demand for sophisticated coordination
and management [4]. Techniques that assure efﬁcient in-
teraction, appropriate leadership, and motivating goals shall
help groups overcome some of the negative forces. Design
thinking offers such a broad set of techniques and opens up
a space where creative teamwork can lead to innovation.
In this paper, we stress the idea that weblogs as such a
technique among others may greatly support the innovative
process of Design Thinking. Firstly, by enabling the forma-
tion of teams and communities across barriers of individual
diversity, space and time, and secondly by supporting the
process of design thinking itself. This paper underpins this
argumentation with the subsequent arrangement of sections:
The subsequent section introduces the general concept of
Design Thinking. Section three elaborates upon the question
to what extent modern information and communication
technology might enhance the process of Design Thinking.
In doing so it delves into the question to what extend
weblogs might be a general value-add in the teaching and
learning environment and particularly in the process of
Design Thinking. The following use case in section four is
about the implementation of a weblog in a highly dynamic
and innovative learning- and teaching- environment. It will
indicate that weblogs - if implemented correctly in a speciﬁc
context of application - can indeed greatly improve the
process of Design Thinking. We ﬁnally discuss terms of
success and give an outlook on further research questions.
II. WHAT IS DESIGN THINKING?
Recently, the term ’design thinking’ has received attention
in various ﬁelds of interest. The concept has its roots in
research on how designers comprise wicked problems [5]
and develop novel and viable solutions. Originally inves-
tigated in domains like architecture and industrial design,
the initial research focuses on cognitive models supporting
the generation, condensation, and creative transformation of
design knowledge and concepts [6] [7] [8]. Building on
that, design thinking was further developed and translated
into metadisciplinary frameworks detached from designers’
professional domains and was applied to various disciplines
and ﬁelds of innovation. Design agencies such as IDEO
promote working methods labelled with this term and inspire
large scale companies like Procter & Gamble and SAP to
design thinking’ approaches to innovation [1]. As such,
it supports the useful exchange of knowledge which has
shown to be crucial for innovation processes. Nowadays, the
term has therefore expanded into academic curricula beyond
traditional design programs, as, for instance, at Rotman
School of Management (Toronto) in the context of MBA
education, and at the d.Schools in Stanford and Potsdam
which offer design thinking education speciﬁcally to non-
designers [9] [10]. Here, post-graduate students learn to
work across their highly specialized particular disciplines in
142

diverse teams. This diversity includes cognitive, disciplinary
and social diversity. To enable the analysis and processing
of a wide scope of challenges and to deal with so-called
”wicked problems” [11], teams comprising members with
backgrounds in distinct disciplines are required. While the
team setup is interdisciplinary, the participants interact in an
open dialogue that transcends their respective disciplines,
accepting each perspective as of equal importance and
relating the different perspectives to each other. This ne-
cessitates exchange between domain languages and between
everyday practices of different ﬁelds. In order to facilitate
this approach, student teams are attended by teachers with
the competence of moderation, mediation, association and
transfer needed for this interdisciplinary mode of working
[12].
One of the rather well proven success metrics of de-
sign thinking projects is the alternating use of divergent
(where the questioner attempts to diverge from facts to
the possibilities that can be created from them - concept
domain) and convergent (where the questioner attempts to
converge on and reveal ”facts”- knowledge domain) thinking
which is actively promoted through frequent feedback and
testing. This change of thinking style results in a speciﬁc
creative process, open to iteration. Song et al. [13] show that
teams cycling between divergent and convergent patterns of
thinking and questioning perform better than teams that have
little variation over the design process. A frequent shift fur-
thermore promotes the pooling of unshared information [14]
[15], another established indicator for successful teamwork,
which is the basis of what is often described by ‘creating
something larger than the sum of the individual input‘.
The optimal team setup for Design Thinking teamwork
projects is diverse: interdisciplinarity, mixed social back-
grounds and cognitive diversity are some of the keywords
here. Design thinking allows these diverse setup teams to
develop a mutual understanding due to its strong emphasis
on team-based learning regarding both the problem and its
potential solutions.
Therefore, design thinking uses a broad variety of instru-
ments. In addition to the predominant use of whiteboards,
post-its and simple pens, digital documentation and com-
munication applications are employed as well. Most of the
time, a combination of analogue and digital instruments will
be reality.
III. SUPPORTING HIGH DIVERSITY TEAMWORK
Until this decade, the ability to use technology to en-
able networked innovation was very limited. The primary
technologies used to facilitate group innovation were paper
and, more recently, the whiteboard and dry erase marker.
Since then, a great deal has happened in the past decade that
is revolutionizing collaborative innovation. New communi-
cation and collaboration platforms, media, and tools now
allow many-to-many collaboration at a scale and cost that
could never have been achieved in the past. The Internet, an
overnight success three decades in the making, along with
its younger cousin the Web, really does change everything.
For the ﬁrst time, we now have tools that enable the
free exchange of information across many individuals with
remarkably low friction. Unfortunately, by seeking the rare
brilliance of a limited few instead of the statistically likely
success of the connected many, the ”lone genius” worldview
has limited our ability to make meaningful progress in
everything from technology, to organizations, to education,
and all the way to society [16]. We have done very little to
systematically develop technology to support the innovation
process. Overall, we are still in the ”horseless carriage” days
of living in a truly networked world. We can do better, but
how do we begin to engage this new way of being? We
believe a path to the future can be found by paying conscious
attention to evidence of what works in the world today, and
by asking: What are some of the enabling collaborative tools
available today? There are many web-enabled collaborative
tools that can be used for innovation seeking teamwork:
• Instant messaging: The ability to easily send short
messages back and forth to others who are present using
computers and mobile devices.
• Conference calling: Previously only available to cor-
porate entities, now virtually anyone with a connected
computer can initiate and participate in a conference
call with others worldwide.
• Video conferencing: This is the addition of live video
to conference calls or one-to-one messaging.
• Shared whiteboards and documents: These allow peo-
ple to interact in real time and share documents, photos,
drawings or presentations where anyone can edit or
annotate the shared media. It reinforces collaboration
and iteration.
• Virtual spaces: Web offerings to interact in real time
within a virtual three-dimensional world.
• Question and answer sites / Portals: Many websites
allow groups of people to easily share their knowledge
and create new value.
• Wikis and weblogs: Web tools that have become widely
available in recent years, making publishing quick and
easy. They encourage dialogue and sharing, via asyn-
chronous posting of comments, documents, discussions,
and editing of shared media. Blog search engines, such
as Google Blog Search and Technorati, BlogPulse or
BlogIntelligence [17], allow people to easily search a
huge quantity of very dynamic information. By tran-
scending time, space and language barriers, blogs thus
enable the exchange of knowledge across conventional
borders [18] [19] [20].
A. Weblogs in creative teaching and learning environment
The focus of this paper is on this last group of web-
enabled tools, since we believe that weblogs can spur the
143

process of Design Thinking most [21]. Technically, we-
blogs are an easy-to-use, web-enabled Content Management
System (CMS), in which dated articles (”postings”) as
well as comments on these posts are displayed in reverse
chronological order. Stephen Downes for instance postulates
to deﬁne weblogs independently of their content: ”Blogging
is something deﬁned by format and process, not by content”
[22]. Blogs are therefore a form of micropublishing that are
at ﬁrst undeﬁned regarding their ﬁeld of application [23].
This undeﬁned point of origin makes them so ﬂexible for
numerous other potential purposes, beginning with personal
diaries, reaching over to knowledge- and activity manage-
ment platforms, and ﬁnally to content-related and journal-
istic web offerings. Weblogs belong to the group of ”social
software”: simple, easy-to-use, and ﬂexible applications that
not just enable, but also facilitate cooperative gathering of
content. The consent among all currently existing social
software tools next to weblogs, is that the surplus value
is generated out of collaborative (social) activity. Social
software therefore enables afﬁliation to (social) networks,
as well as structuring and channeling of attention towards a
certain ﬁeld of interest [21].
Research on computer-based or electronic brainstorming
has found that electronic groups can perform about as well
as or better than nominal groups [24]. With the electronic
technology, group members can share ideas simultaneously,
be anonymous to other group members (low evaluation
apprehension), and be accountable for their individual per-
formance on their station (low social loaﬁng). On top of that,
insuring individual accountability can enhance performance
in groups [25]. Kayser [26] stresses the similar experimental
ﬁnding, that the use of a written or electronic exchange pro-
cess is one important factor to enable groups to reach a high
level of creativity. This is due to the fact that team sessions
should be followed by individual idea-generation sessions to
fully tap the cognitive beneﬁts of an exchange process. The
individual part structures the process to minimize production
blocking, evaluation apprehension and social loaﬁng.
The application of weblogs in teaching or learning en-
vironments is as a consequence enjoying an increasingly
good reputation. Diverse authors attribute blogs the potential
to be a transformational and innovation-enhancing technol-
ogy in this regard [23]. Summarizing the ﬁndings of their
qualitative study, Eﬁmova and Fiedler [27], for instance,
pool the beneﬁts of the technology through the following
characteristics:
• The representation of multiple perspectives
• Revelation of synergies of individual and collaborative
learning,
• The acquisition of meta-learning-strategies as well as
• The facilitation of access to experts.
It seems to be a competitive advantage when students
prepare, document and allocate their work, questions, sug-
gestions or recommendations in form of postings in a
quick and easy to handle ready-made manner [21]. Highly
ranked institutions such as the Harvard Law School start
to strategically implement weblogs as digital portfolios for
their student- and teaching body [23].
The core of a blog is a so-called ,personal learning
space’ in which personal artifacts are largely shared with
a non-uniform group of audiences. The individual process
of students is hereby documented and can at all times be
reﬂected and reused by themselves and all other poten-
tial stakeholder. This space quickly becomes a complex
ePortfolio [28], deﬁned as ”[...] a Web-based information
management system that uses electronic media and services
to enable learners to build and maintain a digital repository
of artifacts for demonstration of competence and reﬂection
on their learning” [29].
B. Weblogs – a Design Thinking supporting technology
The usage of a weblog as central and strategic point of
information and communication within a design thinking
process offers not only the integration of all information
collected via these tools, it supports furthermore an active di-
vision between collaborative and individual working phases.
This is crucial for a successful integration of as diverse
knowledge and ideas as possible. There is a misbelieve,
that teamwork means working in a group at all times of
a project. It has been proven to be wrong [30]. Instead, it is
crucial for the success of teamwork, to shift between face
to face group interaction and individual action. This allows
all team members to work at their speed and to put forward
their ideas without being interrupted or rated before an idea
is fully elaborated. It also helps the team to grow together
and to value each member as an individual, if they have the
chance to put forward their knowledge, ideas and remarks
in individual sessions.
This moment of true teambuilding is what most design
thinking methods are designed for: brainstorming, story-
telling, user research, prototyping and many more are neither
new nor unique. Their power lies in the right combination
and application over a creative thinking process. All these
methods support the active solidarization of the individuals
into one team, following the similarity-attraction paradigm.
According to Mannix and Neale [31], the predictions of
this paradigm are straightforward: Similarity on attributes
such as attitudes, values and beliefs and behavior facilitate
interpersonal attraction and liking - basic needs for a trust-
and successful collaboration.
IV. USE-CASE D-SCHOOL BLOG
The following use case is about the implementation of
a weblog in a highly dynamic, modern and innovative
learning- and teaching- environment that focuses on the
innovational culture of ”Design Thinking”. It will indicate
that weblogs - if implemented correctly in a speciﬁc context
144
ICIW 2011 : The Sixth International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services

of application - can indeed improve the traditional and
conservative way of education [21]. Our use case supports
Ojala’s reasoning that blogs give room to alternative views
and opinions and inaugurate a distinct culture of thinking
outside the mainstream [18].
A. Motivation and Background
The initial motivation to start the D-School-blog-project
was to support the so-called ”Innovation Lab”, set up by
the Hasso Plattner Design Institutes of Potsdam (Germany)
and Stanford (USA) at the world’s biggest IT fair CeBIT in
Hannover in 2009 [32].
On each of the seven fair days, the lab used a predeﬁned
design thinking process, to develop original ideas for daily
challenges with the overall goal to ’humanize’ IT. CeBIT
visitors, as well as the American and German students and
professors from their respective locations in Stanford and
at the fairground were joining forces in big, creative and
interdisciplinary team in these 24-hour projects to develop
fresh ideas for user-friendly products and services. The
overall goal of the ,Innovation Lab’ was to turn CeBIT into
an opportunity for every fair visitor to experience innovation
ﬁrst- hand and to show that innovation can be taught and
learned.
Communication of preliminary results within the dis-
tributed team was supported by the employment of free tools
and web services such as SKYPE, YOUTUBE, PICASA WEB
GALLERIES and more. Anyone with Internet access was able
to follow, comment and contribute to the progress of the
Innovation Lab through the ’D-School-Blog’.
B. Design, Structure and Content
For creative endeavours that require composition of novel
artifacts, enhanced interfaces shall facilitate the exploration
of alternatives, prevent unproductive choices, and enable
easy backtracking. Therefore the interface is of crucial im-
portance. Another requirement is to ﬁnd acceptance among
a very broad user range, as this is a crucial aspect of design
thinking teams. Wide spreads of technology and premature
knowledge and willingness to explore the digital space is
one of the difﬁculties one faces when building a weblog.
To facilitate the blog’s acceptance inside the DT com-
munity, its graphical presentation was realized along the
Corporate Design of the D-School in Potsdam. It displays
a sense of playfulness as well as an uncommon, creative
character that is well-known and closely associated with
Design Thinking. The starting page of the D- School-Blog
was therefore subdivided into ﬁve major areas:
Area ”A” is comparable to the typical header of any we-
blog, including search functionality, multi-language support,
information on why the blog was initiated and most notably
the blog’s navigational area that links to the following four
main categories:
Figure 1.
D-School Blog Starting Page - accessible via
https://d-school-blog.hpi-web.de/
• The ,Design Thinking’ category includes all kinds of
posts that generally describe the innovational process
of Design Thinking and that cannot be included in the
following more speciﬁc categories.
• ”Events” comprise postings that link Design Thinking
with speciﬁc events like the above-mentioned inno-
vation lab at the CeBIT, the presentation of the ﬁrst
Design Thinking book and others.
• ”Classes” speciﬁcally focuses on the Design projects
undertaken in the Design School of the HPI in Potsdam.
• The ”Research” category is exclusively reserved for all
work related to the bilateral Design Thinking Research
program of the HPI and the Stanford University.
Label ”B” in Figure 1 displays the featured articles in the
D-Blog. This plugin-enabled functionality adds a number of
145

features to the standard blogging software of WORDPRESS
that allow moderators to easily write and organize series
of posts and display that series dynamically in the blog.
This feature allows drawing extra attention towards a speciﬁc
event, project or topic regarding Design Thinking that is
being covered by multiple posts. In the case at hand, we
used this area within the blog to display the different Design
Challenges called out during our ”innovation Lab” at the
CeBIT in the most prominent way possible.
Any article posted in the D-blog ﬁnds its way into
the main content area labeled ”C”. Usually, the posts are
displayed in reverse chronological order, typical for weblogs.
The sidebar of the D-blog is presented in a weblog-common
way in the area labeled ”D”. Here, the blog visitors ﬁnd im-
portant Design Thinking-related links, ﬁelds for registration
and log-on, as well as a mask displaying the latest comments
posted and the most popular posts written, as well as a list
of the featured articles as also displayed in area ”B”. Here,
you also ﬁnd the list of tags assigned to the single posts, also
displayed in the ”tagcloud” at the bottom of the sidebar.
Area ”E” is the last major division of the blog’s starting
page. Since multimedia content is generated in masses
within the DT-process, a corresponding preview-gallery also
needed to be placed on the starting page. The archive with
”out-dated” posts ﬁnds its place at the very end of ”area”
E, only followed by copyright information and imprint.
Bross et al. [21] subdivide the D-School-Blog’s commu-
nity into the following user groups:
• Scientiﬁc staff, students and alumni of the D-School in
Potsdam and in Stanford,
• the editorial staff of the D-blog that was also responsi-
ble for its technical realization,
• people that are interested in the Topic of Design Think-
ing and that are willing to contributing to the process by
writing their own articles or commenting on the content
of user-groups one till three.
The diverse background of those involved in this project
obliged the editorial staff to provide technical support to
parts of the community by giving continuous support of how
to use a medium such as weblogs.
C. Proof of concept
The success of the community blogging concept is in-
dicated by the usage statistics of the D-School-Blog. The
initial pool of users consisted of students and alumni taking
part in the 24h challenge and of design thinking researchers
interested in participation at the CeBIT in 2009. A total
of 55 user accounts have been set up for the launch of
the blog, of which 39 have logged in within the ﬁrst three
days. Nearly 2 years later, the blog matured from a single-
event documentation tool to a Design Thinking community
platform that is fully integrated into the curriculum of the
D-School in Potsdam. It is also prominently linked from
the D-School’s homepage (see [33]). 140 different authors
are by now regularly publishing new posting on the weblog.
In total, the D-School-Blog so far welcomed in excess of
27.000 different users on its pages, who generated more
than 100.000 hits. We also believe that the D-School-
Blog is increasingly attracting interest in and outside the
virtual borders of Germany. Indicators for this assumption
are close to 25.000 referrers regarding the d-school-blog
from external web pages, as well as the rising number of
more than 300 followers on the accompanying twitter feed
(twitter.com/dschool potsdam). More to the point, selected
projects of the D-School that have been documented in its
blog, such as BRING.BUDDY (see [34]), have made it into
a German newspaper with a wide circulation [35] and even
into a popular German television show [36].
D. Critical success factors
Blogs may support the team building process but mean-
while need to ﬁnd acceptance among all stakeholder. This is
a tough task, due to the diverse setup that we have described
earlier on. None of the less, we believe that if the following
rules are abided, a blog should not be a source of friction.
The user should therefore be allowed
• to take an holistic view of the source data or raw
material with which they work
• to suspend judgment on any matter at any time and be
able to return to that suspended state easily
• to be able to make unplanned deviations; return to old
ideas and goals, formulate, as well as solve, problems
and
• to re-formulate the problem space as their understand-
ing of the domain or state of the problem changes.
Despite of the numerous advantages weblogs might in-
corporate for an innovative environment such as the Idea
of Design Thinking, there is a downside in their appli-
cation as well. Several experiments show, that acquiring
knowledge of others through social software (e.g. weblogs)
without personal interaction cannot fully replace the depth
of understanding of face-to-face interaction (e.g. through
non-verbal communication like mimic or gesture) [37]. We
therefore strongly support the combination of real ”physical”
networking and virtual networking in order to leverage social
software to the maximum.
Nardi et al. [38] state on this behalf that it is not what
you know - it is who you know in the modern world that
is most important in helping you getting a job or task done
satisfactorily.
In other words, social networking increases the resources
that can be leveraged through interpersonal relationships -
thus social capital [37] [39]. Scholars transcribe professional
networking with maintaining contacts, socializing, engaging
in professional activities such as attending conferences,
participating in community groups, and increasing visibility
to others [40]. It thus equally includes emailing, participating
146

in social networks such as FACEBOOK and using weblogs
in the modern era of social media [29].
V. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
Creativity is a socially deﬁned activity. As such, measures
of a creativity support tool’s success are partially dependent
on how success is deﬁned and evaluated within a speciﬁc
community of practice. Consequently, traditional measures
such as performance or efﬁciency, while still important, are
only one lens with which to view the value of a creativity
support tool. To gain a more holistic perspective of how
a tool inﬂuences the creative process, one may ﬁnd it
necessary to deﬁne new ways of measuring the impact of a
creativity support tool on the problem solving process, where
these metrics are derived from practices deemed important
by the community under investigation. The following types
of research questions that should be asked in evaluation
studies of blogs supporting design thinking teams:
• Is this technique better than existing practice (Post-Its,
Whiteboard, etc.)?
• Does it expand its use to other contexts?
• Have you learned how to improve this tool based on
this evaluation?
• How does the tool/technique inﬂuence the creative
process?
• What facets of creativity are affected and to what
degree?
• How brittle is the tool/technique?
• How accepted is it by the users over the long term?
• Does it celebrate diversity?
• How does this method complement others in the family
of tools/techniques?
• What is the task-to-technology ”ﬁt”?
VI. CONCLUSION
On top of the general advantages that weblogs might
have in a teaching or learning environment (refer to section
3.1), we identiﬁed several characteristics that are speciﬁcally
useful when deployed in the context of Design Thinking.
One crucial success factor is their ability to actively promote
and support frequent feedback and testing of their rationale.
This allows users to fundamentally change their style of
thinking and make room for speciﬁc creative processes that
are open to iteration and central for the concept of Design
Thinking. Weblogs also have the ability to pool information
that was so far unshared - another established indicator for
successful teamwork, which is the basis of what is often
described by creating something larger than the sum of the
individual input. We also argued that weblogs support the
active solidarization of the individuals into one team, follow-
ing the similarity-attraction paradigm. Next to the beneﬁt
of understanding why and how blogs can support better
design thinking teamwork results, one may also retrieve ex-
tensive process and decision documentation of rather poorly
investigated design thinking projects. Especially researchers
can proﬁt from the possibilities for convenient retrieval of
stored expertise. Additionally, the information can support
and speed up coaching and learning - new students can in
fact build on the research and ideas of others. We thus argue
that weblogs - if implemented correctly in a speciﬁc context
of application - can indeed improve the innovative process
of Design Thinking greatly.
