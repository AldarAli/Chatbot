Abstract-- The aim of this paper is to efficiently detect 
and identify the building changes from newly 
registered very high spatial resolution (VHSR) image 
by comparing with outdated map. The whole process 
is performed mainly on four steps. First, the image 
was segmented to generate primitives, which are then 
represented by a feature vector composed from 
spectral, geometric, textural and contextual attributes. 
Thereafter, tree-based ensemble methods (Bagging, 
Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees) 
are used in a classification step. The final objects' 
prediction is deducted with respect to the better 
classifier error rate. Last, a post classification change 
detection step allows to identify the segments which 
represent building changes. The data used in this 
research concerns the city of Rabat (Morocco). A 
Quickbird image has been used with an old map at the 
scale of 1:10,000. Regardless of the quality of the 
detected buildings' shape, the method achieves good 
rates of completeness and correctness.

Introduction 
Updated topographic maps are essential in many 
applications such as land and urban planning. Their 
update 
consists 
on 
visual 
interpretation 
of 
orthophotos which is time consuming and expert 
dependent. Recently, some academic studies and 
cartographic agency experiments present the update 
process as two automatic steps: (1) change 
detection and (2) map revision [1,2,3,4]. The first 
step is the most difficult [4,5]. It can be performed 
by comparing recent extracted data from a VHSR 
image with the map to be updated. An object-based 
approach is more suitable for detecting change. 
Each extracted polygon is analyzed as a whole 
allowing more interpretations of change nature. It's 
almost free data dependent, which ensures its 
transferability and let it appear as a potential 
framework for a standard solution of automatic 
change detection [5]. A typical object-based change 
detection process relies on two separate stages: (1) 
persegments-image classification and (2) post 
classification image-map comparison. First, the 
image is segmented into groups of spatially 
connected pixels with respect to some homogeneity  
 
 
criterion [6]. Resulting clumps as the unit of the rest 
of the process, are more intelligent than individual 
pixels. They could be described by other features  
than spectral ones(e.g. geometric and textural) and 
release better their contextual relationships[1]. 
Classical classifier cannot handle the high number 
of features in object-based analysis that's why 
advanced 
supervised 
learning 
classifiers 
are 
becoming more used in VHSR image classification 
[6]. These include, but are not limited to, decision 
tree (DT) and tree-based ensemble methods. They 
are a good data reduction tool and are able to detect 
multivariate interacting effects between features. 
They are also non-parametric. No assumption on 
the distribution of the data is required, it is thus 
easy to adapt for new datasets. In DT algorithm, a 
learning set is successively split into binary 
homogenous subsets based on "if-then" rule tested 
at each internal node of the tree. The terminal node 
will be labeled by the majority class.  At the end, 
the tree results in a number of class prediction rules 
that are used to create a predictive model. 
Classification accuracy from DT algorithm is often 
greater compared to using maximum likelihood or 
linear discriminate function [7]. In change detection 
context, DT have been used, for example, by 
Matikainen et al. [8] for mapping  urban building 
changes, by Ruiz et al. [1] to create and to update a 
high scale database and by Chubey et al. [9]  for 
forest inventories. 
The original classification single trees can overfit 
the training data. It's very much improved by 
ensemble methods. The tree-based ensemble 
methods rely on randomization to generate a more 
stable prediction. These methods are Bagging, 
Random Forests (RF) and Extra-Trees [10]. 
Bagging (for “Bootstrap AGGregatING”), builds 
multiple training subsets by random replacement 
from the primary learning set. Each subset is 
inducted as the classical DT algorithm explained 
above. The Bagging aggregates the predictions of 
all developed trees by a majority vote to produce 
the final class. RF combines Bagging with only a 
random selected subset of k input attributes at each 
test node. In the Extra-Trees (for “EXTremely 
RAndomized Trees”) method, each tree is build 
from the complete learning set but at each test node, 
the best split is determined by randomly selecting 
one attribute. A complete review can be found in

[10,11]. Another advantage of these algorithms is 
their internal faculty to partition learning set into 
separate sets for training and validation. This allows 
to automatically determine all their own parameters 
through cross-validation. Further details about these 
algorithms will be given thereafter. 
Our main objective in this paper is to present a 
complete 
automatic 
procedure 
for 
detecting 
changes. We limit the problem to map building 
changes which is the most dynamic class in urban 
and suburban mapping. The proposed methodology 
is based on a post classification image-map 
comparison. Tree-based ensemble methods are used 
in conjunction with an object-based image analysis. 
 The article is organized as follows: in section 2, 
study area, data and preprocessing are described. 
The whole methodology is detailed in section 3. 
Section 4 provides a discussion of the experimental 
results that validate the proposed method. Finally, 
some conclusions are drawn in section 5. 
II. 
STUDY AREA, DATA AND 
PREPROCESSING 
A. Study area and Data 
The test area is located in Rabat (Morocco) 
which is a flat relief city. It shows a new arranged 
residential district which is divided on a regular 
frame. It's composed of single-family dwellings. 
Buildings are characterized by different size, shape 
and construction material.  
Our approach was tested on a 1:10.000 scale 
map and a Quick Bird image. The map has been 
produced 
in 
1999 
from 
aerial 
photographs 
restitution by the National Cartographic Agency of 
Morocco. The satellite imagery was acquired on 
August 2004 and has a resolution of 0.61 m in 
panchromatic band and 2.4 m in the four 
multispectral ones. Considerable changes have been 
occurred between the two dates. 
B. Preprocessing 
The data pre-processing consists of two major 
steps: (1) Pan-sharpening multispectral bands by 
the panchromatic band. The four bands obtained 
have 
a 
higher 
spatial 
resolution 
than 
the 
multispectral image and they well preserve the 
spectral properties from the multispectral image. 
They will be used in feature extraction stage and (2) 
as our change detection approach is based on an 
image–map comparison, precise co-registration 
between the two data is crucial. Any miss 
registration can lead to false alarms in detecting 
change. A polynomial of first order was used; the 
obtained Root Mean Square Error (RMS) is 0.72m.  
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The proposed change detection methodology 
consists in a post classification comparison between 
a VHSR image and an outdated map. The principal 
contribution of our methodology is that it integrates 
advanced image classification within an object-
based analysis. Extracted objects are characterized 
by different attributes (spectral, geometric, textural 
and contextual). Objects in the map are used to train 
and to tune parameters in classification learning 
step. The flowchart of the whole methodology is 
represented in figure 1. All steps are explained 
thereafter.

Figure 1. Flowchart of the proposed methodology. 
A. Image segmentation 
In this work, a variant of the Watershed 
Transform (WT) [12] was developed to segment the 
panchromatic band. The WT holds its foundations 
from the mathematical morphology. The idea is to 
consider the image as a topographic surface where 
the intensity of pixel is considered as a height. 
Points with divergent flow direction are then seen 
as crests (objects' contours) which separate 
catchment basins (homogeneous regions) created 
from local minima of image (pour points). Usually 
the WT is calculated from the gradient direction. In 
this article, the study area concerns the urban 
context, where the most objects are with almost 
regular shape, e.g. roads and buildings. That's why 
a distance map computed from the catchments 
contours is used to support the WT calculation. 
In its original version, the WT produces a 
profuse number of regions. The small ones come 
from no-significant local variations of the intensity 
(false minima). This problem is more marked with 
the noisy VHSR image. To avoid this over-
segmentation, the real minima are to be imposed. 
All minima in distance map whose depth is less 
than a fixed threshold are suppressed. We select the 
threshold automatically according to dynamic range 
of the distance map. 
B. Features Extraction 
Primitives resulting from segmentation were 
characterized by 4 categories of zonal statistics. 
Spectral attributes are statistically derived (mean 
and standard deviation) from 8 spectral and 
ancillary channels including 4 pansharpened bands 
and 4 spectral indices (NDVI (Normalized 
Difference Vegetation Index), SBI (Soil Brightness 
Index), BAI (Built-Up Areas Index) and SI

(Shadow Index)) [4]. Geometric features like area, 
Elongation index and Compactness index were 
computed. Nine texture features are extracted from 
the GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) 
calculated for all pixels of a primitive, instead of for 
a regular window size [13]. In our methodology we 
propose also to take into account the location of the 
primitive. That's why for each primitive, the all 
described attributes of its 4 important neighboring 
primitives were taken as its contextual attributes. In 
total, 148 features were generated for each 
primitive. 
C. Object-based classification 
The classification consists in finding the 
thematic class of a primitive. After analyzing 
objects on existing map and available images, we 
identified 5 classes: buildings, roads, low vegetated 
areas, urban vegetation and shadow. Objects in the 
existing map are organized in three themes, 
buildings, roads and vegetation. The third layer 
includes urban vegetation (mixels tree-lawn) and 
low vegetated areas. In our change detection 
purpose we look for the large low vegetated areas 
that could have changed to build up areas. 
However, no information concerning vegetation 
type is associated to exiting vegetation objects. 
Whereas such knowledge is necessary to use map 
objects 
as 
training 
data. 
Nevertheless 
this 
information can be obtained from image data. On 
the other hand, shadow segments could not be 
trained from existing map. In order to cope with 
this, the classification is performed in a two pass 
scheme: 
(1) 
urban 
vegetation 
and 
shadow 
discrimination 
and 
(2) 
Tree-based 
ensemble 
classifications.  
First the mean value of the NDVI layer was 
used to create a binary mask. Two classes were 
defined, urban vegetation and non-urban vegetation. 
The latter class was further subdivided into shadow 
and non-shadow classes. This separation is done by 
thresholding the SI layer. Shadow segments are the 
darker in the image, so it's assumed that they have 
the lower SI value. The non-shadowed primitives 
are then classified in 3 themes: buildings, roads and 
low vegetated areas thanks to tree-based ensembles 
methods. The training samples are automatically 
selected from the old map. For every object of each 
layer in the old map, the segment that corresponds 
spatially to it is identified on the segmented image. 
The primitive is a priori retained for training if its 
geometric properties (shape and area) are close 
from those of the map object. Specific class rules 
could be added at selection stage. For example, 
having a large area is an additional criterion for 
selecting segments to train low vegetated class. 
Resulting segments attributes data were used as a 
learning set to generate tree-based ensemble 
models.  
We have decided to employ tree-based 
ensemble methods for classification for many 
reasons. 
(1) They produce multiple models which will 
feign the variability of real data. 
 (2) They have been successfully applied in a 
variety of pattern recognition and they are often 
unexcelled in accuracy among current supervised 
learning algorithm (e.g. Support Vector Machine 
[7]). 
 (3) They have been used increasingly in recent 
years in VHSR image classification and with better 
results than other classification approaches [14]. 
For 
example, 
for 
determining 
agriculture 
management practices [14], as well as for land 
use/land cover mapping change projects [15].  
Many statistical packages Pepito [16], R, S-Plus 
[14], CART [6] and Matlab [17] propose a 
complete toolbox for implementing Bagging and 
RF. The developed codes in [11] include also the 
Extra trees algorithm; they were used to implement 
our classifications. Two parameters are to fix, 
splitting criterion and stop splitting criterion. To 
split a node, a score measure is defined by 
minimizing the impurity of the output variable in 
the local subset (which also could be expressed by 
maximizing the class separation at each node). The 
GINI's index [11] is used. For the second criterion, 
It's commonly used that de development of a branch 
stops when the number of instance is lower than a 
given threshold or when impurity cannot be further 
reduced (when the output variable is constant). 
With the exception of k the number of a randomly 
selected attributes in RF which is fixed at the root 
square of the total number of attributes, all other 
parameters (number of developed trees(T) and  stop 
splitting criterion (Nmin)) were adjusting by cross 
validation from learning set according to the best 
error rate. 
D. Rules-based change detection 
Changes detection are looked for by a post-
classification comparison of the existing building 
layer with the building classification results, which 
is converted without generalization to a vector 
format. For comparison, each polygon must be 
matched with its counterpart in the other dataset. 
The obtained positional accuracy of the map and 
image is so good that matching of polygons can be 
based on their overlap. However, when defining 
rules for detection change, thresholds must be large 
enough to tolerate small errors in location and 
shape of buildings. These errors result mainly from 
(1) attributes errors propagation and (2) intrinsic 
difference in the nature of objects in both datasets 
(map and image). According to the ratio of overlap 
area (A_overlap) between a pair of buildings on the 
map(A_map) and in the building detection ( 
A_detection) result, the correspondence between 
polygons is performed. We have defined 5 classes 
for buildings change: 
New building: no building on the map 
corresponds to the detected building with: 
 
A_overlap / A_detection < Thr1   
(1) 
 
Demolished building: no building on the 
building detection corresponds to the building in 
the map with:

A_overlap / A_map< Thr1   
 (2) 
 
Confirmed existing building: building on the 
map corresponds to one in the building detection 
with: 
 
A_overlap / A_map > Thr2   
 
 (3) 
and 
A_overlap / A_detection > Thr2    
 (4) 
 
 
Enlarged building: building on the map 
corresponds to one in the building detection with: 
 
A_overlap / A_map > Thr2    
 
(5) 
and 
A_overlap / A_detection < Thr2   
(6) 
 
Re-examination needed: includes all other cases 
where none of the aforesaid conditions is verified. 
 
In our case, Thr1 is fixed to 10% in order to 
take into account the accumulated errors throughout 
the change detection process. For the second 
threshold Thr2, Rutzinger et al. [18] suggested that 
a threshold value between 50% and 70% should be 
selected for this type of comparison.  In [19], the 
authors propose to select the threshold of 80% for 
industrial areas, 70% for the apartment house areas 
and 60% for areas with smaller detached houses. 
We select Thr2= 60% because our first purpose is 
to detect all unregistered buildings without caring 
too much about the quality of their shape. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS, 
EVALUATION AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Classification 
First of all, aforesaid classification algorithms 
were evaluated. In an object-based classification 
method, the unit for classification is the object. 
Consequently, the sampling unit for validation also 
has to be an object. 99 segments selected by a 
random stratified sampling from the no learning 
data and annotated visually from the image by an 
independent interpreter were used as validation 
data. The overall accuracy, the coefficient kappa 
and its standard deviation were calculated [20]. 
Table I presents the best result obtained for each 
classifier.

As expected, the results from classical DT are 
not good what is due to the high variance of this 
method, moreover that no pruning technique was 
used. Note that the three scores of tree-based 
ensembles methods are better than the classical DT 
(14% at list). RF and Extra trees present better 
scores than Bagging with a light superiority of the 
Extra trees. The RF incorporates a features 
selection process that's why it maintains an increase 
even if with a high number of attributes. Extra trees 
builds completely random independent trees, the 
constructed model lacks sensitivity to noise and is 
not subject to overfitting, which explain the 
stability of its results (σKappa=0.02). 
For the rest of the process, the predictions from 
Extra trees will be adopted. Table II shows the error 
matrix. A good separation between "roads" and 
"buildings" is achieved. The major problem in the 
classification result is the asymmetric confusion 
between "buildings" and "low vegetated" segments, 
which is the origin of the small kappa's value. 
Adjacent segments to the buildings are mixture of 
grass, trees and asphalted surfaces; they are either 
court yards or terraces. The classification algorithm 
labels them as buildings because of their close 
spectral response to building. Moreover on the one 
hand, their area is small and on the other hand, the 
image acquisition date (August) is not suitable for 
separating low vegetated and build-up areas in 
Morocco. The classification result is shown in 
figure 2.

B. Change detection 
Applying change detection rules directly to the 
buildings class leads to an overestimation in 
changes. A series of contextual rules were then 
defined so as to optimize the building classification 
result. They are based on the fact that the building 
cast shadow in the opposite direction of the sun. 
First, for each shadow segment, its neighboring 
segments in building class with the closest azimuth 
to the sun's were selected. Once confirmed as a 
construction segments, an homogeneity analysis is 
then performed to detect the construction segments 
from their neighboring segments among the 
remaining ones in the building class. We run this 
last step iteratively until no neighboring is detected 
yet. Segments which are not selected at any 
iteration were excluded from the further process.  
To evaluate change detection results, a reference 
change map was performed by an exhaustive 
computer assisted image interpretation using the 
image and the old map as backdrops. Buildings in 
the same class in reference change map that touch 
each other in space were considered as one 
building. The concept and parameters of the change 
detection validation scheme were similar to the 
ones defined for the change detection stage. If 
there's any overlap higher than 60% between 
buildings of a pair on our change detection result 
and in the reference change map and which are 
labeled by the same class in both datasets, this is 
considered as a good detection. However, when the 
two counterpart objects are labeled separately, the 
detection is correct but with a wrong identification 
of change nature. Both automatic change detection 
result and reference change map are presented in 
figure 3, the confusion matrix of the change 
detection validation is given in table III.

The comparison of the change detection result 
of our automatic procedure with the reference 
change map shows that 46 buildings from the 49 
ones present on the area are detected so as 94% for 
completeness rate. The change nature for 45 
buildings of the detected ones is correctly identified 
so as 92% of correctness rate. Only one detected 
building has a wrong class of change. It concerns an 
unchanged existing building which is labeled as 
enlarged one by our approach. This is due to the 
segmentation step, as we merge small segments 
with their adjacent ones to overcome the over- 
segmentation problem, some segments become 
larger. Omission error is 2%, only one building is 
completely not detected (demolished). It was 
classified 
as 
a 
road 
segment. 
This 
miss-
classification is explained by the selected stopping 
criterion (Nmin=1) which forced the branch to 
continue split until only one segment per class. Two 
existing buildings were detected with smaller 
surface area than in nature, which doesn't allow 
verifying the conditions to be confirmed as existing 
buildings. Indeed, the missing parts were first 
classified as buildings, but as they are composed of 
mixed pixels (build-up areas and vegetation) they 
present 
a 
spectral 
heterogeneity 
with 
their 
neighboring which leads to their elimination by 
homogeneity post classification rules. Further 
attention is needed to this change detection class. 
Note that no false alarm was indicated. 
To have geometric information about detected 
changes, an area ratio was calculated for each

detected building. It presents the object surface area 
in reference map which is covered by the object at 
the change detection result of our automatic 
approach. The mean ratio of detected area per 
building is 85%. More geometric evaluation is 
planned in the further developments. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER 
DEVELOPMENT 
An automatic change detection process was 
proposed to map building changes. The first 
obtained results (94% for completeness and 92% 
for correctness) are promising and are comparable 
to the best results for similar researches found in 
literature (98% for completeness and 96% for 
correctness) [5]. The whole process is conceived in 
four separate stages. The basic concepts for each 
stage are chosen to be opened and generic. So that 
the minimum of adaptations will be required when 
the process is applied in a different context. 
Completeness is a decisive indicator since it is 
important to be exhaustive, to be sure not to miss 
any changes. Searching for undetected changes is 
more difficult and contrary to the basic goal of 
using automated change detection. For new 
buildings class, it's completely correctly detected 
which might lead to an operational use of our 
procedure. The result of this class could be used to 
trigger and to guide on-site inspections by the 
control authority. Unchanged existing buildings 
class represents 53% of the total number of 
buildings in the test area. This class is correctly 
detected with 85% rate. In theory, when updating 
the map, operator could bypass this class and 
concentrate on checking the changed ones. Much 
time and costs might be saved.   
Up to now, our main goal was to develop a 
complete 
automatic 
procedure 
for 
mapping 
buildings changes. Once ready, additional studies 
are underway to show if the procedure is 
transferable for other contexts. Different datasets 
with heterogeneous areas are planned to be tested. 
Practical tests are also needed to show if the results 
are 
geometrically 
accurate 
enough 
for 
an 
operational use.  
To update the old map, the changed buildings 
must integrate it. A shape adjustment step appears 
necessary 
to 
correct 
their 
contours 
before. 
Developing snakes from the detected building 
contours to create corrected ones seems to be 
attractive.
