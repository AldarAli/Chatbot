Abstract—In this paper, a new design of dual band printed 
antenna based on Minkowski fractal geometry has been 
presented. The antenna offers a very light weight, low profile, 
and very low coast, which satisfy the requirement of Low 
Earth Orbit (LEO) applications. Some techniques have been 
used to qualify the printed antenna for space applications. 
Simulation results show the advantage of Minkowski fractal 
geometry in terms of multiband and bandwidth enhancement. 
The proposed antenna operates in S and L, Ultra High 
Frequency (UHF) band efficiently, and has a small size, so it is 
useful for small satellite communication applications.   
Keywords- printed antenna;dua lband;LEO;Minkowski 
fractal geometry; multiband.   
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The modern space industry is focused on the small 
satellites manufacturing to reduce the cost of the mission. 
With this in mind, research engineers are concentrated on 
minimizing the mass and the sub-systems number on board 
satellite. The radio frequency subsystem requires the 
development of small size, low cost, lightweight, and 
compact antennas. Printed antennas are the best candidates to 
meet these requirements [1-5].    
After using the high modes of resonance, printed 
antennas have the ability to operate in two or more bands 
simultaneously 
with 
very 
similar 
performance. 
The 
advantage of this option is to minimize the total number of 
antennas on board satellite. Due to the self-similarity nature 
of their geometry, fractal is used to design the printed 
antennas to obtain the multi-band property [6]. 
For space applications, the antenna must be very reliable, 
mechanically robust, and able of supporting both random 
vibration and shock at the launch. In orbit, the antenna must 
be able to survive in the harsh radiation environment, such as 
ionizing radiation, cosmic rays, and solar energetic particles. 
Therefore, the materials of the antennas manufacturing must 
be carefully chosen [7]. 
As applications, the European Student Earth Orbiter 
(ESEO) satellite communicates at 2.080 GHz, 2.260 GHz, 
and bears a total of six microstrip antennas for command and 
telemetry.  
 
 
 
 
S-band patch antennas are used for communication by 
the commercial Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) 
micro-satellite, the antenna has a 4.9 dBi gain, main lobe 
beamwidth equal to 80°, and it has been used for command 
uplink [8].   
A dual-polarized broadband antenna array is presented in 
[9]. The operative bandwidth is from 3.15 to 3.25GHz, and 
the peak measured gain is approximately 19 dBi. The 
proposed antenna has potential applications in Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SAR), remote sensing, and wireless 
communications. 
The goal of this work is to use the Minkowski fractal 
geometry [21, 22]. to design a dual band antenna for LEO 
applications.     
In Section 2, we formulate the concept of fractal 
geometry to design the proposed antenna. In Section 3, we 
describe the geometry of the dual band printed antenna, 
principle, and procedure.  Finally, simulation results are 
shown in Section 4. 
II. 
FRACTAL GEOMETRY 
Fractals are used in several areas: statistical analysis, 
modelling nature, coding, and compression. As they can 
affect fine structures, fractals have found a good place in art 
and architecture. In the last two decades, researchers have 
used fractals in the field of electromagnetism, especially in 
the antenna design [10]. 
Fractal, meaning broken or irregular fragments, was 
originally used by Mandelbrot to describe a family of 
complex shapes that possess an inherent self-similarity or 
self-affinity in their geometrical structure.  
Generally, using fractal geometries in antennas tends to 
miniaturize their physical sizes and produce multiband 
response [11-13]. 
The first development of the antenna based on fractal 
geometry has been introduced by Cohen [14], who later 
founded the company Fractal Antennas Inc. Cohen tried to 
exploit 
the 
usefulness 
of 
different 
pre-fractal 
geometries empirically, namely Koch curves [10], the curve 
of Minkowski and Sierpinski carpet [21-22].

A. The geometry of Minkowski  
The process of generating fractal geometry is simple, 
starting with an initial geometric shape called 'initiator' or 
'generator’, the process is iterative. As a first iteration, 
each part of the initiator is replaced by a reduced form of the 
initiator, that is to say, one proceeds to a decrease of scale
[21].  
For the fractal geometry of Minkowski, from a square, a 
rectangle of dimension w1 (slot width) × w2 (indentation 
width) is cut down from the middle of the edge of each side 
of the square, the generation process of Minkowski pr
fractal geometry is shown in Fig. 1. 
Therefore, the circumference (p), increasing with the

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The particular geometry of the fractal antenna and 
electromagnetic characteristics gives self-similarity that may 
be used for obtaining the multiband fractal antenna. Due to 
their geometric complexity, it is very difficult to predict the 
required performance by using numerical methods. All these 
methods are based on solving discrete forms of Maxwell 
field equations. 
In this work, we opted for the simulator Ansoft High 
Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) 13.0. The technique 
used by the software is based on the finite element method. 
Ansoft HFSS can be used to calculate parameters, such as S- 
Parameters, Resonant Frequency and Fields. Apart from the 
normal view design, it provides a 3D view, which is an 
added advantage. 
To investigate the effect of the fractal geometry on the 
multiplicity of bands, we represent in each case: 
• 
The return loss by taking the maximum value equal 
to -10 dB. 
• 
The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) to 
determine the operating frequency taking the 
maximum value of less than 2 dB. 
 
Fig. 3 shows the variations of the return loss (S11) and 
the VSWR of the first iteration Minkowski fractal antenna 
versus frequency.  It is noted that the antenna operates in two 
different frequencies. For VSWR<2, the first frequency is 
f1=2.0602 GHz corresponds to VSWR1=0.4397, and the 
second frequency is f2=3.4135 GHz corresponds to 
VSWR2=0.323. 
The radiation pattern of the first iteration Minkowski 
fractal antenna, for the two angles phi=0° and phi=90°, is 
shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that, for the two plans of the 
electric field E (phi=0°) and the magnetic field H (phi=90°), 
the antenna aperture is about 60°, which gives a quasi-
hemispherical radiation pattern.

first iteration Minkowski fractal antenna 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.   Radiation pattern of the first iteration Minkowski pre-fractal 
antenna. 
Fig. 5 shows the 3D gain variation pattern of the first 
iteration Minkowski antenna. It is noticed that the maximum 
gain of the antenna is Gmax=7.357dB in the Z axis direction 
(phi=0°). 
The return loss (S11) of the two Minkowski antennas for 
the first and the second iteration are presented in Fig. 6. For | 
S11 | < -10 dB, the second iteration Minkowski antenna 
operates for four frequencies in two bands: L band for the 
frequency f1 = 1.8722 GHz: | S11 | = -20 dB, and S band for 
f2 = 2.2632 GHz: | S11 | = -13.36 dB, f3 = 2.4962 GHz:          
| S11 | = -24.35 dB, and f4=2.9323 GHz: | S11 | = -20.26 dB.

Figure 6.  S11 of the first and the second iteration Minkowski fractal 
antennas 
By comparison with the first iteration Minkowski 
antenna, we notice the appearance of two new frequencies. 
For the condition VSWR<2, the frequency f2 = 2.2632 
GHz (VSWR2=3.78) does not present a resonance 
frequency, we can thus conclude that the second iteration 
Minkowski antenna presents three resonances frequencies 
(Fig. 7). 
Fig. 8 represents the model of the third iteration 
Minkowski fractal antenna using HFSS (the relative axis is 
tilted by 45° compared to the principal axis). 
However, the gain decreases when the iteration number 
increases. This is justified by the increasing of the antenna 
input impedance, which leads to antenna and microstrip line 
mismatch.     
The radiation pattern of three iterations for phi=90° and 
phi=0°, is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, respectively.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a new structure of printed antenna based on 
the Minkowski fractal geometry has been presented. The 
suggested structure is made up of two layers of substrate and 
a parasitic element of patch in order to increase the gain.      
A separation by layers of airs is done to increase the antenna 
bandwidth.  
A fractal geometry study effect on the printed antennas is 
done; a comparative study was drawn up to conclude that the 
use of fractal geometry has several advantages, such as the 
multiplicity of band, and the increase in the antenna 
bandwidth. 
The proposed antenna is characterized by reduced size, 
low cost, low profile, and rigid structure.  
The third iteration Minkowski pre-fractal antenna 
operates in S and L bands, presents a moderate gain, and a 
quasi-hemispherical radiation pattern. This antenna can be 
used in telemetry, tracking, and control for satellite Earth 
observation.   
Finally, we may conclude that the space parameters and 
structural of the antenna are very affected on the RF 
performance of the printed antenna. The advantage of the 
fractal geometry is the property multi-band, but this is 
limited by the structural performance of the antenna, and 
then by the form of the radiating element. 
As future work, we can extend this work to VHF/UHF 
bands, a large number of potential applications arise. The 
low input resistance for the antenna using fractal geometry 
can be improved by feeding the antenna suitably. The 
suggested antenna presented in this work needs an 
optimization algorithm for radiation study.
