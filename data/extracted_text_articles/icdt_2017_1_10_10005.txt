Abstract—Operators are building architectures and systems
for delivering voice, audio, and data services at the required
speed for now and in the future. For ﬁxed access networks,
this means in many countries a shift from copper based to
ﬁbre based access networks. This paper proposes a method to
optimise the migration path, heterogeneously per central ofﬁce
area, using geometric models as input. The method results in
a detailed migration path that meets a required bandwidth
coverage. For this, two models are presented. The ﬁrst minimises
the total costs meeting a bandwidth requirement per period, the
second minimises the deviation from this bandwidth requirement
meeting a budget constraint per period. While the data used for
the migration path optimisation is in practice hard to gather, the
use of geometric modelling is proposed. This modelling approach
can estimate the total CapEx of a migration step using only two
simple parameters per Central Ofﬁce area.

I. INTRODUCTION
Broadband internet is becoming a common utility service.
Using connected electronic devices in and outside our homes,
we use more and more data and demand connectivity 24/7.
The used services are asking more bandwidth due to the
integration of video into numerous services. Most of the
home connections, access networks and systems, of telecom
operators are not prepared to offer this, where incumbent oper-
ators mostly use copper telecommunication networks offering
ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) or VDSL (Very
High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) techniques as service.
Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a family of technologies, used
to transmit digital data over copper lines. The operators have
to make the costly step to Fibre to the Cabinet (FttCab), Fibre
to the Curb (FttCurb) or, even more costly, the full step to
Fibre to the Home (FttH), Fibre near the home (FntH) or
Fibre to the Air (FttA). An example of FntH and FttA is a
wireless home connection or a Hybrid ﬁbre-wireless (FiWi)
access network, where ﬁbre is brought to a location near the
homes, e.g., street lights [1], and the remaining distance is
covered by WiFi or WiMax [2] [3]. However, the roll out of
all these ﬁbre connections will be taking in many countries
too long to compete with the cable TV operators, active in
those countries, who can offer the required bandwidth using
DOCSIS, Data Over Cable Service Interface Speciﬁcation. on
their Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) networks at this moment.
This urges the operators to take intermediate steps, such as
FttCurb, and to think about the optimal migration strategy.
The incumbent telecom operators can choose between various
topology types to offer. In this paper, the term ’topology’
is used for the way the physical ﬁbres and equipment are
designed. It comprises the question where to deploy ﬁbres,
where to deploy copper, where is the active or passive equip-
ment placed. Each topology can run multiple technologies. For
example, in the ’Full Copper’ topology the operator offers
the services from the Central Ofﬁce. The operator still can
choose to offer ADSL or VDSL (containing here all VDSL
based technologies such as VDSL, VDSL2, Vectored VDSL2,
Vplus etcetera) technology for this service. In this paper, four
topology types are distinguished (see Fig. 1):
1) Full Copper: services are offered from the Central Ofﬁce
(CO) over a copper (twisted pair) cable, using DSL
techniques.
2) Fibre to the Cabinet (FttCab): the ﬁbre connection is
extended to the cabinet. From the cabinet the services
are offered over the copper cable, using DSL or G.Fast
techniques.
3) Hybrid Fibre to the Home (Hybrid FttH): services are
offered from a Hybrid FttH Node, which is connected
by ﬁbre, close to the customer premises, in the street or
in the building. Here again VDSL and G.Fast techniques
can be offered.
4) Full Fibre to the Home (Full FttH): the ﬁbre connection
is brought up to the customer premises.
If the operator starts with a Full Copper topology in a
certain area, he has to decide on the next step: bringing
the ﬁbre connection all the way to the customers or use an
intermediate step, where he brings the ﬁbre closer to the
customer, e.g., FttCab. Note that the operator can have a
heterogeneous network, where in different areas a different
topology is deployed and a different starting position for
migration is found. To make in a certain area the decision
mentioned before, the operator has to look at the pros and
cons of all the options. For example, the deployment of FttCab
can be much faster than Full FttH, as it requires less digging,
the last part of the connection from the street to the access

node in the house does not have to be installed, and it meets
the growing bandwidth demand for now and the near future.
If, in future, this demand exceeds the supplied bandwidth, the
remaining part to the residence can be connected with Full
Fibre or using Hybrid Fibre as extra intermediate step. If the
demand does not exceed the supplied bandwidth, for example
it reaches some level of saturation, no further migration is
needed, saving a lot of investments. However, when Full FttH
is the expected ﬁnal solution, using intermediate steps would
incur investment and installation costs that might be lost and
not reused.
This decision can be made on strategic level, for a bigger
region or a whole country, or more tactical/operational within
a region. In this paper, the option that the operator can decide
per Central Ofﬁce area which topology or technology to offer
is regarded. This means that the operator is offering broadband
as a service, instead of offering for example FttH as a service.
If an operator decides on the topology or technique per Central
Ofﬁce area and per period (e.g., year), he can develop a
detailed migration path that meets, for example, a bandwidth
coverage in a larger area. This option is called a heterogeneous
optimal migration path in contrast to a homogeneous optimal
migration path, where one migration path is used for all
Central Ofﬁce areas within the bigger region. This is the
ﬁrst part where the novelty of this paper is in. Up to now,
other papers only considered uniform migration paths or single
migration paths.
The second part where this paper is novel, is the data used
for the migration path optimisation. To estimate the costs of
a topology and the migration from one topology to another
topology, for each migration an optimal planning should be
made. We propose to solve this by using the geometric
modelling, as presented in [4] [5].
Concluding, in this paper, we present a methodology that
can be used by operators to design their heterogeneous topol-
ogy migration path from Full Copper to Full FttH, meeting
their business requirements. First we start with a literature
survey on related models. In Section III, a model is presented
to optimise the heterogeneous migration paths. In Section IV,
a method is presented to gather to input for the migration
path optimisation using Geometric models. In Section V, the
optimisation method is demonstrated by a case study. Finally,
in Section VI, some conclusions are presented.
II. LITERATURE
Migration within telecommunication network is a topic in
many Techno-Economical studies. In these studies the eco-
nomic sanity of some choices are investigated. The European
projects IST-TONIC [6] and CELTIC-ECOSYS [7] resulted
in various upgrade or deployment scenarios for both ﬁxed
and wireless telecommunication networks, published in [8]
and [9]. A major question in these studies is when to make
the decision to roll out a FttC/VDSL network or a Full FttH
network. Based on demand forecasts, it was shown that it is
proﬁtable to start in dense urban areas, wait for ﬁve years
and then decide to expand it to the urban areas. With the use
of real option valuation the effect of waiting is rewarded to
identify the optimal decision over time. In [10] [11] the OASE
approaches are presented for more in depth analysis of the FttH
total cost of ownership (TCO) and for comparing different
possible business models both qualitatively and quantitatively.
The work of Casier [12] presents the techno-economic aspects
of a ﬁbre to the home network deployment. First he looks at
all aspects of a semi-urban roll-out in terms of dimensioning
and cost estimation models. Next, the effects of competition
are introduced into the analysis. The work in [13] presents a
multi-criteria model aimed at studying the evolution scenarios
to deploy new supporting technologies in the access network to
deliver broadband services to individuals and small enterprises.
This model is based on a state transition diagram, whose nodes
characterise a subscriber line in terms of service offerings
and supporting technologies. This model was extended for
studying the evolution towards broadband services and create
the optimal path for broadband network migration. A similar
kind of model is presented in [14] [15], where also an
optimal strategy is proposed using a dynamic migration model.
They study the best migration path including CAPEX, OPEX
and revenues. Several ﬁxed access technologies are taken as
multiple intermediate steps. A more recent study [16] proposes
several migration strategies for active optical networking from
the data plane, topology, and control plane perspectives, and
investigates their impact on the total cost of ownership but
does not optimise.
Finally, our own previous work was about the beneﬁts of
a migration path as alternative for the direct step from Full
Copper to FttH [17] and a Techno-Economic model [18]
that can calculate the effect of offering different topologies
and technologies in access networks (in migration) on market
share, revenues, costs and earnings.
As said earlier, all these approaches (if optimising) only
consider uniform or single migration paths and do not include
the possibility of using geometric models as input.

ogy/technique, possibly using other topology/technique com-
bination as intermediate steps. Analogue to [14] we use a
ﬁgure to clarify the idea, see Fig. 2. Each node here is a
topology/technique combination. One can choose a path from
node 1, typically Full Copper/ADSL, to node S, typically FttH.
So examples for the paths are: Full Copper/ADSL to FttH, Full
Copper/ADSL to FttCab/VDSL to FttH, Full Copper/ADSL
to FttCab/VDSL to FttCurb/G.Fast, etcetera. The focus in this
paper is on an area that consists of multiple Central Ofﬁces,
which is the location of the switching equipment, to which
subscriber home and business lines are connected on a local
loop, for example a city or a district. The goal of the operator
is to offer in this district a certain bandwidth coverage (per
year), given a budget (per year) and possibly other constraints.
A bandwidth coverage can be a single value, e.g., ’I want
to offer 100 Mb/s in 2017’, or a distribution over various
bandwidth values in a number of years. An example of this
distribution over years is presented in Table I. In the table is
stated that in 2018 (at least) 60% of the houses need to have
(at least) 100 Mb/s, at least 40% of the houses need to have (at
least) 200 Mb/s and (at least) 10% need (at least) 300Mb. The
percentages do not add up to 100% while they are exceedance
probabilities. If all houses have a connection that offers 500
Mb/s the bandwidth coverage demand is met, obviously.

This model will be called the base model. In (1) the total
investment cost (CapEx) is minimised. In (2) it is made certain
that there is not more than 1 migration step per year per
location. Equation (3) makes sure that each location has each
year exactly 1 topology. Equation (4) creates the migration
steps. The right term can only be greater than zero if (and only
if) (yjlt−yjlt−1) = 1 and (yilt−yilt−1) = −1, which indicates
that there is a transition from technology i to technology j. In
(5) the demanded bandwidth coverage is required.
An alternative objective function is realised when adding the
operational cost, or OpEx. This alters the objective function

IV. INPUT FROM GEOMETRIC MODEL
In the previous section two parameters are used, that are
not that easy to get, namely cijl, the cost for migration from i
to j on location l, and Rild, the number of premises reached
by i within d meter on location l. To get the value of these
parameters, for each migration an optimal planning should
be made. We introduce an alternative for this problem by
using the outcomes of geometric modelling, as presented in
[4] [5]. This means that we start by a simple set of parameters
per (currently) active node: the total cable length (D) and
the capacity of this node (n), which equals the number of
premises connected. As is shown in [5] from these parameters
the geometric density of the premises can be derived. With this
geometric density we can estimate the number of new active
locations that a next technology needs in this area to achieve
a certain distance coverage and, consequently, the bandwidth
coverage. From this number of active elements the costs of the
migration can be estimated. Next, using the same density also
the cable and digging distances to connect those new active
elements can be estimated.
To illustrate this approach, think of an area, currently
equipped with VDSL2, that contains n1 = 1, 000 houses.
The given total cable length equals D1 = 875, 000 meter.
Now, the parameter d, which indicates the house density of
the area, expressed in the (average) width of the premises,
can be derived by solving (using s1 = √n1):
d =
D1
2 · s1 · ⌈ 1
2s1⌉ · ⌊ 1
2s1⌋.
(12)
Resulting in dD
= 57, 7 for the given example. Let us
assume that in the next topology, let us assume V-plus, we
want to reach 85% within 400 meters. From [4] we know
the probability distribution of the individual distances of the
houses to the active node: it can be estimated by a Normal
distribution Fµ,σ(x) with µ2 = D2
n2 and σ2 = M−µ
2
where M2
represents the maximum cable distance in the second topology
using [5]:
M = 2 · ⌈1
2s2 − 1⌉ · d + 0.5d,
(13)
s2 = √n2,
(14)
and the total cable length in the second topology
D2 = 2 · d · s2 · ⌈1
2s2⌉ · ⌊1
2s2⌋.
(15)
Now,
the
question
is
to
choose
n2
such
that
Fµ(n2),σ(n2)(300) = 0.90. This can be solved numerically
and leads to the following values n2 = 100, M2 = 490,
D2 = 28800, µ2 = 290 and σ2 = 100. This means that to
meet this requirement of 85% within 400 meter, 10 new
nodes should be installed. It takes 28800 meter of digging
and (ﬁbre) cable to connect these nodes.
V. CASE STUDY
In this section a case study is presented introducing a
small city with 40 cabinets and 18,500 houses. The current
employment is ADSL. The operator has a bandwidth coverage
goal, expressed in percentage of the houses that is within a
certain distance from the active equipment. The coverage goal
is shown in Table III. For example, the goal is to have 70%
of the houses within 400 meter in 2021.

Two cases are distinguished. In the ﬁrst case the operator
tries to meet the distance requirement for each year indepen-
dently and optimally. This means that the operator optimises
the design of each area without knowledge of future networks,
topologies and technologies. In the second case the operator
tries to meet the requirements for the total time horizon, using
the methodology of Section III. For each cabinet, for each 3-
year period, the operator can chose between doing nothing,
implementing VDSL and implementing V-plus, each with its
own costs and bandwidth consequences. Now, the operator
tries to make the decisions such that the total migration costs
are minimal, meeting the distance coverage requirements for
each period as modelled in the base model of Section III. The
used costs for digging and equipment are based on the (Sub-
Urban) numbers of [19].
The result of the optimisation (only using Excel and
OpenSolver [20]) of the two cases is depicted in Table IV
for the per-period optimisation and Table V for the overall

optimisation. In the per-period optimisation in the ﬁrst year
(2018) more VDSL is chosen, as this is a cheaper solution to
meet the 2018 requirements. In the overall optimisation the
more expensive choice for V-plus is made, as this is more
ready for the future. In the other two stages more or less the
same choices are made. This leads to the total overview of
costs as depicted in Fig. 3, where the total costs of the overall
optimisation are lower, but the costs in the ﬁrst year are higher.
All costs are expressed in Net Present Value, with an average
cost of capital of 6%, making the values in the various years
comparable.
Figure 3. Investment costs.
Figure 4. Meeting the bandwidth demand in the alternative model.
If the alternative model is used with a maximum budget of
750,000 euro per period, the results are as depicted in Fig. 4.
In the ﬁrst two year the bandwidth demand cannot be met,
with a cumulative difference of 32% for the both approaches.
This means that the sum of the differences between the number
of houses reached within a certain distance and the requested
percentage for all distances in a certain year equals 32%. In the
second time period there also is almost no difference (0.7%),
but in the third period, the small differences in the ﬁrst two
periods pay off, by a big difference in realisation (6.9% versus
11.3%). This means that the overall optimisation realised a
plus on coverage of more than 4%.

The result of the optimisation of the two cases is depicted in
Table VI for the per-period optimisation and Table VII for the
overall optimisation. What can be seen in this example is that
the alternative model over-compensates the under performance
in the ﬁrst two periods by over performance in the last period.
This can be prevented by an other choice of objective in this
model (Eq. 7), such as

Equation 16 is the best in preventing this phenomenon, while
compensating is not possible: the negative terms are set to
zero. Equation 17 tries to get results close to zero, preventing
big deviations. Both alternatives will result in a model that
is harder to solve than before by introducing a non-linear
objective.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a methodology that can be used
by operators to design their heterogeneous topology migration
path from Full Copper to (Full) FttH, meeting their business
requirements. Heterogeneous means that the operator decides
per Central Ofﬁce area the topology or technique per period
(e.g., year), resulting in a detailed migration path that meets
a required bandwidth coverage in the larger area. For this,
two models were presented. The ﬁrst minimised the total
investment (CapEx) and operational costs (OpEx), such that
the bandwidth requirement per period was met. The second
minimised the deviation from this bandwidth requirement
meeting a budget constraint per period.
The data used for the migration path optimisation is in prac-
tice hard to gather. For this, the use of geometric modelling
was proposed, with which the total CapEx of a migration step
can be estimated using only two parameters per Central Ofﬁce
area, the total existing cable length and the capacity of this
node.
Finally, the two models were demonstrated in two case
studies that showed the gain that can be realised by the
migration path optimisation.
