Abstract—Sample bit modification for data embedding on a 
cover audio signal has been shown as a viable technique for 
steganography and watermarking. Depending on the sample 
bit index chosen for carrying the embedded data, there is a 
tradeoff between viability of the data in the presence of noise, 
robustness and imperceptibility.  Although a high threshold of 
audio samples can carry data at higher bit indices thereby 
raising robustness, it can be susceptible to noise even at low 
levels and, with sample amplitudes changed significantly, 
embedding becomes conspicuous, both detrimental for covert 
or secure communication.  In this paper, modification of the 
high threshold sample embedding is shown to increase noise 
immunity with correct data retrieval at a lower payload, but 
without sacrificing indiscernibility.  Experimental results using 
a noise-free utterance (from a corpus of read speech) and a 
noisy utterance (between air traffic controllers and pilots) 
show zero to low bit error rate of hidden data recovery at 
added noise levels of 50 decibels of signal-to-noise ratio. 
Keywords— Audio steganography; data embedding; bit 
modification; perceptual quality measure; noise robustness;

 INTRODUCTION 
Secure and covert communication using unsecured 
network relies on steganographic techniques employing 
audio, image and video as host or cover carriers.  
Applications of such secure communication abound in 
battlefield data transmission and civilian transmission of 
banking, medical and employment data, to name a few.  
Steganography in general, and audio steganography more 
specifically, can supplement and enhance encrypted digital 
data for added security and privacy. 
While the challenge of meeting all the key criteria of 
high payload, low or no perceptibility of embedding and 
high data integrity in the presence of noise is hard, 
applications with different requirements can readily be 
satisfied with tradeoff in one or more criteria.  Watermarking 
of 
speech 
for 
copyright 
protection 
or 
authenticity 
verification, for example, may not need as much payload as 
for transmitting confidential medical data.  Additionally, 
music copyright and/or transmission requires high level of 
indiscernibility.  Covert communication may need to carry a 
reasonably high volume of information with little 
noticeability of the presence of embedding.  Efficacy of 
techniques of data hiding can, therefore, be different with 
varying degrees of fulfilling the criteria.  Additionally, use of 
the original host, or cover, audio signal for retrieving the 
embedded information may not be a limitation in 
watermarking applications; for covert communication, 
however, this type of escrow detection of hidden data may be 
an impediment requiring the use of the same host signal at 
the receiver and transmitter.  It also may cause suspicion 
about the audio signal hiding information.  Oblivious 
retrieval, on the other hand, needs some property of the host 
signal to remain the same in the stego, or data-embedded 
signal.  A generally used invariant property is the 
psychoacoustic masking phenomenon of the human auditory 
system that renders spectral changes in an audio signal that 
are below its global masking threshold imperceptible.  If the 
embedding procedure leaves the resulting spectral changes 
below 
the 
masking 
threshold, 
the 
stego 
becomes 
indiscernible from the host.  In addition, the same masking 
threshold can be used at the receiver to retrieve the 
embedded data.  Based on these key advantages, a number of 
techniques have been developed for audio steganography 
with oblivious detection [1]-[4]. 
The paper is organized as follows.  Section II provides a 
brief review of audio sample bit modification for embedding.  
In Section III the proposed bit modification technique is 
described.  Experimental results observed and a discussion of 
these results are given in Section IV.  Conclusions drawn 
from the work form Section V.

AUDIO STEGANOGRAPHY EMPLOYING TIME DOMAIN 
SAMPLE BIT MODIFICATION 
An alternative to hiding data in the spectral domain of 
host audio that exploits the auditory masking property of 
human perception is to alter time-domain samples in 
according with the data.  Time-domain sample modification 
maintains imperceptibility if small changes are made to a 
few samples that are in the neighborhood of relatively large 
samples, for example.  An early sample modification 
technique replaced the least significant bit (lsb) of each of a 
selected set of host audio samples with the data to be 
embedded.  Such a simple technique, clearly, is susceptible 
to loss of data due to noise and also to illegal removal or 
replacement of the lsb.  Several higher order bit modification 
techniques carry data on samples that are large enough but at 
bit indices that contribute to relatively small changes so that 
audibility of embedding is reduced.  While lower bit indices 
generally cause less noticeability of embedding with higher

payload, it is also more susceptible to noise [5]-[7].  In this 
paper, we report an imperceptible bit modification 
steganography that can recover hidden data in the presence 
of noise on the stego. 
III. 
SAMPLE BIT MODIFICATION AT SIGNIFICANT SAMPLES 
Employing high bit indices for carrying hidden data can 
alleviate noticeability of modification if the samples are 
large in amplitude and the modified bit is relatively small.  
While this may reduce payload for a given host audio – due 
to non-availability of a large number of high amplitude 
samples – it can help mask auditory perception and 
contribute to higher noise robustness.  With this premise, 
the following bit modification procedure was carried out on 
a noise-free and a noisy audio signal, as an extension to 
previously reported bit modification steganography [8]. 
Samples of a given host audio signal are selected for 
carrying hidden data based on a threshold M, where

, so that only amplitudes a that satisfy 
a
 M
 are used for modification.  For a 16-bit audio with 
full dynamic range, a typical threshold can use l1 = 10, l2 = 
11 and l3 = 12 (with LSB at index 1) so that M = 3584; 
hence, only samples with magnitudes of at least 3584 are 
considered potential samples available for bit modification. 
To reduce the significance of change due to one of the 16 
bits modified in the set {S}, sample bit k < l1, the smallest 
index used for the threshold,  is used for modification in 
accordance with data to be hidden if 2k
r
M  . 
 This criterion ensures that the modified sample is 
different from the original host audio by no more than 100r 
%.  By a choice of r, this empirical rule can result in minimal 
changes in stego while affording different higher order bit 
indices for embedding in larger sample values.  Although a 
large bit index k may raise data robustness to noise, it can 
also cause noticeable change in spectrogram and audibility, 
both resulting in conspicuousness of embedding.  A 
reasonable choice for the index k is, therefore, below the 
lowest threshold bit index l1, in general.  Test results are 
shown in the following section for different values of k. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The first test used a noise-free utterance (from the corpus 
of phonemically and lexically transcribed speech of 
American English speakers) available at a sampling rate of 
16000 Hz.  Using a threshold of M = 3584, i.e., with l1 = 10, 
l2 = 11 and l3 = 12, effect of modifying different bit indices 
of samples satisfying the threshold was studied for different 
levels of noise added to the stego.  The host audio was 
windowed into 320 samples (20 ms) of non-overlapping 
segments.  Only those segments that had a significant 
number of potential amplitudes (at least 10) were considered 
for carrying hidden data.  To increase data robustness in the 
presence of noise, if a frame had at least 10 potential 
samples, each of these samples was modified at its kth bit 
with the same single bit of data (or, data bit exclusive-ORed 
with a key) to be embedded.  By using a majority of the 10 
(or more) recovered bits, probability of correct bit recovery 
was increased at the cost of reduced payload.  As an 
example, Figure 1 shows the spectrograms of the original 
(host) audio and the stego carrying 71 bits of data in each of 
the 71 frames.  The host with 51544 samples had 161 frames 
with 71 frames having 10 or more samples that were larger 
than the threshold of M = 3584.  Each of the first 10 
significant samples in a frame was modified at its 7th bit (lsb 
= 1) with the same data bit.  The data bit index value 
corresponded to the embedded frame index – frame 16 that 
satisfied both the threshold and the number of samples, for 
example, carried data bit 16 in all of its 10 or more samples. 
Thus, with 71 frames of the host audio, the stego carried 710 
bits with 71 bits of data.   
Figure 1.  Spectrograms of original (noise-free) host (top) and stego 
carrying 71x10 bits at sample index 7 (lsb = 1) 
Retrieval of the data bits was carried out by first 
segmenting the stego audio into samples of 320 and 
determining those samples that were above the threshold of 
3584 in magnitude.  If a segment had at least 10 such 
samples, then the kth bit of each of the first 10 of these 
samples was obtained (with the same key as the one used for 
embedding).  A majority of the 10 recovered bits was 
considered the correct embedded bit.  With this procedure, 
all of the 71 embedded bits were correctly recovered. 
To study the robustness of data with noise, zero-mean 
Gaussian noise at various levels of signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) was added to the stego.  Data-retrieval from the 
noise-added stego was proceeded in the same manner as 
above.  If the level of noise was such that the threshold was 
unaffected, the samples in which a bit in each was 
embedded remained the same; the noise, however, could 
have affected the kth bit in some cases.  By a majority voting 
of the recovered bits from the first 10 samples of each 
embedded frame, error due to noise was reduced.  Figure 2 
shows the original host audio and the noise-added stego at 
50 dB of SNR.  With majority voting, all 71 bits embedded 
in the stego were correctly recovered.

As the noise level was increased, either more samples 
were affected at the kth bit of embedded samples, or worse, 
the noise altered the embedded samples so that threshold was 
not satisfied at the same frames as those used for embedding; 
both cases led to errors in data retrieval.  Changing the bit 
index k for sample modification of the host, similarly, caused 
errors with lower levels of noise as k was decreased.  Table I 
shows the data bit error rate (BER) as a function of modified 
bit index k and SNR.  Each row corresponds to the maximum 
SNR for the kth bit used for embedding.  As the bit index k 
was reduced, noise tolerance became smaller and BER 
increased, although a BER of zero was achieved for the stego 
without any noise.

All cases correspond to the same threshold of 3584 and 
71 bits of data with each bit repeated 10 times in a frame 
with 10 or more samples above the threshold. 
In the second test, a noisy audio was used as a practical 
example of host to carry hidden information.  This audio 
from the Greenflag database of communication between 
fighter aircraft pilots and their air traffic controllers has 
80150 samples obtained at the rate of 8000 per second.  With 
160 samples (20 ms) per frame, there were 500 frames and 
302 of these frames satisfied the same threshold of 3584 with 
20 or more samples.  Choosing to repeat the same bit 20 
times (the first 20 in each embeddable frame), all 302 bits 
were recovered from the total of 6040 bits.  Correct data 
recovery was also achieved with noise at 50 dB SNR added 
to the stego.  Figure 3 shows the spectrograms of the original 
host audio and the noise-added stego audio carrying data at 
sample bit index 7.  At higher levels of noise, BER started to 
show up.  Similar results were observed for embedding 
indices of 8 and 9, again with noise added at 50 dB or higher 
SNR. 
Figure 3.  Spectrograms of host (noisy) audio (top) and noise-added stego 
carrying 302x20 bits at sample index 7 
When the repetition rate of embedding the same bit in a 
frame was reduced to 10, there were 335 frames available for 
a data payload of 335 bits.  At this slightly increased 
payload, one to three bits were incorrectly recovered at the 
noise level of 50 dB for a BER of 0.2985 to 0.8955, while no 
error resulted in the absence of added noise.  This shows that 
the majority voting contributes to correct data recovery when 
noise is present in the stego.  Similar results were observed at 
other indices for k, with BER increasing with noise level at 
lower indices. 
From the two examples of audio considered, we may 
observe that a noise-free host audio is likely to have fewer 
samples satisfying a large threshold; payload, consequently, 
is reduced.  A more realistic host audio with ambient and 
other type of noise, on the other hand, may have a high 
number of samples that can be modified with data without 
causing any perceptual or other difference. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
An improved audio steganography employing time-
domain sample bit modification at high bit indices has been 
proposed.  Results observed on a clean and a noisy host 
audio signal show the viability of the technique in 
imperceptible embedding, and oblivious and error-free 
retrieval of the embedded data.  By using a higher bit index 
of selected samples, and with a majority voting, hidden data 
bits can be correctly extracted even in the presence of added 
noise.  The tradeoff for robust data recovery is low payload.  
The proposed method may be suitable for covert

imperceptibility of embedding, audio watermarking and
