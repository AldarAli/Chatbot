Abstract—The green IT (information technology) issue is one of 
the important issues on the network department recently.  
Because the wireless access point has an amount of portion of 
network power consumption,  reducing cell size is introduced 
to save the wireless network power consumption. In this paper, 
we investigate the effects of cell size in terms of total base 
station power consumption, handover rate, user density, and 
outage probability. Finally, as reducing the cell size, total 
power consumption and outage probability are decreased. 
However, the handover rate increase and the number of user 
in a cell decrease. Since, the multicast transmission scheme is 
good solution to reduce the bandwidth and delivering the same 
contents to user, we investigate the energy resource 
performance based on the multicast transmission system. 
Finally, these analyses can be helpful for energy efficient cell 
planning.

 INTRODUCTION  
Over the last 5 years, the green IT issue is one of the 
most important issues on the electrical engineering 
department. During this period, many researches focused on 
reducing the power consumption. Moreover, it is also 
important issues to save energy and reduce the power 
consumption at network equipment. Especially for network 
department, wireless access point is the most important issue 
of green network because it has 40% of total power 
consumption at the access point in wireless networks [1]. 
Therefore, 
some 
technical issues 
such as 
network 
architecture, cell size, routing, etc., are researched to reduce 
energy consumption of the wireless access point [1]. 
Since the wireless access technology has been 
developed quickly and the number of users who requests 
various multimedia broadcasting and streaming such as 
IPTV increases, it is important to allocate resource 
efficiently [2]. To support quality of service (QoS) of users, 
wireless multicast transmission can be a good solution to 
reduce the resource waste for delivering the same contents to 
user. However, there is lack of consideration in energy 
efficiency of multicast transmission scheme, since it is just 
focused on some resource such as bandwidth, delay, capacity 
and so on. Therefore, we investigate the energy resource 
considering multicast transmission system. Moreover, Cell 
planning is main problem in the 
cellular mobile 
communication and also it is the key of reducing power 
consumption of base station. Previous cell planning 
technology for energy saving is focused on small-sized cell 
which has advantage of reducing base station power 
consumption [3].  
In this paper, we focus on the cell planning technology 
for reducing the power consumption especially in wireless 
multicast environments. In detail, we analyze the base station 
power consumption and handover rates as varying the cell 
size. Moreover, we also analyze the multicast outage 
probability versus cell size. It is energy efficient way on 
behalf of the base station power consumption. However, a 
small-sized cell topology makes smaller coverage area and 
more frequent handover. The more handover causes latency 
and additional unnecessary power consumption. In addition, 
small-sized cell makes that the number of users per one base 
station is reduced. Therefore, our analysis shows the effects 
of cell size on total power consumption, handover, the 
number of user per base station, outage probability in this 
paper. This analysis can be efficient tool for cell planning by 
considering various points of view.  
Moreover considering mobility, S.K. Lee et al. [4] 
already investigated the wireless access network based on 
WDM-PON for mobility support. They optimize the 
mobility management process between the corresponding 
node and the home agent. From their results, bandwidth 
waste and long end-to-end packet delay are reduced using 
their proposed scheme. However, power consumption and 
cell radius are not considered in their proposed scheme.   
The remainder of the paper is organized as follow. 
Section Ⅱ briefly explains the related works. Section Ⅲ 
introduces the system model and performance. Section Ⅳ 
concludes the paper.  Last, we present the future work which 
is to find the optimal solution in section Ⅴ.

RELATED WORKS 
A. Cell size 
Previous study, I. Hakki CAVDAR et al. [5] proposed an 
algorithm 
for 
the 
TDMA-FDMA 
mobile 
cellular 
communication system. They consider traffic and coverage 
analysis for procedure of cell planning. As the cell radius 
increases, transmitted power of base station (BS) and path 
loss are increased, however the capacity has better 
performance. They also consider three environment, urban

area, suburban area, and rural area. In case of the urban 
environment, performance is worse than suburban and rural 
environment. Jayant Baliga et al. [6] present a comparison of 
energy consumption of access networks which are passive 
optical networks, fiber to the node, point-to-point optical 
systems and WiMAX. Their results show that the optical 
access technologies provide the most energy-efficient 
solutions than other access technologies. 
B. Handover 
Daehyung Hong et al. [7] investigate the performance of 
cellular mobile radio telephone systems with handoff 
procedures. They consider the cellular structure, frequency 
reuse, and handoff for mobile radio telephone systems. In 
their paper, they also analyze the probability distribution of 
residing time in a cell and derive the handoff probability 
when mobile node resides in a cell to which its call is handed 
off. One of their results shows that mean channel holding 
time in a cell is increased as the cell radius is increase. Hyun-
ho Choi et al. [8] propose the new vertical concept, Takeover, 
which enables a neighbor node to process requests of a 
mobile node. Their proposed handover scheme has better 
performance in terms of average handover latency, packet 
loss and power consumption. In their results, energy 
consumption per a mobile node is increased if the speed of 
mobile node is lager.  
C. The User Population Density 
In [5], they present the power consumption per a user and 
energy per bit versus average access rate for typical access 
networks. Power consumption per a user and energy per bit 
are important factor on energy resource point of view. In 
their results, power consumption per a user is increased if the 
average access rate is larger. However, they only consider 
the maximum average access rates that each technology can 
achieve at user population densities.  
D. The Outage Probability 
S.Y. Baek et al. [9] investigate the adaptive transmission 
scheme for mixed multicast and unicast traffic. They 
proposed a novel hybrid scheduling scheme which is 
consider some threshold SNR values for multicast 
transmission. For users have less than threshold SNR, they 
transmit the data using unicast transmission scheme not the 
multicast transmission scheme. They evaluate the system 
performance of multicast and unicast transmission schemes 
in terms of system capacity, worst average channel user’s 
capacity, 
and 
outage 
probability 
for 
varying 
cell 
environments.  According to their results, the outage 
probability of the multicast transmission increases as the cell 
radius increases. Moreover using their novel hybrid 
scheduling scheme, multicast capacity improves than 
conventional scheme. However in this paper, the power 
consumption is not also considered in this paper. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODELING AND PERFORMANCE 
We first describe a system with a typical urban macro-
cell model which has cell radius about 1.5km to 3.5km. Each  
 
Figure 1. Area power consumption versus cell size 
base station consisted of hexagonal cell and one hexagonal 
cell area has  = √
  value where the cell radius is . We 
assume the traffic density has uniformly distribution. Also, 
we assume the user popular density of total area is fixed and 
we only consider the base station’s transmission power not 
mobile node’s transmission power. Because the multicast 
transmission scheme is more efficient way of reducing 
resource waste, we assume that this system provides the 
multicast transmission scheme. In multicast system, even 
though the worst channel user should be guaranteed quality 
of service. 
A. Base Station Transmit Power 
Consider the propagation model [10] without shadowing, 
we can define the transmitted power of BS where the signal 
level is at least 	
 follows 
P =

 R,  
 
(1) 
where  , 	
 , and λ denote transmit power, minimum 
transmit power at the cell boundary, and path loss exponent, 
respectively. In multicast service environment, the power at 
the cell boundary has minimum requirement power value 
because multicast service should provide the requirement 
data rate to worst channel user. Therefore, we fix the 
minimum power value at the cell boundary to guarantee the 
data rate. In macro cell environment, the effective 
propagation parameters are supported as path loss and the 
factor , 4.00 and  2.2751, respectively. 
Figure 1 shows the area power consumption as radius of 
BS is increased. The transmit power of BS is proportional to 
cell radius and also area power consumption, which is power 
consumption in unit area not a base station’s transmit power, 
is increased when cell radius is increased. 
B. Handover Rate 
We take into account the handover rate to increase cell 
size. In more frequent handover environment, user’s mobility

Figure 2. Probability of handover reside time versus radius 
could not be guaranteed. Therefore, the handover rate is 
important factor in wireless system supporting mobility. In 
[7], the probability of the time,  , a mobile resides in a cell 
to which its call is handed off is defined as

where VNO, and RPQ are maximum speed of mobile terminal 
and radius of approximation circle, respectively. In this 
model, we set the speed is 30km/h. Also, we assume the 
maximum handoff time is fixed and then we can find the 
probability of handover varying cell radius. 
Figure 2 shows the probability of the handover which a 
mobile node resides in a cell when its call is handed off and 
maximum handover time is fixed. The probability of that is 
decreased when cell radius is increased. Following this 
results, the handover is occurred more frequently when the 
cell radius goes to smaller. The probability is 0.035 when the 
cell radius is 1.5km and the probability goes to 0.015 when 
cell radius goes to 3.5km. However, the effect of cell radius 
for handover is very small. Therefore, we can ignore the 
effects of the handover rate by reducing cell size not 
considering the handover latency in macro cell environment. 
C. The Number of Users per One Base Station 
The number of users per one BS is lower when the cell 
size is decreased. When the cell size is decreased, coverage 
of a BS is also decreased. In this paper, we consider the 
number of users per one BS and the transmit power of BS 
per the number of user in a cell.  
First, we investigate the number of users in a cell versus 
cell size. We assume that there are 10 users in 1RS and 
users are uniformly distributed. Therefore, the number of 
users in a cell is expressed as 
 
Figure 3. The number of users in a cell versus cell size

, 
(3) 
where UVis the area of BS and Y\	]^Z is the sample area. It 
is proportional to  because the BS coverage is proportional 
to  and the other terms are constant value. Figure 3 shows 
its result so that the number of users in a cell is increased 
when the cell size is increased.  
Next, we investigate the power per one user in a cell. It is 
important factor considering energy resource management. 
We can say that the energy efficiency is low when the power 
consumption per user is low even though the total power 
consumption is large. Therefore, we also consider the 
transmit power of BS per users in a cell and it is defined as 
XYZ[ =
fg1
hab_ic3j. 
 
         (4) 
Figure 4 shows the transmit power of BS per the number 
of users in a cell. Even though the number of users in a cell 
is increased when the cell radius is increased, the transmit 
power of BS per the number of users in a cell is increased. 
Therefore, reducing cell size is more energy efficient way 
than others in terms of allocated amount power for one user.

D. The outage probability 
In this paper, we consider the multicast transmission 
system. In multicast transmission, the outage probability is 
increased as the cell radius increases. From [8], the 
conditional pdf of selected users’ SNR value is expressed as

The parameter L means the number of users in a cell and 
R is the cell radius. We can calculate the number of users in 
a cell using ratio of BS coverage and sample area. Then, the 
outage probability of the multicast transmission scheme is 
expressed as

Figure 5 shows that the outage probability is increased 
when the cell radius is increased. The outage probability is 
4.312 × 10v7  when the cell size is 1km and the outage 
probability is 0.0522 when the cell size is 3.5km. Therefore, 
there is advantage of reducing cell size in the aspect of 
outage probability.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we focus on the total base station power 
consumption, handover rate, the allocated power per user in 
a cell, and outage probability as varying cell size. Our 
analyses show that the power consumption and outage 
probability are proportional to the cell size.  However, the 
handover probability and the number of users in a cell are 
inversely proportional to the cell size. Therefore considering 
energy efficiency, reducing the cell size is the most energy 
saving way in the aspect of base station power consumption. 
However in terms of handover, reducing the cell size does 
not guarantee the user’s QoS or mobility. Finally, these two 
different aspects have trade-off relationship. Therefore, it is 
helpful for cell planning because our analyses show that 
these aspects should be considered.  
On the contrary, the total power consumption will be 
increased from some point when the frequent handover is 
occurred because of the handover signaling. In addition, 
more base stations can consume more power consumption 
because of the initial power consumption of BS.  
In future work, we will investigate the some optimal 
energy efficient point based on WDM-PON for HMIPv6 
mobility support and also base station’s power consumption.
