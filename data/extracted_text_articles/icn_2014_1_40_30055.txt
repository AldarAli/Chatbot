Abstract—A mobile ad hoc network (shortly, MANET) that
consists of mobile nodes (shortly, nodes) is one of autonomous
decentralized networks. Since the network topology changes
frequently due to the node movement, it is difﬁcult for each
node to grasp the application (service) in MANETs. In order to
solve this problem, the service information discovery scheme using
mobile agents has been proposed for MANETs. In this scheme,
a mobile agent collects and disseminates service information
while moving autonomously from a node to another node in
the network. However, in heterogeneous MANETs, mobile agents
cannot migrate between different MANETs. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose the mechanism to efﬁciently collect and
disseminate service information based on mobile agent, and then
show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through simulation
experiments.

INTRODUCTION
A Mobile Ad Hoc NETwork (MANET) [1] is a wireless
distributed network that consists of only mobile nodes without
the aid of the access points and ﬁxed infrastructure. When
a node wants to communicate with another node outside the
transmission range, both nodes can be communicated with
each other through intermediate nodes between the two nodes.
Since a MANET is easily conﬁgured by only mobile nodes,
many types of MANETs are used for a variety of application.
The number of nodes in a MANET, the frequency of the
topology change or the total volume of data trafﬁc is different
among multiple MANETs. Therefore, a routing protocol that
is appropriate for each MANET is different and each MANET
uses a different routing protocol because the characteristics
of each MANET is different. However, in this case, even if
multiple MANETs coexist nearby in an area, MANETs cannot
communicate with each other because routing protocols are
different. As a result, each node cannot obtain many infor-
mation that could obtain from nodes in different MANETs.
One idea to solve this problem is that all MANETs use the
identical routing protocol. However, in this case, it is expected
that the performance may degrade in each MANET. The other
idea is to deploy the network gateway between MANETs
to connect with each other like the Internet. Therefore, we
have proposed the mechanism to select the network gateways
to provide the interoperability between different MANETs
in [7]. The selected nodes serve as the network gateway,
but the network gateways change with time because nodes
are always moving in MANETs. In this paper, we deﬁne
the network that multiple MANETs coexist in an area and
each MANET can communicate with another MANET as a
heterogeneous MANET environment. In addition, there is no
network administrator to manage all services, it is difﬁcult
for nodes to discover the services in the network because the
network topology changes. Therefore, many service discovery
schemes [2], [3] have been proposed for the mobile ad hoc
network environment.
In this paper, we propose a mobile agent-based service
collection and dissemination scheme and a new node architec-
ture for the proposed scheme, and then show the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme through simulation experiments. In
this scheme, mobile agents collect and disseminate service
information that each node holds while migrating from a
node to another node, and we have shown that mobile agents
can efﬁciently work in MANETs [5]. In the heterogeneous
MANET environment, as the number of network gateways in
the network increases, much more links to connect between
MANETs are conﬁgured, but the overhead becomes much
higher. Therefore, in [7], the number of network gateways
becomes as low number as possible in comparison with the
tonal number of nodes in the network. A service information in
a MANET must be forwarded to another MANET through the
network gateways between these MANETs. Therefore, mobile
agents have to migrate from a node to another node while
considering the location of the network gateway nodes that are
dynamically changed in heterogeneous MANET environment.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the node architecture in the proposed scheme. Section
III shows the proposed scheme in more detail. In Section IV,
we evaluate the proposed scheme and show the simulation
results. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section V.
II.
NODE ARCHITECTURE FOR HETEROGENEOUS
MANETS
In order to implement the proposed node architecture, the
mechanisms of autonomous clustering [4] and ATR(Ad hoc
Traversal Routing) [6] in each node are required as a common
platform. Each node has the routing protocol speciﬁed by the
network on the common platform. In the heterogeneous mobile
ad hoc network environment where some networks exist, each
network is divided into multiple clusters and the nodes in
the cluster is managed by the autonomous clustering. In the
proposed scheme, each cluster in the networks autonomously

and dynamically selects one or more network gateway nodes
from the nodes in the cluster. The nodes which become
network gateway nodes can forward any packets to nodes of
the different network by using the mechanism of ATR so
that the interoperability between different networks can be
provided.
A. ATR(Ad hoc Traversal Routing)
We have proposed ATR that provides the communication
between different networks in heterogeneous MANETs. We
deﬁne a node that both any routing protocol and ATR work as
a NwGW (Network GateWay) node. A NwGW node converts
from control packets of a routing protocol into control packets
of ATR and vice versa. As a result, a node in a network can
communicate with another node in a different network through
NwGW nodes.
We explain ATR using an example as shown in Figure
1. Given that there are two networks, which are Network 1
and Network 2, and nodes A and B belong to Network 1 and
nodes C and D belong to Network 2. When node A wants to
communicate with node D, the route between nodes B and C
cannot be created because the routing protocols are different.
However, in this example, ATR works on nodes B and C so that
nodes between Network 1 and Network 2 can communicate
with each other through nodes B and C. Node B that receives
a control packet of routing protocol A from node A converts
from the control packet to a control packet of ATR, and then
forwards it to node C. Node C that receives the control packet
of ATR converts from the control packet to the corresponding
control packet of routing protocol B, and then forwards it to
node D. As a result, the route between nodes A and D can be
created through nodes B and C.
B. Network Gateway Selection Scheme Based on Autonomous
Clustering
In each network, the NwGW nodes must be selected to
forward any packets from a network to another network in
heterogeneous MANET environment. In MANETs, since all
nodes are always moving, NwGW nodes must be dynamically
selected from nodes in each network according to the topology
change. Therefore, in order to select NwGW nodes dynami-
cally in each MANET, we proposed an autonomous clustering-
based dynamic network gateway selection for heterogeneous
MANETs [7]. Autonomous clustering is the scheme to divide
the network into multiple clusters. Each cluster consists of one
cluster head, some gateways, and cluster members.
Figure 2 shows the outline of the heterogeneous MANET
environment based on the network gateway selection scheme.
In Figure 2, there are two networks, which are Networks 1
and 2. In each network, NwGW nodes are selected based

environment, any packets are forwarded from Network 1 to
Network 2 through the link between two NwGW nodes in
different networks, which are nodes F and H.

MOBILE AGENT MANAGEMENT MECHANISM
A. Outline
The purpose of the mobile agent-based service collection
and dissemination scheme is to collect and disseminate service
information for a shorter time in heterogeneous MANETs.
In heterogeneous MANETs, the proposed scheme creates a
mobile agent when a NwGW node holds service information
and the other mobile agents do not come to the NwGW node
for a certain period.
B. Mobile Agent Migration Mechanism
In Moving Average-based (MA-based) migration mecha-
nism, mobile agents recognize the service information that
each of neighboring nodes newly obtained for a speciﬁed
period and migrate to the neighboring node that the number of
the services is the lowest. Here, we deﬁne the speciﬁed period
as the service collection time.
We explain the mobile agent migration mechanism using
Figure 3. Given that there are three nodes: nodes S, A, and
B, and a mobile agents is staying at node S in Figure 3. Each
table denotes the list of service information that each node
manages. First, as shown in Figure 3 1⃝, node S that a mobile
agent is staying broadcasts a Service Information REQuest
(SIREQ) including Service ID of node S to obtain the service
22

information from neighboring nodes like SN-based migration
mechanism. Then, as shown in Figure 3 2⃝, nodes A and B that
received the SIREQ from node S sends a Service Information
REPly (SIREP) back to node S. Here, the SIREP includes the
service information that the mobile agent does not have and
each node (that is, nodes A and B) has, and a set of services
(SPTi) that each node i newly obtained for a speciﬁed period.
In this time, if the neighboring nodes do not have the service
information contained in the SIREQ, they can obtain a new
service information from the SIREQ. Finally, the mobile agent
that received the SIREPs from the neighboring nodes migrates
to the node that the number of new obtained services for the
speciﬁed period is the lowest.
For example, given that node S receives SIREPs from
nodes A and B as shown in Figure 3. In this case, SPTA =
{A} and SPTB = ∅. Therefore, the mobile agent migrates to
node B such that |SPTB| < |SPTA|.
C. Mobile Agent Creation-Termination Mechanism
The mobile agent creation-termination mechanism creates
or terminates mobile agents to control the number of mobile
agents in the network.
1) Mobile Agent Creation Conditions: A mobile agent is
created on a node when one of three conditions is satisﬁed.
Condition 1:
A node with a service generates or
updates a service．
Condition 2: A node does not receive a SIREQ for a
speciﬁed period．
Condition 3: A node is selected as a NwGW node
and it has collected service information for a speciﬁed period,
which is deﬁned as a service collection time, in the past.
By Condition 1, the generated service or updated service
is disseminated by mobile agents. By Condition 2, the node
creates a mobile agent when each node judges that the number
of mobile agents in the network is low. By Condition 3,
a NwGW node creates the mobile agent in order to easily
migrate the mobile agent between different networks.
2) Mobile Agent Termination Conditions: A mobile agent
is terminated when one of following two conditions is satisﬁed.
Condition 1: A mobile agent receives a SIREQ from
the other mobile agents．
Condition 2: A node with a mobile agent does not have
neighboring nodes．
By Condition 1, the node terminates a mobile agent when
the number of mobile agents in the network is high. By
Condition 2, the node terminates a mobile agent when a mobile
agent cannot disseminate service information.
D. Types of Mobile Agents
The proposed scheme uses two types of mobile agents in
heterogeneous MANETs.
IMA (Internal MA): A mobile agent disseminates ser-
vice information in a network.

EMA (External MA): A mobile agent disseminates

IMAs are created by Conditions 1 and 2 of the mobile
agent creation mechanism in order to disseminate service
information in a network. EMAs are created by Condition 3 of
the mobile agent creation mechanism in order to disseminate
service information between NwGW nodes in each network.
A mobile agent transits from the EMA to the IMA in order to
disseminate service information in the network after the EMA
has migrated between different networks.
In Figure 4, there are two networks, which are Networks 1
and 2 in heterogeneous MANET environment, and nodes B and
E are NwGW nodes in Networks 1 and 2, respectively. In the
proposed scheme, the IMA migrates from a node to another
node while collecting and disseminating service information
only in each network. On the contrary, the EMA is generated at
node B in Network 1, and then it migrates from node B to node
E to disseminate service information in Network 2. After that,
the EMA becomes the IMA of Network 2 and disseminates
service information only in Network 2.
IV.
SIMULATION EVALUATION
We conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the pro-
posed scheme through network simulator QualNet [8]. We
show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison
with Random scheme.
Random scheme is a scheme to randomly migrate mobile
agents from a node to another node without considering the
efﬁcient service collection and dissemination. Here, mobile
agents in Random scheme are generated only by Conditions 1
and 2 of mobile agent creation conditions.
A. Simulation I
In Simulation I, we investigate the property of the service
collection time of the proposed scheme.

1) Simulation Plan: We conducted simulation experiments
in the environment where there are two types of MANETs
in the ﬁeld. Table I shows simulation environment. In the
simulation experiment, the service collection time of the
mobile agent creation condition is set at 10, 50, 100, and
200 seconds. Evaluation criteria are the service dissemination
time versus the service dissemination ratio and the number of
EMAs. Here, the service dissemination ratio is the ratio of the
number of service disseminated nodes to the number of nodes.
In addition, one node in Network 1 generates a new service at
ﬁxed intervals from the simulation start to the end. First, we
investigate the inﬂuence on the service generation interval in
two cases as follows. In Case 1, the number of services and the
service generation interval are set at 10 and 50 seconds, while
in Case 2, the number of services and the service generation
interval are set at 100 and 5 seconds, respectively. Next, we
show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison
with Random scheme.
2) Results for the effect on the service collection time:
Table II shows the service dissemination time versus the
service collection time in Cases 1 and 2, and Table III shows
the number of generated EMAs. The service dissemination
times in both Cases 1 and 2 become shorter as the service
collection time increases from 10 to 100, while there is no
difference between 100 and 200 of service collection time. As
shown in Table III, the number of EMAs increase as the service
collection time becomes more. When the service collection
time is 200, the number of EMAs becomes more than the
service collection time 100. However, the dissemination time
of the service collection time 200 does not become shorter
than that of the service collection time 100. As a result,
even if the service collection time becomes more and more
EMAs are generated, the service dissemination time does not
become shorter. Therefore, we can conﬁrm that the service
collection time 100 is appropriate for the proposed scheme in
this experiments.
3) Results for the effectiveness of the proposed scheme:
In the simulation experiments, the service collection time of
the proposed scheme is set at 100 [sec]. Table IV shows the
service dissemination time in Cases 1 and 2. The proposed
scheme becomes shorter than Random scheme in both cases
because of the mobile agent migration mechanism as well as
the mobile agent creation condition 3.
Next, we focus on the service dissemination time in Net-
work 1 where there is the service generation node. Table
V shows the service dissemination time in Network 1. As

shown in Table V, the dissemination time of the proposed
scheme becomes shorter than that of Random scheme. In the
proposed scheme, mobile agents migrate to a node in which
the number of service information obtained for the service
collection time is the lowest, while in Random scheme, mobile
agents randomly select the node to which they migrate.
Next, we focus on the time when the service information
is forward from Network 1 to Network 2 in order to show the
effectiveness of the mobile agent creation condition 3. Table
VI shows the service dissemination start time in Network 2. As
shown in Table VI, the proposed scheme can disseminate the
service information to the neighboring network (Network 2)
in a shorter time. In the proposed scheme, in case that NwGW
nodes have obtained a new service information for the service
collection time in the past, they create EMAs to disseminate
the service information to the neighboring network. On the
contrary, in Random scheme, only when mobile agents arrive
at NwGW nodes, the service information is disseminated to
the neighboring network. Therefore, the proposed scheme can
provide the efﬁcient service information dissemination among
networks.
Finally, we focus on the overhead. Figure 5 and Table
VII show the number of MAs versus simulation time and
the number of MAs per second. The proposed scheme creates
EMAs by the mobile agent creation condition 3 to disseminate
the service information to the neighboring network. However,
as shown in Table VII, there is no difference between the
proposed scheme and Random scheme because the number
of MAs is adjusted by the mobile agent creation-termination
mechanism.
Table VIII shows the total volume of control packets from
the simulation start to 1000 seconds. As shown in Table VIII,
the proposed scheme becomes 10 percents more than Random
scheme because SIREQ packets are generated by the mobile
agent termination mechanism due to EMAs.
B. Simulation II
In Simulation II, we conﬁrm that the proposed scheme
can be applicable for service collection and dissemination
in heterogeneous MANET environment where the number of
networks is three. From the results of Simulation I, the service
collection time is set at 100 seconds in Simulation II.

NwGW node that holds any service information does not hold
a mobile agent for 30 seconds, it generates a mobile agent by
Mobile agent creation condition 3. In the simulation, nodes in
MANET 1 generates ten services at 10 second interval from
the simulation start.
2) Simulation results: Figure 6 shows the service dissem-
ination rates of the proposed scheme and Random.
From Figure 6 , we can conﬁrm that the proposed scheme
can disseminate service information in a shorter time than Ran-
dom. This is because mobile agents can appropriately decide
the next node that they should move according to the mobile
agent migration mechanism. On the other hand, in Random
scheme mobile agents move to the node that does not require
the service dissemination and collection because mobile agents
randomly move around the network. In addition, the proposed
scheme generates EMAs (External Mobile Agents) to forward
service information between different MANETs. Therefore, in

the heterogeneous MANET environment, the proposed scheme
could disseminate service information from MANET 1 to
MANETs 2 and 3 in a shorter time.
Figures 7 and 8 show the service dissemination rate in each
MANET and the number of generated EMAs, respectively.
From Figure 7, in each MANET, the proposed scheme can
disseminate service information in a shorter time than Random.
Figure 7(a) shows the service dissemination rate in MANET 1.
In MANET 1, the services are generated and disseminated by
mobile agents, and then the proposed scheme can disseminate
service information in a shorter time than Random. In the
proposed scheme, mobile agents migrate from a node to an-
other node by the mobile agent migration mechanism, while in
Random scheme, they migrate randomly. On the contrary, be-
cause MANETs 2 and 3 does not generate service information,
MANETs 2 and 3 can disseminate service information after
nodes in MANETs 2 and 3 receive service information from
mobile agents that are migrated from MANET 1. Figures 7(b)
and 7(c) show the service dissemination rate in MANETs 2 and
3. As shown in Figure 8, the proposed scheme can disseminate
service information between different MANETs by EMAs.
Therefore, especially in MANETs 2 and 3, the proposed
scheme can disseminate service information in a shorter time
than Random in comparison with MANET 1. Consequently,
we can say that the proposed scheme can disseminate service
information in a shorter time in the heterogeneous MANET
environment.
Next, we focus on the overhead. It is expected that the pro-
posed scheme becomes higher overhead than Random because
the proposed scheme generates EMA for service dissemination
and collection. Figure 9 shows the number of mobile agents
in the proposed scheme and Random. We can conﬁrm that
there are no big difference between the proposed scheme and
Random from Figure 9. In addition, Table X shows the average
number of mobile agents per 1 second in the proposed scheme
and Random. Here, in the proposed scheme, the ratio of EMAs
to MAs is only 0.003 %. As shown in Table X, the difference
between the proposed scheme and Random is very small. This
is because the total number of mobile agents is controlled by
the mobile agent creation-termination mechanism. As a result,
we can say that that the proposed scheme is appropriate for the
service dissemination and collection in heterogeneous MANET
environment.

CONCLUSION
We have proposed a mobile agent-based service informa-
tion collection and dissemination in heterogeneous MANETs,
and its node architecture, and shown the effectiveness of the
scheme based on the new node architecture in terms of the
service dissemination time through simulation experiments. In
the future work, we are planning to implement the proposed
node architecture on the mobile terminals like android smart
phones and verify the behavior in heterogeneous MANET
environment through ﬁeld experiments.
