Abstract—Stability of large-scale systems has been commonly
achieved using centralized and decentralized control conﬁgu-
rations. Several graph theoretic protocols have recently been
developed for the distributed stabilization of partially unknown
interconnected multiagent systems, when an upper bound on
the unknown interconnection allocation matrices is provided to
the control designer. The need for such an upper bound can
be relaxed using adaptive control ideas. However, due to the
inaccurate parameter estimation in the absence of the persistency
of excitation for all agents’ regressors, the use of traditional
adaptive control ideas will only ensure the boundedness of all tra-
jectories. We develop a data-assisted distributed protocol which
operates under a new condition, collective ﬁnite excitation, in
order to overcome this challenge. Despite the completely unknown
interconnection allocation matrices, we prove the exponential
estimation of all interconnection matrices and exponential con-
vergence of all state trajectories of the interconnected multiagent
systems to the origin.

INTRODUCTION
Along the advances in low-cost, low-dimension embedded
sensing, computation, and communication systems, graph the-
oretic approaches have received signiﬁcant attention in the con-
sensus of Multi Agent Systems (MASs). Initial studies focused
on the simple integrators or completely known agents [1].
Recently, the consensus for MASs with completely known
interconnections among agent dynamics [2] and local or agent-
level modeling uncertainties ([3] and [4]) has also been studied.
In particular, [4] discusses that the consensus on zero is a
nontrivial problem for MASs with modeling uncertainties.
Parallel to these efforts, the concept of multilayer control
using graph theoretic approaches was proposed [5]. Egerst-
edt [6] considered the use of graph theory to capture the
architectural aspect of cyber-physical systems for a completely
known MAS of interconnected integrator agents. However,
based on [7], we know that the cyber and physical layers of
cyber-physical systems might be subject to various abnormal-
ities.
With a focus on the modeling uncertainties over the phys-
ical (agent) layer, [8] proposed a graph theoretic decoupling
framework in order to stabilize an interconnected MAS subject
to the nonlinear modeling uncertainties. However, that result is
based on the locally (interconnection-free) stable agents, and
the control layer topology is identical to the completely known
agent layer topology. Rezaei and Stefanovic [9] reformulated
the solution approach in order to capture the architectural
aspect of cyber-physical systems, yet the result was limited
to a special agent layer interconnection topology. This issue
was addressed in [10], however, it was based on a symmetric
control layer topology. Rezaei et al. [11] designed several
structurally nonsymmetric control layers for interconnected
single and double integrator agents, and [12] developed two
design procedures to build structurally nonsymmetric control
layers for interconnected MASs subject to both matched and
unmatched nonlinear modeling uncertainties. Nevertheless, all
of these robust formulations require the knowledge about an
upper bound on the norms of the unknown terms, and may
end in a level of inherent conservatism (see section 4 in [12]).
Adaptive control ideas provide an appropriate framework to
handle a wider range of modeling uncertainties in dynamical
systems including networked systems. While the traditional
adaptive control methods have been reported in several studies
(e.g., see [13] for synchronization and [14] for consensus in
MASs), the need for the Persistency of Excitation (PE) [15]
might be problematic when the control signal depends on the
estimation of the unknown parameters [16]. This might be
serious challenge when dealing with an MAS. This is because
the poor transient performance of each non-PE agent can easily
propagate via the (networked) distributed controller which,
consequently, degrades the performance of the entire MAS.
Motivated by the aforementioned observations, [17] pro-
posed a cooperative PE condition to be satisﬁed by a group of
agents (vs. each individual agent of an MAS). However, similar
to the conventional PE condition, that cooperative PE condition
must be satisﬁed in all (future) time windows. Yuan et al. [18]
reported a cooperative Finite Excitation (FE) condition for the
adaptive consensus in non-interconnected MASs. Further, [19]
designed a cooperative FE condition for the stabilization of
interconnected MASs. That method is based on a series of
low-pass ﬁltered signals and the control layer is symmetric.
(See [19] for a more comprehensive survey of the literature.)
As discussed in [12], the use of an adaptive decoupling
approach may reduce the conservatism that inherently comes
with any robust control techniques. Therefore, motivated by
the ﬁndings in [19] and inspired by [20] (for single dynamical
systems), we develop a new data-assisted distributed protocol
to stabilize a class of linear time-invariant interconnected
MASs subject to the matched modeling uncertainties. The
control layer is built by two sublayers: A decoupling sublayer
to cancel the effect of the interconnections, and a cooperation
layer to stabilize the interconnected MAS even when the non-
interconnected agents are unstable or to shape the closed-loop
time response. The new data-assisted approach relies on the
use of a few data collection matrices to satisfy a collective

FE condition which enables us to potentially improve the
performance of the multilayer interconnected MAS using an
appropriate criterion from the literature of matrix algebra.
We theoretically prove that, under the proposed collective
FE condition, all estimated interconnection allocation matrices
exponentially converge to their actual values and, similarly,
all state trajectories of the multilayer interconnected MAS
converge to the origin. We also characterize the boundedness
of all trajectories during the transient time.
We overview the required notation and deﬁnitions in Sec-
tion II, provide the main theoretical developments in Sec-
tion III, and summarize the paper in Section IV.

NOTATION AND DEFINITIONS
A ≻ B (≽) means A−B is a positive (semi) deﬁnite matrix.
0 denotes a matrix of all zeros, diag{.} a (block) diagonal
matrix of the scalars (matrices) in {.}, col{xi} an aggregated
column vector, ∥.∥ the (induced) 2-norm of a vector (matrix),
and vec(A) ∈ Rmn is a vectorization of A ∈ Rm×n.
We consider three graph topologies: Ga to represent the
physical interaction of agents’ dynamics over the agent layer,
Gd a communication topology to compensate for the effect
of interconnections on agents’ dynamics using a data-assisted
strategy over a decoupling layer, and Gc a communication
topology for the controllers’ communication over a cooperation
layer. We allow the existence of selﬂoops over all layers where,
by a selﬂoop, we refer to an edge outgoing from and returning
to the same node without passing though any other nodes.
Since the standard deﬁnitions of adjacency and Laplacian
matrices do not admit selﬂoops [21], we redeﬁne them in the
rest of this section.
An agent layer digraph Ga with N nodes is characterized
by an adjacency matrix Aa = [aa
i j] ∈ RN×N where aa
ij ̸= 0
if the ith agent is affected by the jth agent’s dynamics for
i, j ∈ {1,2,...,N}, and aa
i j = 0 otherwise. Unlike the standard
deﬁnition, j = i is acceptable and each aa
i j is a real valued
scalar with either positive or negative sign. N a
i
represents the
set of ith agent’s neighbors over Ga which may include the
number i as well (selﬂoop). We introduce Sa as the set of
nodes affected by some neighbor agents over the agent layer
(including themselves through the selﬂoops).
The control layer is divided into two separate (sub-) graphs
with N nodes: Gc and Gd. We do not discuss the communi-
cation topology Gd for the data-assisted decoupling control,
because it is the same as Ga. A cooperation layer digraph Gc
with N nodes is characterized by a modiﬁed Laplacian matrix
Hc = Lc + Sc ∈ RN×N. Lc ∈ RN×N is a standard Laplacian
matrix for a digraph G ′
c, with non-negative edge weights ac
ij,
to be obtained by removing all selﬂoops from Gc: L c
ij = −ac
ij,
L c
ii = ∑j∈N c
i ac
ij, and N c
i
characterizes the ith agent’s (con-
troller) neighbors over G ′
c. Also, Sc = diag{sc
i } ∈ RN×N is a
diagonal matrix to represent selﬂoops: sc
selﬂoop around the ith controller, and sc i > 0 when there is a
i = 0 otherwise. These
selﬂoops and directed one-way communications between the
control nodes create a structurally nonsymmetric control layer.
A typical three-layer (closed-loop) interconnected MAS
is depicted in Figure 1. Both Ga (thus, Gd) and Gc can be
disconnected; however, all control nodes in each connected
component of Gc must have access (direct path) to at least one
node with a selﬂoop.

We consider a MAS of N agents with the following
interconnected dynamics:

This design procedure for structurally nonsymmetric con-
trol layer is modiﬁed from [12] such that, now, the state
weighting matrix Wx of the LQR problem is chosen completely
arbitrary. We note that the candidate stabilization gain K is
characterized as follows [24]:
K = −κW −1
v
BT P
(11)
in which the positive deﬁnite matrix P ∈ Rnx×nx is the unique
stabilizing solution of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE):
AT P+PA+Wx −κ2PBW −1
v
BT P = 0
(12)
The existence and uniqueness of P follow from the stabiliz-
ability and observability of (W 1/2
x
,A,κB]).
We use (11) and (12), and ﬁnd the following equalities:
∆⊗(AT P+PA+Wx −κ2PBW −1
v
BT P) =
0
∆⊗(K +κW −1
v
BT P) =

(13)

MAS of networked nominal dynamics and the candidate gains

x =

∂x , ¯V = xT(∆⊗P)x, ¯Wx = ∆⊗Wx, and ¯Wv = ∆⊗Wv. (See [24]
for single dynamical systems.)
Remark 3: The results of this section remain valid if we
use a symmetric cooperation layer. In particular, Hc is a
(symmetric) positive deﬁnite modiﬁed Laplacian matrix with
strictly positive eigenvalues to be sorted as 0 < µc1 ≤ µc2 ≤
... ≤ µcN [10]. Then, Fact 1 holds with ∆ = IN. Further, Step 1
of Design Procedure 1 is satisﬁed with κ = µc1.
D. Data-assisted decoupling protocol
We start the design of udi in (5) for agents i ∈ Sa by
choosing an integration window length δti > 0 for each i ∈ Sa,
and integrating both sides of (4) from t −δti to t as follows:
∆gi(t) := xi(t)−xi(t −δti)−sgi(t) = BRgi(t)θ⋆
i
(15)
where the subscript “g” distinguishes the integrated variables
from the non-integrated ones, and the system-related signals
sgi ∈ Rnx and regressor-related matrices Rgi ∈ Rnu×nxnu are
deﬁned as follows for i ∈ Sa :
sgi(t) = Axgi(t)+Bugi(t)
and
Rgi(t) = ∑
j∈N a
i
aa
ij

which, when the collective FE Assumption 1 is satisﬁed, means
∑nDi
l=1 RT
gi(tl)Rgi(tl) ≻ 0.
The third property is guaranteed by the deﬁnition of
acceptable excitation time (17) which acts as a criterion to
decide whether we should consider new data in the update
law (18) or not. Therefore, the proof is immediate. We note
that at least one update exists for each data collection matrix if
the collective FE conditional is met. This is because we start
from Di = 0 and Di(nDi) ≻ 0 when the ith agent is sufﬁciently
and collectively excited at time tsi.
To facilitate the analysis of the main theorem, we aggregate
the cooperation signal uci of (5), and ﬁnd
uc = (Hc ⊗K)x
where uc = col{uci} for all i ∈ {1,2,...,N}, and Hc is the
modiﬁed Laplacian matrix associated to the nonsymmetric co-
operation layer Gc. We further ﬁnd the following representation
of the three-layer (closed-loop) interconnected MAS:
˙x = ¯Ax+κ ¯Bv+κ ¯B ¯Ecv+ ¯Bua + ¯B ¯C ¯
Aax
(19)
where ¯Ec =

q

λmin(P)Ω(t)
and ∥ ˜θ(t)∥ ≤

λmax(Γ)Ω(t).
Based on the ﬁrst step of this proof, ˙Ω ≼ 0 holds for all
time including 0 ≤ t ≤ ts. Thus,
Ω(t) ≤ Ω(0)= ¯V(0)+ ∑
i∈Sa
˜θT
i (0)Γ−1
i
˜θi(0) ≤ Ωb(0)
where Ωb(0) can be found from (20). Consequently, for all
0 ≤ t ≤ ts:
∥x(t)∥≤
