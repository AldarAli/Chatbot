Abstract—Determining the range between RFID tags and
readers, particularly in the UHF region, is subject of current
research topics. This paper presents a simulation-based ap-
proach, using spread-spectrum techniques to reckon the range
between UHF RFID tags and a reader system. The UHF-
RFID reader reads out the surrounding tags within its reading
range, with each tag containing information about its own
location. Accordingly, the reader reads the location of each
tag, hence being able to generate a basic map. To deﬁne the
most likely position of the reader itself, it must estimate the
distance to each of the RFID tags. This estimation is provided
through a spread-spectrum approach utilizing the complete
UHF bandwidth of approximately 150 MHz to achieve a high
positioning resolution. This work proposes particular distance
estimation techniques and presents results for such distance
measurements.

I. INTRODUCTION
The increase in sales of navigation systems [1] follows
the trend to know exactly where objects or persons (mostly
the person itself) are located. That is one of the reasons
why global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) like GPS
have become very popular. However, the usage of GNSS
systems is rather limited to outdoor navigation. Multipath
effects, high fading and blocking of satellite navigation
signals usually limit the usage of satellite navigation systems
in indoor areas.
In the past, indeed, great efforts were made to handle
these drawbacks for the indoor area. WLAN-based systems,
for instance, use the received signal strength (RSS) to
determine the position of a WLAN device. Unfortunately,
these systems need training sequences every now and then,
resulting in setting up reference maps with reference points
(also known as ﬁngerprinting) [2]. However, WLAN-based
navigation systems may be combined with inertial navi-
gation systems to receive a much better accuracy. Ultra-
wideband systems (UWB), unlike WLAN systems, calculate
the Time of Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival
(TDOA) and/or Angle of Arrival (AOA) in order to ob-
tain the position. One example using UWB-technology is
the Ubisense platform [3]. These UWB-based systems can
achieve a high accuracy due to their very high bandwidth
[4]. Besides the described indoor navigation systems exist
a lot more techniques to determine the position, including
Infrared, Bluetooth, GSM, etc. For instance, SpotON [5]
and LANDMARC [6] are RFID-based navigation systems.
Generally, both of these systems are based on measuring
the RSS to get the current position. However, both systems,
SpotON and LANDMARC, use active RFID tags resulting
in higher costs per tag (manufacturing and service). Another
RFID-based navigation system is described in [7] and [8].
This system is based on passive RFID transponders working
at 13.56 MHz (RFID-HF) using the ISO14443 standard with
the MIFARE extension. The major drawback of using RFID-
HF technology is the low communication distance.
The work described in this paper pursues the following
approach: The navigation system should depend on UHF-
RFID technology to allow a higher distance to the tags.
Also, the distance to be determined between reader and
tag shall not depend upon ﬁngerprints, reference maps, or
any other training sequences, including RSS measurements.
Nevertheless, the position of the reader shall be detected by
evaluating an TOA approach from reader to tag (of course,
several tags), whereas the, location-wise, ﬁxed tags, contain
their very own positions.
This paper shows some theoretical statements being
proofed in different simulation scenarios, which deal with
conditions mentioned above.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I gives a brief
introduction, whereas Section II describes the scenario of the
proposed work. The following section shows more details
how the system itself is designed and which techniques are
needed to achieve the position determination. Subsequently,
Section IV is offering simulation results regarding various
channel characteristics. Results are offered in Section V,
followed by a conclusion and a reference to future work
in Section VI.
II. SCENARIO
This section highlights the initial scenario the following
sections will be build upon. Assuming an arbitrarily given
room with usually UHF-based RFID transponders tagged to
the wall(s) or other ﬁxed, unmovable objects. Also, there is
an RFID reader, equipped with an omni-directional antenna,
somewhere in the room. Furthermore, the system is simpli-
ﬁed by assuming that all antennas (reader and transponder)

The underlying scenario to deal with
are positioned in the same plane (i.e., 2D, e.g., xy-plane).
Figure 1 describes this scenario. The ﬂashes between the
reader and the transponders demonstrate the different radio
channel links between each reader/transponder pair.
However, the distributed RFID transponders store position
data. These position data, at least, consist of latitude, longi-
tude and elevation or just relative coordinates. It is important
that every transponder stores its own position; that means
reading out a transponder would return its location within the
environment. It is assumed that the RFID reader reads out
all transponders within the reader’s communication range. In
that case, the reader knows actually where all the read out
tags are located - so that the reader may build a virtual map
including the location of every transponder. Unfortunately,
the RFID reader itself does not know where it is located.
Therefore, the task is to determine the position of the reader
within the cloud of transponders, meaning to enable the
reader to ﬁnd its own position by evaluating the radio links
to each of the transponders. Assuming additionally, that the
reader is able to determine the distance to each transponder,
the reader is able to locate itself by evaluating the positions
of all transponders.
Of course, there are several ways of estimating the
distance between RFID reader and RFID transponder. The
previous Section I showed some methods how to estimate
the current position using RFID technology, whereas the
subsequent Section III describes the proposed approach to
determine the distance between an RFID transponder and an
RFID reader.
Eexemplary applications of such an RFID-based system
for the indoor area would include pedestrian and automatic
navigation as well as methods for item searching and posi-
tion logging.
III. PROPOSED WORK
For estimating the distance between an RFID transpon-
der and the RFID reader, a method very much based on
radar techniques [9], particularly pulse compression radar,
is suggested. Of course, there are some major differences
between a classical pulse compression radar approach and
the following proposal.
The reader broadcasts, in addition to the carrier, a broad-
band signal in the range of the UHF transponders’ bandwidth
being between 100 MHz and 150 MHz. Due to the high
bandwidth, the normalized signal-to-noise ratio S/N, also
known as Eb/N0 (energy per bit to noise power spectral
density ratio), of the signal is very low. Wide bandwidth
signals using low energy are, for instance, ultra-wideband
(UWB) signals. UWB signals mainly occur in free-licensed
frequency bands, as the signal power is mostly less than
the average noise power. In Germany, since 2008, UWB
signals below 1.6 GHz may have a spectral power density
of -90 dBm/MHz (transmitted power). Assuming room tem-
perature, the noise power per bandwidth is approximately
-114 dBm/MHz at the receiver. A path loss of approximately
70 dB (describing the path loss among the way from the
reader to the transponder and back) results in an S/N of
-46 dB. Using such broad frequency bands and low S/N
ratios limit the methods to determine the distance between
tag and reader. That is the reason why spread-spectrum
(SS) technique is introduced. First, to achieve a processing
gain, and second, that due to the higher bandwidth a more
accurate positioning resolution is more likely to achieve. The
following subsections give some insights into the underlying
techniques.
A. Signal Spreading
A technique for coping within such low-S/N environ-
ments is called spread-spectrum. Methods of this technique
spread signals in order to achieve a higher bandwidth. This
technique leads to less interference, jamming, undeliberate
detection and some more features [10]. Of course, the
transmitter’s, but mainly the receiver’s architecture gets more
complex. Spread-spectrum technique is nowadays fairly
common (e.g., WLAN, UMTS, etc.). The spreading method
of choice in this work is direct-sequence spread spectrum
(DSSS). This method takes the incoming (data) signal and
multiplies it with a given spreading sequence. The sequence
usually exists of several chips, which have a smaller time
period than the bit rate. This leads to a spreaded signal com-
prising a higher bandwidth but with less signal power per
Hertz. Therefore, the power of the signal is spreaded within
the frequency domain. Despreading this spreaded signal at
the receiver is realized by multiplying the incoming signal
with the exact same spreading sequence the transmitter used.
Doing so, transforms the former spreaded signal into a
narrowband signal, again. This narrowband signal equals the
262

unspreaded data signal in the transmitter, usually with some
additive noise aspects in phase, frequency and amplitude.
1) Barker Codes: The performance of the distance deter-
mination depends very much on the implemented spreading
sequences. There are a lot of sequences, which usually differ
in autocorrelation performance, peak side-lobes, orthogo-
nality, etc. As orthogonality is not of interest as there is
no multi-user system (as e.g., described in [11]), only the
performance of the autocorrelation and the distance to the
highest peak side-lobes do matter. A good and simple choice
of adequate codes are Barker codes [12]. Usually, Barker
codes are used in radar and synchronization applications.
The 13-Bit Barker code is the only one with a side-lobe
of maximum +1. Another bunch of codes, called the PN-
codes (pseudo noise codes), can be used, too. These codes
may be created using shift registers. They have a slightly
smaller performance compared to Barker codes, but with
the advantage of being as long as wanted and, of course,
ﬂexible in means of being soft-coded (i.e. implemented in
software). In order to keep it simple, the 13-Bit Barker code
is used so far.
2) Cross-Correlation of Spreaded Signals: The question
is how to get positioning data out of these spreaded data
signals. As the transmitted signal is known a priori, and the
reﬂected, received signal from the tag is known at the reader,
too, both signals can be correlated to get the desired TOA
measurement. Assuming a simple additive white Gaussian
noise channel (AWGN), in which the received signal is only
time-shifted compared to the transmitted signal (with more
or less noise power); processing a cross-correlation between
the transmitted signal (time delay = 0) and the received
signal (time delay > 0), a correlation peak arises at the
delayed moment of time. If the transmitted signal is shifted
in time, that this correlation peak is at τ = 0, then the
time difference between transmitted and received signal may
be evaluated, as well as the distance to the RFID tag. An
example is given in Figures 2 and 3, in which the transmitted
and the noisy received baseband signals (Figure 2, shifted
by t = 20 ) are cross-correlated (Figure 3). The peak of
the correlation function is found at τ = 19.88. Due to the
additional noise the peak of the signal is not directly at
τ = 20, as the peak detection is processed by using quadratic
approximation.
B. Coherent Addition
In the example above, the S/N of the received signal is
still 3 dB, leading to an appropriate cross-correlation. Un-
fortunately, the S/N ratio within a real system would be in
the range of -50 dB and even less at the receiver. Therefore,
the peak detection would fail very often respectively not
delivering a proper result.
Improving the S/N of a signal could be achieved through
the usage of coherent addition. This means, that the incom-
ing signals are added to each other in such a manner, that the

Cross-correlation Φ(τ) between transmitted and received

timing issues from on signal frame to another stays constant
(coherent). In other words, the noise, which is assumed
to be Gaussian distributed, is canceled out. According to
the Cramer-Rao lower bound [13], the S/N ratio is linear
proportional to the number of coherent additions, under the
assumption that the error variance does not depend upon
both parameters. This is proved in simulations and further
discussed in Section IV.
To highlight the effect of coherent addition, Figure 4
shows the signal differences for an S/N of -20 dB with
resulting signals taken at n = 1, 10, 100, 1,000 and 10,000
coherent additions. Easy to recognize, that the S/N is
increasing with the number of additions.
The objective is to ﬁnd an accurate (i.e., minimal) number
of coherent additions n, to ﬁnally have a low error variance
σ2 for the peak detection, as this is a direct indicator for the
distance measurement, because the peaks itself determine
the distances between reader and tags.
C. Radio channels
As an example of the radio channels used in this work,
two different frequency-selective fading channels (presence
of multipath) are assumed. Both channels have an excess
delay of 127 × 100 ps = 12.7 ns. The channels are build
upon 128 discrete impulses, each with a distance of 100 ps
to each other. The ﬁrst pulse (at τ = 0) is a Rician channel
with Rician factor K = 2, whereas all the other channel
impulses are Rayleigh distributed. The average path gain of
each channel impulse is formed out of an exponential power
delay proﬁle Ac[τ] as in Equation (1).

Reader architecture
By changing the value of T0, different channel charac-
teristics may be formed. A high value of T0 compared
to the symbol period Ts of the signal to be transmitted
over the radio channel leads to a highly frequency-selective
behavior, whereas a low value of T0 will lead to a more
ﬂat channel characteristic. To underline this statement two
different values are allocated to T0 to describe two different
radio channels. Channel 1 is characterized with T0,1 =
100 · Ts, Channel 2 with T0,2 = 0.01 · Ts. Figure 6 shows
the average impulse responses of both channels. Average
means, that the average impulse response consists of the
mean of 10.000 simulated channel characteristics as every
sub channel impulse is either Rician (at τ = 0) or Rayleigh
(at τ ̸= 0) distributed. The frequency characteristic of both
channels is shown in Figure 7b and 7d together with a one

IV. SIMULATION OF VARIOUS SCENARIOS
This section deals with simulations carried out, to evaluate
the system’s performance and limitations for given radio
channels. The ﬁrst subsection will present simulations for
AWGN channels, whereas the following subsections will
refer to more realistic radio channels, including real ﬂat fad-
ing channels (no multipaths) and frequency-selective radio
channels (number of multipaths > 0). All simulations were
carried out using a symbol period of Ts = 10 ns by using
BPSK (binary phase shift keying) and an RRC (root raised
cosine)-ﬁlter with a roll-off factor of β = 0.5. This leads to
an occupied bandwidth of about 150 MHz. Furthermore, all
simulations use the 13-Bit Barker code, which was applied
to spread 10 bits of data. The simulations are based on the
model as given in Figure 5.
The simulation results show the error variance of the
detected peaks σ2
p over the number of coherent additions
n, whereas the variance refers to the variation of the peaks
around its mean value. The upper theoretical limit σ2
p,theor.
for the error variance, also referred to as S/N = -∞ dB, is
calculated as in Equation (2). The search room for the peaks
is arbitrarily limited to about ± one chip (exact: 1 1
16) with
a sample rate of 16 bit per chip. This leads to the limitation
of ±17 in Equation (2).

The theoretical limit is calculated by assuming a continuous
uniform distribution of the peaks within the search room and
matches an S/N of -∞ dB. The number of channel simula-
tion repetitions in order to receive a signiﬁcant variance for
a given n was set to 100.

Ts = 10 ns is greater (by a factor of 100) compared to T0,2,
this channel can be described as rather ﬂat. On the other
hand, the frequency-selective fading Channel 1 (Figure 6a)
with an T0,1 = 100 · Ts = 1 µs is really frequency-selective
as the symbol period is much smaller (factor 100) than T0,1.
The simulation results of Channel 1 are shown in Figure 11.
V. RESULTS
The simulations carried out in Section IV show three
aspects. One is the fact, that the theoretical assumption of the
error variance σ2
p being linear dependent on the reciprocal
of the S/N and the number of coherent additions n could
be proofed through simulation. This conclusion is valid
for the AWGN channel and for the ﬂat fading channel, at
least if the values of the error variance are not close to
265
ICN 2011 : The Tenth International Conference on Networks

the theoretical limit. The same assumption is almost valid
for the frequency-selective channel, on condition, that the
symbol period is much longer than the overall (average)
channel excess time, which, of course, leads to a more ﬂat
fading channel characteristic. As expected, the error variance
increases for a real frequency-selective channel (symbol
period is smaller than the overall (average) channel excess
time), as seen in Figure 11.
The second aspect is the upper theoretical limit of the
error variance, which is valid for all channel simulations;
refer to Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11.
The third aspect concerns the lower limit of the sim-
ulations regarding the frequency-selective fading channels
(Figure 10 and 11). An improvement of the S/N to values
greater than -10 dB would not lead directly to a smaller error
variance in contrast to the AWGN channel (Figure 8) and
the ﬂat fading channel (Figure 9). This phenomenon may be
explained through the inﬂuence of the intersymbol interfer-
ence (ISI) of the described frequency-selective channels.
Furthermore, an important issue to focus on is the choice
of an appropriate channel model. This model may be gen-
erated by either measuring out indoor areas (site-speciﬁc
approach) or deﬁning a statistical model (site-general ap-
proach). Both approaches show advantages, but for an ubiq-
uitous estimation, at least for indoor environments, the site-
general approach is more useful (see Equation (1)). This may
easily understood by assuming that indoor environments
change very fast (doors opening and closing, people, interior
positions change, etc.). Anyway, a statistical model should
be close to a worst-case scenario to provide a lower bound
for the error variance of the distance.
Last carried out simulations show, that with a given
maximum standard deviation σx of 15 cm, a sample rate of
fs = 1.6 GHz, and an occupied bandwidth of 150 MHz, the
minimum number of coherent additions, to achieve that stan-
dard deviation, is 1877 . This result is valid for an AWGN
channel model with an average S/N of -40 dB. Finally, the
total measurement time is approximately 2.44 ms.
VI. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
The paper presents an approach to estimate the position of
an RFID reader by detecting the distance to the surrounding
UHF-RFID transponders. As the tags contain their very own
location, the reader may generate a basic map with the
transponders’ locations and its own position by evaluating
the distances to the tags with the usage of various techniques.
These techniques include spread-spectrum, coherent addition
and cross-correlation approaches. The reader exploits the
maximum bandwidth the UHF-tags provide (approximately
150 MHz) to achieve a high positioning resolution. In order
to estimate the error variance σ2
p of the distance to the tags,
various simulations were carried out considering varying
channel characteristics to get a more realistic valuation of
indoor attributes.
Future work would include, more channel characteristics
as well as the non-linear behavior of the underlying UHF-
RFID tags.
