Abstract—In this paper, we propose a low-complexity spectrum
leasing game for the underlay CR network with PS using adaptive
rate-based pricing strategy. In the proposed scenario, an SU can
make a request for sharing a channel with multiple PUs and
pay for the spectrum lease in proportional to his transmission
power. In the meantime, the PUs can determine the leasing
price to maximize his own revenue at the cost of ignorable
throughput degradation; In other words, one can say that the PU
can actively protect himself from using the lower transmission
rate by adaptively rising the leasing prize, rather than passively
imposing interference-limit rule as in the conventional methods.
The simulation results show that the proposed spectrum leasing
game can grant SUs transmission opportunities without causing
PUs throughput degradation. Moreover, the convergency of the
proposed scheme is numerically proved, which accounts for the
existence of Nash Equilibrium.

INTRODUCTION
Due to the scarceness of spectrum and the increasing
demands for radio resources, the issue of radio resource
management (RRM) has attracted much attention for decades,
especially when the truth of extremely low spectrum efﬁ-
ciency had been revealed by the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) [1]. To improve the spectrum efﬁciency,
the technology of cognitive radio (CR) has been proposed to
opportunistically and temporarily utilize the so-called spectrum
holes [2]. Accordingly, many important CR-related topics
have been extensively explored, including spectrum leasing
(trading), spectrum sensing, sub-channel allocation, power and
interference control, cooperative communications etc [3]–[8].
Speaking of spectrum leasing (trading), the auction the-
ory, one of the important applications of Game theory, can
be utilized to design effective protocols for managing the
aforementioned interactions between primary system (PS) and
secondary system (SS) as well as the competitions between
secondary users (SUs) [9], [10]. Moreover, according to CR’s
operation modes, different spectrum leasing protocols can be
designed for the purpose of protecting PS and improving the
overall spectrum efﬁciency (more discussions can be found in
the following literature survey). One should note that the key
to the success of CR networks lies in the harmless interactions
between the PS and SS. Therefore, from the literature, one can
ﬁnd that whatever the spectrum leasing protocols are applied,
the well-known interference-limit (IT) rule is still pivotal to
regulate SS’s behaviors in the underlay CR networks.
In this paper, PUs can actively play the leading characters
in the spectrum leasing game in stead of passively imposing
the IT rule on SS. That is to say, rather than the IT rule, each
PU can adaptively set and announce the price for spectrum
sharing based on the degradation of his transmission rate. Note
that the acceptable degradation level depends on each PU’s
willingness and tolerance. Then, each SU can play a one-shot
game to decide the amount of power he can purchased from
each of PU. Afterwards, the PU may adjust the price based his
attainable transmission rate. The bidding process between PU
and SUs may go back and forth for several times until Nash
equilibrium (NE) is reached.
It should be noticed that, in the proposed scheme, all
the SUs who share the same channel (owned by a particular
PU) do not need to know whether the aggregated amount of
interference has gone beyond the IT threshold or not, which
may cost some considerable amount of message exchanges.
Via the simulation results, the proposed spectrum leasing game
can grant SUs transmission opportunities without causing PUs
signiﬁcant throughput degradation. Moreover, the existence of
a unique NE can also be proved numerically, which accounts
for the convergence of the proposed scheme.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, some important related works are reviewed. Section III
describes the system model and proposed spectrum leasing
game. Simulation results are provided in Section IV. Section
V concludes this work.

LITERATURE SURVEY
Here, we review several auction-based spectrum leasing
(trading) schemes in the underlay and interweave CR networks.
A. Underlay CR Operation Mode
In the underlay CR networks, PS can be protected by
imposing the IT rule on the SS’s transmissions. Thus, in
the following auction games, the SS’s transmission power is
regulated by this rule. In [11], two auction mechanisms were
14

designed to allocating power for SUs, of which an SU can
be charged according to the received signal-to-interference-
and-noise ratio (SINR) or transmission power. The charging
policies, in other words bidding strategies, were to reach
the pre-deﬁned balance, i.e. NE, between SUs. In [12], the
pricing method was included into the design of channel and
power allocations for the CR networks. Then, the distributed
price-based iterative water-ﬁlling (PIWF) algorithm as well as
the corresponding media access control (MAC) protocol were
proposed to reach NE. In [13], the authors allowed the primary
users (PUs) to join the auction game by actively adjusting the
tolerable amount of interference (the interference cap). Then,
a dynamic spectrum leasing strategy was designed to control
the transmission power for both PUs and SUs such that the
utility functions of SUs can be maximized under the limit of
the so-called interference cap.
In [14], the authors proposed a sub-optimal pricing strategy
for PS to own better revenue, and SUs can also adjust their
uplink transmission power to maximize their utility functions.
The price was set according to the amount of each SU’s
transmission power. Via numerical proof, the proposed method
was claimed to achieve fairness of power allocation between
SUs. In [15], the Stackelberg model was applied to deal
with the spectrum leasing problem between PS and SS. In
additional to the payment by SUs (i.e. revenue of PUs), a
shutdown mechanism was developed to prevent SUs from
using unacceptable transmission power such that the IT rule
can be satisﬁed. In [16], the problem of power control and relay
selection in the multi-hop CR relay-network was investigated.
An SU can pay prices to PUs who share the spectrum and SUs
who relays for him to obtain optimal performance. The effects
of difference pricing functions of PUs were investigated and
several distributed power control algorithms were developed
for the scenarios with single and multiple CR transmission
pairs.
B. Interweave CR Operation Mode
In the interweave CR networks, PS can be protected by
separating the access time slots or spectrum bands from those
of SS, and (or) by the helpful cooperative transmissions from
SS. In [17], for the purpose of maximizing quality-of-service
(QoS), a PU can allure SUs for cooperative transmissions
by offering a fracture of time slots in return. To own the
offered fracture of time, SUs compete between each others
following the distributed power control mechanism. The Stack-
elberg game was applied to model leader-follower relationship
between PU and SUs. In [18], a PU can set a price for time
sharing with a properly selected SUs and each SU can decide
the amount of time to purchase according to his own QoS
requirement. Note that the more time purchased, the more
power should be used to forward packets for the PU. Moreover,
an admission control mechanism was also develop to protect
the SUs who participate in the cooperation transmissions.
In [19], similar scenario was extended to multiple PUs, i.e.
multiple sellers, by adopting the framework of generalized
NE, of which these PUs competed with each other for the
cooperative transmissions from SUs. And SUs can become
willing to cooperate when the their QoS requirements can be
achieved.
In [20], during the spectrum leasing period, each PU can
preserve a required bandwidth for himself to satisfy his own
QoS. Then, SUs can bid for the extra bandwidth, rather
than the aforementioned a fracture of time, to maximize
their utility function and achieve the fair allocations, i.e. NE.
Similar scenario was also extended to multiple PUs. In [21], a
generalized Branco’s mechanism was proposed to tackle with
the spectrum trading between primary service providers (PSPs)
and secondary service providers. In the proposed model, the
PSPs (seller) can cooperate to gain maximal proﬁts and further
share these proﬁts. In [22], the bandwidth-sharing problem in
the multi-hop relaying cellular network (MCN) was modeled
by the reversed Stackelberg game. With the aid of a trust
model, the base station (BS) can encourage relay station (RS)
to cooperate and also discourage their misbehavior. Owing the
allocated bandwidth, the RSs can serve the nearby mobile
terminals. Via simulation results, the well-developed MCN
cooperation can maximize the overall network performance.
III.
SYSTEM MODEL AND SPECTRUM LEASING GAME
A. System Model
Now, we consider an underlay CR network (SS) imbedded
in the incumbent cellular system (PS), which is assumed to
be in the uplink transmissions using adaptive modulation and
coding scheme (ACM) with ﬁxed transmission power. Each
PU exclusively own a subchannel and he may share this
subchannel with multiple SUs. A CR transmitting end and a
CR receiving end form a CR transmission pair, which means
the CR network operates in the ad hoc mode. For simplicity,
a CR transmission pair is named SU in the following context.
In the proposed spectrum auction game, SUs can issue
spectrum sharing requests to the neighbor PUs. After receiving
these requests, each of PU can decide whether or not to join
this auction and then announce the price per unit of generated
interference if the requests are accepted. Note that a higher
price can resist SU from producing intolerable amount of
interference. According to the prices, each SU can decide the
amount of transmission power he can afford to allocate to each
of the subchannels. Several rounds of the bidding process (i.e.,
the price setting and power allocations) can give the balanced
portfolio (the so-called NE). In the following context, the
whole period of bidding process is named bidding phase.
B. Power Allocation of SS
The utility function of the ith SU can be deﬁned as

transmitter and jth SU’s receiver over the kth subchannel,
while GSP

is that between the ith SU’s transmitter and kth

PU’s receiver, i.e. the base station (BS); QP S
ki
denotes the
ith SU’s received interference from the kth PU; No accounts
for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN); λk is the
announced price for sharing the kth subchannel. Note that
αi is the adjusting weight factor which can personalize ith
SU’s characteristic. Moreover, observing (1), the ﬁrst term
and second term account for the capacity reward and spectrum
sharing cost (in other words, interference penalty). Also, the
summation explains the spectrum sharing property, i.e. an SU
can share multiple subchannels with PUs.
The goal of SU is to maximize the utility function via a
proper power allocation. Thus, we can now form an optimiza-
tion problem as what follows.

where PS
i = {P S1
i

i
} is the ith SU’s power allocation
vector, while PS
−i describes that of all the other SUs belonging
to ΩN. Prior to solving this optimization problem, it should
be noted that the concavity of U S
i (PS

−i) with respect to
PS
i can be proved by calculating ∂2U S
i /∂P Sk2

, of which the
negativity renders the proofs of its concavity and existence of
the maximum.
First, we relax the constraint of 0 ≤ P Sk
i

then solve the following KKT problem, which gives a power
allocation scheme to satisfy this constraint. The KKT problem
can be deﬁned as

C. Pricing Strategy of PS
Here, we deﬁne the utility function for PU.
U P
k =
[
λk − Ck · eβk(1−RP
k /Ro
k)]
IP
k
,
(6)
where Ck is kth PU’s reserved price (or the cost in other
words) for spectrum leasing; βk (similar to αi) is the price
weighting factor, which can adjust the sensitivity to the change
of transmission rate; Ro
k and RP
k denotes the original and
current transmission rate of kth PU, respectively; IP
k
=
∑
i∈ΩN (P Sk
i
GSP
ik ) is the amount of experienced interference.
Similar to the SS’s case, calculating ∂2U P
k /∂λ2
k can prove the
concavity of U P
k with respect to λk as well as the existence of
maximum. Also, observing (6), one can ﬁnd that the lower the
current transmission rate RP
k , the higher the cost of spectrum
sharing, which can result in a higher price (as proved by the
following equation).
Solving ∂U P
k /∂λk = 0 gives the optimal pricing strategy
of PU as
λk = Ck · eβk(1−RP
k /Ro
k) −
IP
k
(
∂IP
k /∂λk
) .
(7)
Note that whenever the price is changed, the variation of
experienced amount of interference with respect to price, i.e.
∂IP
k /∂λk, can be estimated by the kth PU itself.
D. Discussions on Information Exchanges
To put the proposed spectrum auction game into practice,
only two additional information exchanges over one control
channel are needed: one for SU to broadcast the spectrum shar-
ing request and one for PU to announce the spectrum sharing
price (λk). Observing (5), ΓSk
i
and GSk
ii
can be estimated by
some existing techniques (which are beyond the scope of this
paper). Also, thanks to the channel reciprocality, GSP
ik
can be
attained by listening to λk over the kth subchannel in the time-
division duplex (TDD) mode. Furthermore, observing (7), IP
k
and ∂IP
k /∂λk can surely be estimated by PU itself.
It should be noticed that conventionally, an IT rule should
be imposed on SS in the underlay CR network. However,
in the considered scenario that a PU can share his subchan-
nel with multiple SUs, some massive information exchanges
are required. For example, each of SUs should know the
percentage of the amount of interference he has produced.
Then the SU can actively control the transmission power such
that the IT rule is not violated. Or, alternatively, a group of
SUs can sequentially adjust their transmission power, which
may additionally cause some difﬁcult problems, e.g. how to
form the group of SUs and inform each of them, the fairness
issue, scheduling protocol design etc. Certainly, PU can also
inform each of SUs to adjust transmission power. However,
in either case, massive information exchanges as well as more
additional control signals are required.
IV.
SIMULATION RESULTS
The simulation environment is built up based on the
system model described in Section III(A). In addition, PUs are
uniformly distributed over the primary incumbent cell of radius
2000 (m). The transmitting end of each SU is randomly located
at where the distance to BS is uniformly distributed over the

end is positioned randomly at where it is 50-150 meters
away. The transmission power of PU and SU’s maximum
transmission power Pmax are 1 and 0.1 watt, respectively.
The power spectrum density of AWGN is -174 dBm/Hz.
The log-distance path-loss model with exponent of three and
ﬂat Rayleigh fading are assumed. Furthermore, the stairwise
effective throughput of ACM for PU are listed in Table I
[23]. In the simulations, it is assumed that there are two PUs
providing spectrum sharing opportunities to two SUs; And the
results are averaged over 2 × 107 simulation rounds.
A. Convergency
Here, we prove the convergence of the spectrum leasing
game by showing the convergence of the PUs’ price (λ1 and
λ2) and SUs’ transmission power. Figures 1 and 2 respectively
show the snapshots of PU’s price for β1 = β2 = 1, and SU’s
transmission power for β1 = β2 = 0 and 1. As shown in
the ﬁgures, the bidding phase can be completed within ten
iterations.
B. Impacts on PUs
In advance of showing the beneﬁt SU can obtain through
the spectrum auction, we ﬁrst present its impact on PU. Figure
3 shows the impact of SU’s activity on PU’s transmission
mode, i.e. ACM mode with (a) β1 = β2 = 1, and (b)
β1 = β2 = 4, respectively. It can be observed that when the
price weighting factor β equals to zero, PU can be severely
affected, and consequently the probability of using lower ACM
mode signiﬁcantly rises. One should note that the case of
β = 0 can be regarded as conventional method, i.e. simply
maximizing the utility function without adaptively adjusting

the cost Ck. In this situation, Pmax in (2) can be regarded as
the IT rule to regulate SU’s transmission power. Fortunately,
this unfavorable situation can be avoided by increasing the
weighting factor β, i.e. sensitivity to the change of throughput.
As shown in Figure 3(b), when β increases from zero to four,
PU can almost maintain the same ACM mode.
C. Beneﬁt to SUs
Figure 4 shows the average throughput of SU and PU with
respect to various price weighting factors (β). One can ﬁnd
that higher throughput can be reached by SU with lower value
of β. However, in this situation, it can cause larger loss of
throughput to PU. As aforementioned, rising the β value can
solve this dilemma. Therefore, using β = 4, both SU and
PU can maintain at high throughput of 3.84 and 3.44 bps/Hz,
respectively.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel spectrum leasing
game for the underlay CR network using rate-based pricing
strategy for PU rather than the conventional interference-based
method. By using the rate-based pricing strategy, several im-
portant advantages can be obtained. First, signaling overhead
can be signiﬁcantly decreased. Only two additional information
exchanges (one for issuing SU’s request and one for broadcast-
ing the price of spectrum sharing) over one control channel
are required. Second, PUs can actively join the auction and
protect himself from using lower transmission rate by rising
the price, instead of passively imposing the IT rule on SUs.
Third, both PU and SU can simultaneously maintain at high
transmission rates such that the overall spectrum efﬁciency can
be largely improved. Many interesting future works are worth
exploring, which could have potential impacts on the area of
CR networks. For example: (1) apply the Stackelberg model
to reﬁne the spectrum auction game; (2) mathematically prove
