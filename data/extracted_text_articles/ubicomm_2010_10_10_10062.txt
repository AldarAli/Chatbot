Abstract— Ubiquitous collaboration should be provided for 
pervasively children and business people in not relation to 
their socio-economical conditions. This ubiquity is freely and 
openly to access various chances and resources in networked 
communities for global citizens. New business and knowledge 
based economy can be engendered by these active people. In 
this regard, I will discuss needs, backgrounds, design, and 
practices of gaming collaboration for educing business senses. 
It was designed as one of the network based ubiquitous 
collaboration (e.g. Ubiquitous Jigsaw). I will articulate the 
Ubiquitous Jigsaw toward organizational development in 
business. And finally all things considered, I introduce 
practices of business gaming using this collaboration.

LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH 
INTERWEAVING WITH GLOBAL NETWORKS 
Our global society has been underlying in invisible 
networked linkages interweaving with enormous others who 
belonged in the global village. At the end of past millennium, 
Abowd et al had proposed the three goals of ubiquitous 
computation such as natural interfaces, context-aware 
applications, and automated capture and access [1]. 
Fortunately in technical revel, ubiquitous computation has 
been widening its research areas and adaptable ideas 
enriched by technical progress during this decade. These 
technologies provide citizens to achieve more effective 
mobile 
communication, 
wireless 
networks 
and 
interconnection 
anytime 
and 
anywhere. 
Indeed, 
the 
ubiquitous computation requires managing both human and 
physical networks. 
Network oriented services can heighten its potentials for not 
only mutual collaboration but acquaintanceships for 
matching people and positions in business and social life. 
Collaborations in online groups will be perceived as core of 
the feasibilities of networked cooperation (e.g. Wikipedia). 
Personal networks and interconnections with possibly other 
partners will be exactly the very fundamental core in 
business as well as daily life. And these available activities 
will be more pervasive and heighten the affinity of our life.  
Otherwise it goes without saying that we can already start 
new business through internet commerce using some handy 
devices and we can shake hands with various business 
partners beyond physical distance and our cultural 
differences. However, it is quite necessary that we enforce 
people and children to not only handle with these intelligent 
devices and services but cultivate business minds. As OECD 
[8] and the Pearson’s studies [9] had said that education of 
computer skills and world-wide internet based education 
would be one of the most favorite fundamentals for future 
children. Similarly, Yunus [14] also said that computational 
power using mobile phone can be expected as one of key 
successes factors against poverty in developing countries. As 
they make sense actually the nature of communication and 
socially oriented activities, efficient actual experiences on 
the bases of computational educations will be also beneficial 
to take further steps such as ventures and other borderless 
business for young generations in not only developing but 
developed countries. 
However, ubiquitous computation is still higher cost than 
any other solutions and more difficult for little pupils and 
elderly people in both developing and developed countries.  
So then, as I will answer to these requests, I’ve designed the 
Ubiquitous Jigsaw [12][13]. And I paved more reasonable 
way to experience collaborative learning that can be operated 
by low-cost and interactively styles on demands. For 
example, these are educational gaming and business 
simulation styles for not only business people but ordinary 
citizens and pupils without any expensive devices and 
computational power, when educators can’t prepare much 
educational content and attune learning conditions in 
advance because of cost, time, human factors and others.  
Further I often proposed that educators should append 
practical education about networking and collaborative 
activities among heterogeneous members whether they 
possibly receive computational services or not. That is 
because there are strong needs to teach informational 
techniques and fundamentals of business senses as well as 
harmonized coordination beyond their cultural and social 
differences among a lot of participants and partners all over 
the worlds. Namely, they have needs of a collaboration tool 
for learning opportunities to enhance business competences 
and to inspire network based business for the youth and other 
ambitious business leaders.  
In these regards, I intend to articulate my collaborative 
learning (e.g. Ubiquitous Jigsaw) and its applied gaming for 
business on the bases of these motivations after next chapter. 
II. 
THE UBIQUITOUS JIGSAW AS NETWORK BASED 
COLLABORATION 
A. The Goal for this Collaborative Learning 
I had implemented the Ubiquitous Jigsaw methodology that 
actualizes collaboration in networked community [12] [13]. 
It is one of the computer supported collaborative learning 
(CSCL) and refined educational activities of the Jigsaw 
classroom [2] on the bases of technologies of ubiquitous 
computing [1][16]. As widely known, an original 
collaborative learning of this style has been providing 
pedagogical solutions for cultural and racial conflicts and 
219

cultivating cooperative minds beyond differences among 
students in classroom. Needless to say, Ubiquitous Jigsaw 
had inherited from this fundamental concept, and it had been 
conceptualized to heighten the potentials for borderless and 
omnipresent computational networking era.  
As my implementation of this software architecture, I will 
consider to step it forward business collaboration. Indeed, 
our activities in actual societies and business scenes are very 
dynamic rather than static in classroom. And these situations 
often motivate us to prepare both those minds for 
cooperation and computational skills for adaptation in global 
competitive and/or collaborative relationships very much.  
Nowadays, informational resources for business already 
require three factors such as data resources, fundamental 
information architectures, and human resources on the bases 
of business and computer competences at least. Data 
resources can be easily managed by computational systems 
using cloud computing, online knowledge-database (e.g. 
Wikipedia, digital libraries, open course-ware, and etc.) and 
applicable data centers, for example. Besides fundamental 
information architecture can be also depend on a part of 
these services, and mobile devices (e.g. mobile phone, laptop 
computer, iPad and etc.) based communication is conceived 
to heighten dynamic management and collaborative activities 
in business. However, only human resources must be trained 
by 
appropriately 
practical 
ways, 
and 
properly 
interconnection and its rewiring among a lot of experts and 
partners is the very fundamental core of business in 
competitive environment. Hence, business competences can 
be also defined following standpoints. Here, these are 
enhancement of own core competences, finding job, 
interconnecting with preferred partners 
in business, 
adaptation in organization, and innovative creativity in 
heterogeneous group.  
So, the learning service of the Ubiquitous Jigsaw aims to 
cultivate the third factor as business competences. And a part 
of computational services in Ubiquitous Jigsaw can be 
depended on the first and second factors as ubiquitous 
oriented framework in particular [12]. Participants will 
experientially understand those points by this collaborative 
learning 
activity 
through 
social 
and 
computational 
networking. 
B. The Framework of Ubiquitous Jigsaw 
In brief, the collaboration of Ubiquitous Jigsaw has a 
potential to enhance collaborative activities more effectively 
[13]. Apparently, collaborative learning consists of various 
objectives to encourage each participant’s motivation and 
understanding to a greater extent than an ordinary learning 
style and environment. It is noteworthy that collaborative 
learning in ubiquitous computational environment can 
engender more interactive, experiential, spatiotemporal, and 
distributed aspects for those who want to learn and solve 
problems 
while 
coordinating 
with 
others. 
Applying 
methodological and technical concepts, coordination with 
computational implementations can enhance assistance with 
more appropriate educational services from each individual 
level to partners, group, and collective level. Excellence of 
this methodology can outperform traditional collaborative 
works to show an obviously pervasive combination with 
current computational theories. 
Even though many past researchers have explored 
collaborative learning and related computational support in 
diversified contexts and academic disciplines so far, 
collaborative learning has yet to be explored widely in terms 
of its pervasive possibilities. Learning environments can not 
be restricted physically, spatiotemporally, or in terms of 
boundaries in this advanced networking era. In addition, 
ubiquitous computation includes some subcomponents such 
as location based services, social context awareness oriented 
significance, spatiotemporal dynamics of human behavior, 
and integration with other machinery and computer 
technologies. These constructs of ubiquitous computation are 
applicable to educational services. 
A lot of educational networks such as online learning 
communities and e-learning constructs have inferred to be 
based on reciprocal acquaintanceships. The online learning 
community has been investigated in terms of traditional 
perspectives. However, I will intensify the learning 
community to include novel features such as reciprocity and 
self-organizing patterns, for example. Reciprocity is the basis 
of mutual trust and well-disposed understanding; at least one 
educational purpose would nurture the sensibilities of 
children using these satisfactory interactions. Moreover, self-
organizing perspectives in social networks suggest the actual 
cutting edge of the network. I envision collaborative peer to 
peer (P2P) like network patterns using mobile devices. Such 
a network is likely to generate and change its state and 
structure autonomously because mutual relationships in 
collaborative learning should form the foundation of 
students’ personal initiatives, rather than compulsive ones. In 
fact, reciprocity and the self-organizing nexus are two facets 
of a collaborative-learning network. For those reasons, I 
believe that collaborative learning must include reciprocal 
relationships and a self-organizing network structure. 
III. 
FOR GROUNDING ON THE BUSINESS 
A. Educing Business Senses and Motivations 
Next, I should articulate both academic backgrounds and 
practices of this gaming collaboration for business. Actually, 
grounding of fundamental educations for cultivating business 
competences is quite necessary.  
Generally speaking, I consider that recent career educations 
may lack some considerable factors. Namely, these are the 
network principle and social selection by preferred partners. 
The former is fundamental human relationship in social and 
business activities; otherwise the later is individual 
preference as well as reflexive mind by standing on the 
other’s view. Both it seems that these factors are essential to 
motivate development of the youth.  
So, as mentioned before, I am willing to apply a framework 
of the Ubiquitous Jigsaw for organizational development and 
relative learning activities in business. The concept of 
collaborative learning will be very harmonious with internet 
based 
services 
and 
cooperative 
education. 
This 
functionalizes as the platform of networked collaboration for 
training and brushing up business senses. Especially, I

discuss following four issues after this section in order to 
understand 
theoretical 
backgrounds 
of 
my 
business 
collaboration. 
1.Social Adaptation 
As cooperative activities, students may reflectively 
understand the meaning of social networking and group 
adaptation in terms of others’ perspectives. 
2.Interconnections 
Know-How and Know-Who as social interconnections with 
preferred partners.  
3.Heterogeneity and Creativity 
Management of heterogeneous group members and 
enhancement of group creativity. 
4.Innovative Mind 
Can collaborative activities lead young students into 
educing innovative mind for business? 
B. Social Adaptation: To Realize it by Networked 
Collaboration 
First, the collaboration is to literally cooperate and co-work 
with enormous other members within groups and societies. 
In social and organizational psychology, networked 
collaboration for this purpose will envisage a core problem 
on social adaptation to be group members.  
Needless to say, as we already known very well, social 
relationships is the very fundamental for social adaptation. 
Social network can be almost considered that social 
members are often dynamically connecting by each person’s 
preference and judgment for the sake of establishing 
appropriate relationships. Absolutely, social network in 
business is a kind of implicitly or explicitly selection process 
among preferred partners. And these social ties can enlarge 
to social structural conditions such as various communities 
and group hierarchical relationships. The preference-based 
selection has been clarified by many empirical findings. For 
example, Robins,G, et al [10] had discussed and exemplified 
their findings of social preference and selection process of 
preferable partners in social networks. 
With this in mind, Leary,M.R&Baumeister,F.R [6] 
recently discussed using their theory of socio-meter. Their 
theory supposes some hypotheses on both self-esteem and 
social adaptation in social relationships. It describes that 
mental awareness of oneself is affordable to amplify and 
estimate other’s mind in society. That is, theory hypnotizes 
that this function was acquired in evolving process in order 
to monitor other mental conditions for own adaptation. In 
other 
words, 
self-esteem, 
self-consciousness 
and 
identification are assumed to be symmetry mirror between 
self and other members. 
So then, social selection and exclusion in the community is 
often quite serious problem for adaptation of group members. 
Social members in their daily lives must seek to join more 
preferable and valuable social relationships. Namely a part of 
their social adaptations is dependently underlying in other 
member’s evaluation and preferences, and vice versa. As 
social preference is one of critical factors for various 
behaviors in social relationships, especially we can select 
favorite partners to satisfy with our self-esteem and 
motivation. For example, Rudich&Vallacher [11] had found 
some suggestions that subjects were apt to choose an 
interaction partner in order to maintain own self-esteem and 
self-enhance motivation.  
In these concerns, we can expect that students will realize 
to commit affiliation networks and they will maintain and 
improve their conditions if they will be educed properly. So 
it can provide possibly experiential learning services not only 
collaborative working but job seeking activities by 
computational assistances on demand. 
C. Interconnection: Know-How and Know-Who as 
Preferred Partners 
Here, it is worth saying that I can point out a fact on the 
power of interconnection in business. First, in business and 
daily life, we sometimes rewire effective pathways to 
exchange social capitals, information and knowledge in the 
process of reorganizing human relationships. As suggested 
before, social networks include fundamental processes of 
social selection to interconnect with preferred partners. 
Preferred partners are almost acknowledged as professionals, 
experts, business partners and favorable key persons in order 
to achieve specific business goals. So then, it should rewire 
and interconnect with nodes as those partners if we hope to 
success in business. And students should learn these factors 
if they wonder how to interconnect with those partners who 
have abilities to achieve business tasks by more effectively 
ways.  
Secondly recruit and employment are indeed to append or 
rewire social nodes with preferred partners in human 
relational networks. So, job position and career are based on 
network principle and social selection in order to 
interconnect with relationships [4]. It is a key factor to obtain 
new positions and open the gate for another career path. This 
is also beneficial for business education using computational 
services as suggested earlier. Being social member literally 
means to be an interconnected node in relationship nexus 
among other peoples, organizations and societies. Hence, 
students are needed to be preferred candidates as nodes in 
social relationships before job seeking. Without saying, 
applicants are required to attain properly social skills, 
abilities, potential, and not limited to these personal 
properties if they want to be hired. Hence it is necessary that 
we encourage the youth (and of course older people) to 
brush-up social skills and enhance their potentials, 
motivations and social abilities in social relationships.  
As an engineering case, Morisue,M, Nakano,Y &Tarumi,H 
[7] had developed a tool for job hunting. But it was not 
enough that they designed it standing on this social network 
principle. There are already information providing sites (e.g. 
Linked-In and etc.), it may be inspired from these services. 
Comparatively, the Ubiquitous Jigsaw should not only just 
provide much job information for university students. In 
contrast, this framework aims to inspire effective chances for 
collaborative business such as LLP (Limited Liability 
Partnerships), LLC (Limited Liability Company) and NPO 
activities interconnecting with other members and experts.  
Exactly human resources itself can be perceived as a kind 
of knowledge base (sets of know-how and expertise skill and 
memorized data), and it is more valuable than job 
221

information itself. These styles can not success unless 
participants cooperate with each other, namely it is a good 
example case for collaborative learning by the design of 
Ubiquitous Jigsaw. Further it has possible advantages for 
getting openly assistances to interlink with unlimited experts 
and unknown partners as well as online knowledge bases 
(e.g. digital libraries) through pervasively services. 
D. Boosting up Organizational Uncertainty and 
Heterogeneity to Group Creativity 
Taken together, I also expect organizational potentials and 
group creativity in networked collaboration. In due process 
of both educational and business purposes, there are needs to 
enhance members’ creativities and educe potentials of 
participants. Indeed, networked globalization engenders 
more heterogeneous and complex conditions in multiple 
levels from personal to social and business situations [3]. 
Heterogeneous network per se holds attractive potentials to 
engender novel idea and breakthrough in business and 
collaborative activities. Heterogeneities of social network 
consist of different and independent individuals who 
embrace their original attitudes, opinions and backgrounds. 
Heterogeneous and uncertain factors will be possible to 
facilitate group creativities and potential of members, but it 
often contains some hardly troubles.  
Absolutely, in global era, it is quite necessary to coordinate 
with ambivalent process of both remaining heterogeneously 
and even reducing uncertainty in group and organization. 
The traditional jigsaw method and cooperative activities had 
to conquer the differences of cultural, socio-economical, 
racial and other social properties [2], and they reported that 
their method was very effective to improve despairingly 
conditions in education. Similarly, as collaborative learning 
by the Ubiquitous Jigsaw will be also expected to harmonize 
with those ambivalent conditions, these heterogeneous 
conditions will inspire participants to conquer any troubles 
caused by group uncertainty and they regenerate it as 
dynamism for new business. 
E. Comparing with SECI Model: From Collaboration to 
Innovative Minds 
As already known, there is one of the most famous key 
tools named the SECI model, which proposed by Nonaka,I, 
for knowledge management in business organization and 
activities. The concept of Ubiquitous Jigsaw collaboration 
and the SECI model are not irrelevant to each other. Both 
concepts devoted to enhance the collaboration in inner and 
inter groups and communities underlying in actual 
knowledge and expertise linkages. The former focuses on the 
educational collaboration and sharing experience among 
people in ubiquitous and pervasive networks. In contrast, the 
later articulated the knowledge itself such as implicit and 
explicit aspects from individual to group, and theorized as an 
originally framework of knowledge based management in 
business process. 
In similarly, a learning design by communities of practice 
[17] [18] apparently shares the same root of both cooperative 
designs of activities in social contexts. But contrary, 
Ubiquitous Jigsaw can be designed to manage more 
pervasively computational assistances and online services 
than those two models in advance. So then, as taking mobile 
devices and like this, collaboration style by Ubiquitous 
Jigsaw can be regarded as seamless bridging between actual 
and networked communities interweaving with pervasively 
other participants through internet. 
IV. 
COLLABORATIVE GAMING PRACTICES FOR BUSINESS 
A. Design And Practices 
Here, I introduce detail practices of handy gaming 
collaboration on the bases of methodological backbone of 
the Ubiquitous Jigsaw as noted earlier chapter. Namely, it is 
an applicable services named as business gaming 
collaboration. It was designed to be openly for peoples’ 
participation and avoided affecting their socio-economical 
backgrounds. And it originated interactional gaming either 
with or without special devices, it can be adapted as a 
collaborative gaming in both online and offline conditions.  
Gaming itself has been nowadays widely recognized as an 
experiential learning style assuming a lot of social contexts. 
This collaborative gaming can be characterized by as 
following four types of cards such as Task, Data Access, 
Hint, and Ability. These types of cards are represented 
specific meaning such as practical allocated assignments, 
approval for special abilities (represented as own 
competences), 
approval 
for 
extra 
database 
access 
(represented as knowledgebase and know-what), and 
providing 
some 
hints 
(represented 
as 
know-how) 
respectively. Educator prepares printed cards or electrical 
ones in advance, and these are allocated for each small 
group and participatory student. 
・ 
Task Cards 
¾ 
These cards are assigned for each student, and they 
must achieve tasks printed on each card. For 
example, educators prepare cards on the bases of big 
themes such as “The World Heritages in Europe”, 
and “Your living City” in advance. Each assigned 
card should be considered difficulty level, time-
consumption, and other factors, as educator like. 
And finally, each group shall finish writing a report 
combining and integrating with achieved tasks by 
each participatory student on the whole. It is likely 
jigsaw-puzzle. 
・ 
Data Access Cards 
¾ 
These cards are represented as “Know-What” and 
access for knowledgebase. It can permit to access 
specific knowledgebase such as encyclopedia and 
internet resources for solving each task. Participants 
learn the nature of knowledge-intensive economy. 
・ 
Hint Cards 
¾ 
These cards are represented as “Know-How” and it 
permits students to teach any other student and he 
can obtain Points from him. Of course, any students 
can help other students without this Hint Cards, but 
in this case the total cost of payment to reward 
222
UBICOMM 2010 : The Fourth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies

Points for helping student is higher than use of Hint 
Cards. 
・ 
Ability Cards 
¾ 
These cards are represented as “Own Competences” 
and it allows students to perform extra-powerful 
specialties illustrated in each card only once. There 
are many types of cards such as following, for 
instance. 
 
New Interconnection 
z 
Permitting to interconnect with one partner from 
other group members. If successfully, they can 
cooperate with each other during interconnection. 
And this linkage can also enrich them to adapt 
more than disconnection. Of course, as you still 
realized, this card is represented as “Know-Who” 
and human relationship among business partners. 
Literally this interlink implies interconnection 
among experts like LLP and internet based 
partners. 
 
Void of Interconnection 
z 
Canceling and disconnecting an interconnection 
between already interlinked groups. When you 
have this card, you can obstacle for any other 
group 
opponents 
and 
interlinks. 
It 
means 
cooperation and competitions in business process. 
 
Rewiring Interconnection 
z 
Permitting to rewire with an existing node and 
new node. It likes Watts’s Small World model. 
When you have this card, you can take a node 
between any other group opponents and interlinks 
by force. It means cooperation and competitions in 
business process. 
 
Assigning Extra Tasks 
z 
As you have this card, you can force an opponent 
to draw extra task cards from a deck of task cards. 
So then, this opponent will not be able to finish 
faster than your group. 
 
And a lot of ability cards. 
 
Participatory students cooperate with each other among in-
group members in order to achieve own assigned tasks in 
this process of gaming collaborative learning. Further they 
strategically decide how to interconnect with other group 
partners and be competitive against other groups. Through 
gaming process, participants can discuss their assignments 
in belonged group and behave competitively among other 
groups. They also can obtain and interexchange cards and 
Points with other out-group partners in classroom and 
business workspaces if possible. And they often access 
internet resource and database in order to accomplish their 
assignments. Finally, the most performed group that 
finished faster than any other groups and obtained by totally 
Points will be a champion in gaming.  
As figure 1 illustrated a part of gaming process in the 
condition using computational services, contacting partners 
as appropriate ‘Know-what’ and ‘Know-who’ nodes who are 
reliable experts is a foundation of ubiquitous jigsaw using 
mobile devices in a socially networked relation if possible. In 
addition, I would like to explore the way in which these 
social network structures can emerge. Social relationships 
have been considered as a kind of ‘small world phenomenon’ 
[15]. Collective dynamics of social network and its ‘small 
world’ patterns may also appear in collaborative learning 
networks. Sharing and diffusing experiential knowledge is 
easier than in a regular network structure if a small world 
structure can be found everywhere. Furthermore, appropriate 
social networks can lend the comfort of educational support 
to solve problems and understand unfamiliar things. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1:  Testing for Interpersonal Networks 
 
As you can easier imagine a business model like LLP, 
various linkages as interconnected networks among experts 
holding high professional skill and competences will be good 
leading for taking-off own business. Therefore, the current 
design of experiential collaboration paved the way to 
facilitate understanding and acquiring fundamental business 
skills and abilities for students. 
B. Clalifying Experiential Data 
Methodology has to equip own standard and procedure for 
application, utilization and evaluation. This collaborative 
gaming should be also institutionalized the canonical way. 
Especially, data quantification for evaluation is certainly 
significant for the quality control of gaming. So, I have been 
conducting to standardize a first version of this collaborative 
gaming in various conditions and small-groups (three or five 
Japanese participants in each group).  
Here, the most importance is that survey and observation 
data in this gaming can be examined in terms of the Top Ten 
Open Research Questions proposed by experimental 
economist Camerer,C.F [3]. These questions were originally 
game theoretical bases, but it is able to apply widely toward 
social experimental studies. And especially his cast question 
5, 8, 9 and 10 are relevant to the specification of Ubiquitous 
Jigsaw. Namely this collaboration consists of participants’ 
cognitive decision making, heterogeneous memberships as 
team work, solving complicated educational assignments and 
multicultural differences. Other collaboration and gaming 
were not able to clarify participants’ mental factors properly. 
As analyzed results in terms of considerable questions, it 
 
223
UBICOMM 2010 : The Fourth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2010               ISBN: 978-1-61208-100-7

could unveil a part of participants’ cognitive and behavioral 
factors more detail. 
5.What exactly are people thinking in games? 
8.How do teams, groups, and firms play games? 
9.How do people behave in very complex games? 
10.How do socio-cognitive dimensions influence behavior 
in games? 
After this gaming, I could verify the experiential results 
such as quality data that observed participants’ activities in 
gaming and quantity data by few answers in survey after 
gaming. And many of them felt performed well, and I got 
answers that they could almost understand the nature of 
collaboration by means of this gaming. Hence, these data of 
results could shed light on the top ten questions as I listed 
above. 
Further I have a plan to translate the cards of this gaming 
for multilingual version (current version is almost written in 
Japanese). And I will prepare both printed cards and 
electrical online ones to attempt for pupils in developing and 
developed countries and multicultural contexts in future 
works. 
C. Discussion 
 The nature of this collaborative gaming will be also adapted 
interoperating pervasively. This thinking paradigm exactly 
matches with open innovations in business. That is because 
business models such as LLP and internet based business are 
realized as interlinks of many expertise across professionals. 
And any business scenes can not be imaged without any 
networking and interactively skills. And computational 
architecture and massive educational contents has been 
decreasing its costs, and many of these services will be 
provided freely by cloud computing or online resources in 
business.  
The ubiquity is freely and openly to access various chances 
and resources in networked communities for citizens of all 
over the worlds. The highest merit of this gaming 
collaboration can be practiced to open easier participation for 
youth, pupils and any citizens without any expensive devices 
and difficult constraints for learning opportunities. It is the 
very good fit for pupils’ preliminary literacy education either 
with or without touching mobile device. And in developing 
countries, poor pupils can learn by the reasonable 
alternatives using cards. Of course, when participants can 
ideally receive supports by available ubiquitous computing, 
it can nourish more vivid experience for students and 
business people. 
V. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Ubiquitous collaboration should be achieved by pervasively 
children and business people in not relation to their socio-
economical conditions. This ubiquity is freely and openly to 
access various chances and resources in networked 
communities for global citizens. New business and 
knowledge-intensive economy can be engendered by these 
active people. In this concern, I have discussed needs, 
backgrounds, design, and practices of gaming collaboration 
for educing business senses by the Ubiquitous Jigsaw. 
Business education and organizational development will be 
possibly constituted in experiential daily process. These 
actual experiences of collaborative activities can give 
chances of social adaptation for people in actual contexts of 
social relationships. And finally I am willing to lead studies 
on discussed matters in future works.
