Abstract—This article deals with a new method of theoretical
and
practical
training
for
professional
qualification
examination to obtain a gun license in the Czech Republic.
When using the new method of teaching and training, the
shooting accuracy is assessed as one number; this number
contains the information of the capability of a shooter to hit the
assigned part of a target from the short-term perspective as
well as from the long-term perspective.

INTRODUCTION
Shooting a firearm is a test of a shooter’s sensor and
motor performance; the shooter is required to accurately hit
an assigned target. Trained shooters are able to fulfill such a
task due to their ability to attain an appropriate shooting
pose,
to
concentrate
sufficiently,
to
aim
the
firearm
accurately and to master the finger movement while pulling
the trigger and during the shot itself. Hit accuracy is a
suitable criterion for the assessment of the shooter’s success.
A number of methods for hit accuracy assessment have
been described in available literature. Such methods use, for
example, average radius, R50 circle, R100 circle, 2R100
circle,
plain
sum
of
values,
standard
deviation
and,
eventually, estimated universe standard deviation, the ellipsis
of dispersion, probability of the hit, etc.
The method introduced in this article is a suitable
supplement for the above mentioned traditional methods of
assessment for the needs of the Firearm License applicants
training. It is a method of shooting accuracy assessment
where one number rates the ability to hit the assigned part of
a target (for the purpose of the competence test training, in
particular) and to hit the scoring rings; all of it from the
short-term (immediate) as well as from the long-term
perspective. The method it based on specification of the
Series Shooting Capability Index (SSCI) and the Process
Shooting Capability Index (PSCI).
II.
SHOOTING CAPABILITY
A. The Competence Test
While sitting for the competence test, the applicant is
required to hit the assigned target with the assigned number
of hits. The hit must be aimed and carried out within the
previously specified part of the target. For example, the
international pistol target 50/20 is being used while handguns
are being fired; shooting is carried out from the distances of
10 or 15 meters. A great number of forces influence the
bullet trajectory; this shows in fact, that the hit points are
variable and do not exactly correspond to the point being
aimed at. Thus, every process of shooting shows a certain
degree of consistency (or inconsistency).
B. The Variability
The term shooting process capability represents the
shooters’ ability to consistently hit the assigned target. Three
capability indices are proposed for the use of the shooting
capability evaluation:
•
The Series Shooting Capability Index (SSCI)
s
dC ,
which evaluates the capability in the process of
shooting one series; the conditions of shooting do
not change during the course of the series;
•
The Process Shooting Capability Index (PSCI)
p
dC , which assesses the shooters’ ability to hit the
assigned target from the long-term perspective. The
Process Shooting Capability Index must be set on
the basis of the results of several series (minimum
of 25 series). The conditions of shooting change in
an anticipated way (for example the time devoted
to shooting a single series, temperature and other
characteristics of the environment, etc.) within the
time when the minimal number of series will be
carried out.
The Process Shooting Capability Index (PSCI)
t
dC
(assessed
from
several
series)
evaluates
the
shooters’
permanent (long-term) ability to fulfil the given shooting
performance in a given time (minimal permissible time span
of shooting).
III.
SERIES SHOOTING CAPABILITY INDEX
We suggest using the capability index Cs for evaluation
of the shooting process within one series; that is a short-term
process shooting capability. The above mentioned index may
be expressed as a ratio of requirement for a target and the
consistency within the shooting process
y within a process
consistenc
requirement for target
Cs =

Requirement for a target represents the required outcome
of the shooting process, that is, usually the type of target
and its size. Consistency of the shooting process is defined
by an interval which includes all the shots’ scores. In case
the consistency is subject to a normal dispersion, such
intervals may be defined as a multiple of standard deviation
s. If we were to evaluate the consistency of the shooting
process using the interval ± 1.s (standard deviation), 68.27
% of hits’ scores would fall within this interval. If the
interval was ± 2.s, the consistency of the shooting process
would be related to 95.45 % of all the hits’ scores. If the
interval was ± 3.s, the consistency of the shooting process
would be related to 99.73 % of all the hits’ scores. The
interval (± 3. s) is suggested to become a standard for the
consistency evaluation of the shooting process. Such
intervals represent the measure which may be perceived as
accurate enough for the evaluation of the shooting process
quality (that means a sure target hit). The term process
shooting capability in one series represents the shooters’
ability to hit the required target with all shots within the
given series.
A statistical data normality check must be carried out
after the adjustment of all hits’ scores acquired from the
performed shots (concordance of the measured data with the
normal dispersion test). In case of non-refusal of the
hypothesis that the consistency of the shots is a subject of
normal dispersion, we may define the estimate of the Process
Shooting Capability Index Cs for the assessed series by the
following formula
s
Cs
6
ˆ = requirement
(2)
where
s
represents the standard deviation within the
shooting process of one series. The requirement for hits may
be expected to have the shape of a circular scoring ring with
the diameter T.
If the coordinates of the hits being shot
from the distance d are marked with the symbols
d x
and
d y
, the value of the hit radius r
d
may be determined
according to formula (3). The hit radius represents the
distance of a given hit from the target point (decision point
specified in the certain part of a target, in this case, in the
center shooting ring).

The Process Shooting Capability Index is defined by
formula (7) where
r

is the median of the
radius of the hits achieved from a given distance d; it is
calculated from “m” series (each of the series consists of an
identical number of shots) by the formula
(8)
and
p
d s
is the standard deviation of the radius of
the hits in the shooting process; the shooting is carried out
from the distance d. To enumerate the standard deviation of
the shooting process from the distance d, formula (9) is used
(9)
where
R
d
is the average dispersion of the values in
the radius of hits; it is calculated from all evaluated series. k
is the statistical constant number dependent on the number
of executed shots n in the given series (number of shots in
the series). The values of constant k are stated in Table II.
These are valid for 2 -15 shots in an individual series.

TIME SHOOTING CAPABILITY INDEX
When sitting for the competence test, the ultimate time
span for shooting a particular kind of firearm is specified for
each group of Firearm License; the lengths of the time spans
may be found in Table III.
May the symbol t
d
represent the time of shooting (given
in seconds) carried out from the distance d. We may assume
that the time span for the shooting performance of a
particular shooter, carried out from the distance d, will have
normal placement with the median
t

and the standard
deviation
t
ds . The Time Shooting Capability Index is
defined by the formula

CAPABILITY INDICES INTERPRETATION
The statistical importance of the capability indices is that
every single value of the index represents the probability of
a shot being placed within the assigned area (as long as
shooting time span being evaluated does not exceed the
assigned time). First of all, the importance of the capability
index with the value being equal to 1 will be clarified (
s
dC  
= 1,00, or
p
dC  = 1,00). It means that, in the given example,
we place exactly 3 standard deviations of the shooting
process to the formula
r
T
− d
.5,0
(T represents, for
example, the diameter of the largest ring of the pistol target
50/20.)
In this case, the probability of the target miss equals to
1-F(3) = 0.00135, where F(3) represents the value of the
distribution function of the standardized normal dispersion
in three standard deviations.
In other words, the probability that the radius of the hits
will be larger than 0.5T is 0.135 %. This means that only
one hit out of one thousand hits (thirteen out of ten
thousand, etc.) will not fall within the scoring rings of the
5/20 target.
In general, the procedure of interpretation is as follows.
We ask: what multiple of the standard deviation of the
radius
of
the
hits
may
be
placed
within
the
space
r
T
− d
.5,0
? The symbol u represents such a multiple
and it is defined by one of the following formulas
(17)
The probability of the target miss will thus be equal to

These are: shooter, firearm, ammunition, accessories,
situation, method and the environment [6]. These factors
determine the outcome of the shooting. The shooter is a
main critical element of the shooting result [7]. His mental
and physical condition, level of knowledge and training
decides.
Fig 2: Method of training [7]
Important properties of the weapon are its purpose, size,
weight, magazine capacity, user simplicity. Ammunition
must meet the characteristics such as security, reliability,
quality of processing and efficiency. Basic equipment for
the shooter is as holster, belt, eye and ear protection,
clothing, etc. (Figure 2.)
Fig 3: Method of shooting [8]
Each training situation may be different. The first time it
is important to practice on site. Next step is changing of the
shooting position and movement. There are many ways and
methods of shooting [8]. Some examples of shooting
methods include: two-handed, one-handed, with use of
cover, etc. (Figure 3.) The environment influences the
solution of the situation in professional defense in the form
of location (city, apartment, park, crowd, public transport,
restaurant, etc.), season and time of the day (snow, rain,
wind, ice, dawn, fog, etc.) and inspection (witnesses,
cameras, media, etc.) (Figure 4.) [9]. These basic elements
of professional defense work together; the orders may
change in each situation.
Fig 4: Factors influencing the solution of defensive situation [9]
To successfully meet the objectives of professional
defense, one needs to be part of the Commercial Security
Industry workers (hereinafter CSI). This special requirement
includes broadband knowledge and skills. Part of the remit
employee CSI who use a weapon for their work is defined in
terms of reliability in hitting the target. To evaluate the
success of hitting, only three classic ways are currently
used. Due to both current and prospective conditions of
using weapons in defense, it is appropriate to supplement a
new method of evaluation, focusing primarily on reliability
intervention. This method allows for assessment in terms of
a single intervention or series of interventions, as well as the
short and long terms, or in terms of time. Everything is
expressed by a single number. The new evaluation of
competence of shooting will be useful both for regular staff
evaluation, eventually for the appropriateness of including
them to task or job. The industry of commercial security
services includes a range of security nature, which includes
personnel performing duties with a gun. Currently, training
with weapons is implemented according to the law on
weapons and, beyond the law, training is left to the
discretion of private security service or to the self-
employed. Evaluation of shooting is currently being carried
out by the basic methods of evaluation. A new method for
evaluating the reliability of the shooting using an eligibility
index leads to increase quality of service and enhanced
professionalism in the use of weapons in the CSI.

CONCLUSION
This article presents one way of evaluating the shooting
success. The method may be used while evaluating the
competence tests of the Firearm License applicants. The
method is based on calculation of the Series Shooting
Capability Index and Process Shooting Capability Index.
These two indices are further complemented by the Time
Shooting Capability Index. This method is suitable for the
evaluation of individual shooting series as well as for the
long-term evaluation of the competence test training. The
above described method represents a brand new complex
attitude to the evaluation of the shooting process. Such a
method has already been used in the industrial field, but it
has never been applied to the field of firearms shooting
evaluation. The shooting evaluation method (using the three
capability indices) widens the range of other, already
existing, methods of evaluation. Its viability may only be
verified by the actual use of the method.
