INTRODUCTION
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI) explains electronic (digital) signature as “essentially
the equivalent of a hand-written signature, with data in
electronic form being attached to other electronic subject
data (Invoice, Payment slip, Contract, etc.) as a means of
authentication”
[1].
EU
Regulation
on
Electronic
Identification and Trust Services (EU Regulation 910/2014
of 23 July 2014, eIDAS) states that an electronic signature is
“data in electronic form which is attached to or logically
associated with other data in electronic form and which is
used by the signatory to sign” [2].
eIDAS differentiates electronic signatures, Advanced
Electronic
Signatures
(AES),
and
Qualified
Electronic
Signatures (QES). An Advanced Electronic Signature is used
under control of the signatory, it identifies the signatory, and
it is associated with the signatory without any uncertainty. It
can be used to show if the signed content has been changed.
A Qualified Electronic Signature creation device creates a
QES, which can legally replace a handwritten signature. All
EU countries should recognize QES based on a qualified
certificate and issued by a qualified trust service provider.
The provider should be listed on the European Trusted List
[3]. A qualified certificate for electronic signatures holds
data that clearly represents the qualified trust service
provider and the natural or legal person. An electronic record
signed with QES should not require supplementary evidence
in courts. This represents a giant step forward for using
electronically signed records and working paperless in the
EU. EU has also launched an eSignature building block
through its Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) instrument to
facilitate the use of electronic signature [4]. eSignature
building block helps IT-solution providers to develop their
solutions in conformance with eIDAS regulation. ETSI
provides
a
free
online
tool
for
electronic
signature
conformance verification [5].
The Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices
(HALMED) is the Croatian authority in charge of the
regulation and services related to medicinal products,
medical devices, homeopathic medicinal products, and
veterinary medicinal products. HALMED is responsible for
permitting marketing authorizations for the registration of
medicinal products and homeopathic medicinal products, for
parallel
imports
of
medicinal
products,
for
granting
authorizations for manufacturers of medicinal products, for
granting
authorizations
for
wholesale
distribution
of
medicinal products, for brokering of medicinal products, and
for the retail sale of medical devices. HALMED performs
laboratory analyses of medical devices and quality control
procedures
for
medicinal
products
and
homeopathic
medicinal products as the official laboratory for the Republic
of Croatia. It is responsible for the inspection of the
production of active substances, excipients, and finished
medicinal products. It approves the entry and import of
medicinal products. It monitors adverse reactions in clinical
trials
and
on
the
marketed
products,
and
conducts
pharmacovigilance of medicinal products and vigilance of
medical
devices.
HALMED
also
advises
marketing
authorization holders, the Minister of Health, and the public,
and cooperates with other EU and international medical
agencies within its scope of work as well [6].
In Section II of this paper, we describe processes with
electronic signatures in HALMED. In Section III, we
discuss the solution and standards that it uses, from both
practical
and
scientific
viewpoint.
Further
work
and
conclusion are provided in Sections IV and V.
II.
PROCESSES IN HALMED WITH ELECTRONIC
SIGNATURES
For the time being, HALMED has implemented a general
signing procedure with electronic signatures. That means that
any record can be signed in its Windows environment as
long as it is saved in PDF form (as shown in Fig. 1).
The solution for signing records enables HALMED’s
employees to verify signatures and signed records. This is
the standard function of eSignature software solutions [7].
The next upgrade of this solution should enable the
electronic signing of any record in MS Word or PDF directly
from HALMED’s Digital Archival Information System’s
(DAIS) environment. This functionality is in the early testing
phase. DAIS should automatically convert MS Word records
to PDFs before signing. The solution is currently used with

internal certificates, issued by HALMED’s organization to
its employees, but it can work with any certificate for
qualified electronic signatures. The solution was tested with
several Croatian trusted certificates. However, to work
paperless,
HALMED
should
digitally
transform
its
processes.
Figure 1. The process of signing records in the Windows environment.
Next, we describe and explain the IT solution for
electronic signatures installed in HALMED more closely.
III.
SOLUTION FOR SIGNING WITH ELECTRONIC
SIGNATURE IMPLEMENTED IN HALMED
The IT solution for electronic signatures in HALMED
was developed and provided by Ericsson Nikola Tesla
company (ENT, www.ericsson.hr). ENT has been working
closely with HALMED on various occasions. This IT
company won the EU-financed project of developing
HALMED’s DAIS in 2013. This IT solution for signing
electronic records represents a logical upgrade of DAIS. The
signing solution was based on CEF eSignature building
block to ensure its compatibility with eIDAS regulation and
to decrease the level of legal risk in HALMED’s work with
electronically signed records.
CEF eSignature building block was provided to assist
“public administrators and businesses to accelerate the
creation and verification of electronic signatures” [8]. The
eSignature
building
block
was
established
upon
the
following standards [9]-[13]:

ETSI EN 319 132 XML Advanced Electronic
Signatures (XAdES)

ETSI EN 319 122 CMS Advanced Electronic
Signatures (CAdES)

ETSI EN 319 142 PDF Advanced Electronic
Signature Profiles (PAdES)

ETSI
EN
319
162 Associated
Signature
Containers (ASiC)

ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1 Electronic Signatures
and Infrastructures (ESI), Trusted Lists
The building block includes Digital Signature Services
(DSS), open-source software for the creation and validation
of
eIDAS-conformant
electronic
signatures.
IT-solution
providers can use DSS according to the GNU Lesser General
Public Licence 2.1. The current DSS version is 5.5 [14].
The IT solution for signing electronic records works with
certificates compatible with RFC 5280 and X509 standard,
RFC 7292 and PKCS#12/Personal Exchange File (PFX)
standards [15]- [16]. The procedural and technological basis
for
working
with
electronic
signature
is
Public
Key
Infrastructure (PKI). PKI connects public keys with natural
or legal subjects via registration procedure. X509 is a
standard
that
determines
public
key
certificates
and
revocation lists. PKCS#12 is used for the binding of various
cryptography objects, like private keys and certificates, to a
file.
The IT solution for electronic signatures enables using
internal or other certificates, e.g., certificates issued by a
trusted service, as well as choosing a business role or a
reason for signing an electronic record [17]. This is the first
advantage of the solution; it can work with various
certificates. Certificates should be compatible with X509,
RFC 5280, PKCS#12 and PFX standards. The solution in its
web-part uses RFC 8446 Transport Layer Security (TLS)
cryptographic protocol for safe communication over the
internet [18]. The solution also contains its local installation.
As the web part of the solution communicates with the
service installed locally, the TLS certificate should be issued
for the localhost domain. The solution adds the table with
data about signing and the signer at the end of the records. A
property file contains definitions of signatories’ roles, and an
administrator in HALMED can change this file. The table
contains the following data: signatory, role, date, time, and
time zone.
DAIS is a wide-range IT system and HALMED’s digital
archives, developed by ENT for HALMED under the EU-
financed project in 2013 and 2014. It was established on the
IBM FileNet platform, and it contains several modules. The
basic module is Content Navigator; it enables working with
any electronic records and starting various record-driven
processes (see Fig. 2 that shows the folder view and
organization in HALMED’s DAIS, and the folder in the
example contains action plans and analyses records).

The second module is Enterprize Records. Enterprize
Records is a records management and archival management
module, and it is connected with HALMED’s archival
(metadata) management system Pismohrana (the Archive).
IT Company Omega-Software developed Pismohrana in
2012
(www.omega-software.hr).
It
is
a
process-driven
application
based
on
professional
standards
of
the
International Council of Archives (www.ica.org/en). The
purpose of the DAIS Enterprize Records module is to
capture archival metadata from Pismohrana application and
protect the records, or to execute an activity upon the
records, triggered by Pismohrana application. Enterprize
Records module works with EMC2 (from the names of the
IT company founders Egan, Marino, Conolly, and Curly)
Isilon archival storage and moves archived records from
active HP 3PAR storage to slower, but more protected Isilon
storage. DAIS also works with an integrated PDF/A file
converter.
The third module is a module for ingest of ISO 14721-
compatible [19] submitted packages with records and their
metadata into the DAIS repository (see Fig. 3 that shows the
analysis, migration and export of packages functions). By
using this module, records are prepared for description in
Pismohrana application and transported into the DAIS
repository, and their metadata are transferred and linked to
newly-established digital objects in the repository. Metadata
are used for the retrieval and management of archived
records.
Figure 3. The migration module.
The fourth module is related to business processes and
management of workflows. The next module is a module
related to the creation and management of HALMED’s
Quality Management System. This module enables the role-
defined creation of Standard Operative Procedure (SOP)
records and related templates and reports. It notifies SOP
authors and their managers when an SOP needs to be
reviewed and updated and enables automated distribution
and archiving of new versions upon their completion.
HALMED’s employees are signing new SOPs by using the
previously developed functionality of signing electronic
records. This functionality works with the same internal
certificates.
The
difference
is
related
to
the
visual
appearance of the table with signatures and the fact that it is
placed at the beginning of the record (see Fig. 4 and 5 - Fig.
shows the header of SOP records’ template).
Figure 4. Table for signatures in an SOP record.
Figure 5. The role-dependent signing of SOP records in the Quality
Management module, by using integrated functionality for signing
electronic records.
The next module is used for the administration of
HALMED’s internal projects, like the development and
customizations of business applications, digitization, and
other projects. The signing function is not integrated with
this module, but HALMED has developed plans to enable
electronic signatures in this module in the next few years. In
this time, HALMED’s project managers and the members of
the groups for the supervision of HALMED’s projects use
the signing functionality in the Windows environment, as
shown in Fig. 1. Finally, there is a module for the
administration of the DAIS system and its users.
IV.
FURTHER WORK
The near phase of development of HALMED’s options
with electronic signatures comes down to the implementation
180

eTELEMED 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

of electronic signature across the DAIS environment, i.e.,
across all modules except the admin module. The ability to
use the solution across at least two different environments is
the second advantage. Various business applications (for
approval of medicines, for medical devices, for inspections)
connect with DAIS, so the solution should automatically
facilitate electronic signatures in these specific business
environments.
Figure 6. Signing of an electronic record in the DAIS pre-production
environment (figure taken from the functional specification).
Ericsson Nikola Tesla developed this functionality of
signing in DAIS for HALMED, and currently, it is in the
testing phase. Fig. 6, taken from Ericsson Tesla’s functional
specification, shows the selection of record, signer’s role,
and a certificate from the list of available certificates. Fig. 7
shows the saving of electronically signed records as the main
version in the DAIS repository. However, solely the
implementation of electronic signature across the entire
DAIS system will not enable HALMED to work paperless.
Figure 7. Saving the electronically signed record as the new main version, a
figure from the functional specification.
The plans for further development include business
process
reengineering
for
main
HALMED’s
business
processes, starting with granting marketing authorization for
medicinal products. For this reason, HALMED has gathered
a group dedicated to turning the marketing authorization
process more comfortable for its clients and its employees.
The final goal is to make this process completely paperless.
The components of the digital transformation of HALMED’s
marketing authorization process are the following:

Reengineering of the business process. The re-
engineered
and
streamlined
marketing
authorization process should be established
upon new activities with electronic records and
resources, and these activities cannot “mimic”
the existing paper-based process.

HALMED
representatives
with
process-
significant roles should be equipped with legally
valid certificates.

Marketing
authorization
holders
(as
HALMED’s clients) need to be prepared for the
new processes. For this reason, HALMED
works on establishing a registration procedure
and portal for its clients. Further guidelines
should be produced for the clients in the next
period.

Supportive
resources
should
also
exist
in
electronic form. This has already been ensured
on the EU-level as the dossiers for medicinal
products are being created and transferred to
medicines agencies in the electronic Common
Technical
Document
(eCTD)
format
[20].
HALMED has actively participated in this EU
initiative since 2008, it has enabled work with
electronic eCTD resources since 2010 on the
national level, and since 2013 on the EU level.

DAIS should enable archiving the electronically
signed records. Additional customization of
DAIS was planned for the 2020/2021 period.
The debate is run on possible utilization of
blockchain and distributed ledger technologies
for ensuring the information on the authenticity
of electronically signed records in a particular
period [21] [22].
Another example of the digital transformation of the
business process, which occurs in HALMED right now, is
the reengineering of the support process related to employee
vacations. For this reason, HALMED has initiated the
customization of its ERP and HR (Human Resources) system
(developed by the local company Irata, www.irata.hr). This
process will also use electronically signed records.
V.
CONCLUSION
HALMED has taken the preliminary step when enabling
the functionality of electronic signing. The solution is based
on the CEF eSignature building block, it is compatible with
EU practice, and it works with various certificates. The
innovative application of relevant standards and the usability

on Windows and FileNet primary platforms, as well as on
HALMED’s business platforms, represent both the scientific
and practical contribution to the electronic signature subject
matter. After the digital transformation of the marketing
authorization process, what HALMED is currently solving,
other core and support processes will follow. Establishing
the generic process of signing electronic records is not
sufficient for the successful functioning of a paperless
organization
–
the
complete
digital
transformation
of
selected business processes should be performed. In this
sense, technology can assist the digital transformation of an
organization, but the actual work on the processes cannot be
dodged.
