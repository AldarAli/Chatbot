Abstract—This paper presents the results from creating and
using long-term knowledge resources for knowledge processing
by employing a universal classiﬁcation. The knowledge objects
can further comprise specialised research data collections and
refer to any kind of multi-disciplinary data. The resources can be
sustainably used for documentation, universal classiﬁcation, and
structuring as well as with scientiﬁc supercomputing resources for
advanced information systems, supporting discovery and decision
making. The case study discusses selected examples from the
geosciences context. Within the case studies the structure of the
resources and the Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) has
been used together with spatial information in order to handle
and support workﬂows and visualisations for multi-disciplinary
data and features. Implementations of various components have
been created for discovery and development using dynamical,
interactive, and batch computing and storage resources in an
Integrated Information and Computing System environment
exploiting High End Computing (HEC) and High Performance
Computing (HPC) resources and UDC. The paper discusses the
new results and practical cases regarding a multi-disciplinary
geosciences, volcanology, and spatial features scenario from long-
term knowledge resources.

INTRODUCTION
Geoscientiﬁc knowledge processing is traditionally focussed
on processing and analysis of data resulting from geophysical
or geological measurements. Examples are processing based
on seismological, seismic, magnetic, or gravimetric data. The
amount of information and documentation from geosciences
and natural sciences based methods and features as well as
their complexity has steadily increased for decades. Efﬁciency
and economical practice forces to long-term document and
exploit this pool of multi-disciplinary information. Spatial
and chronological data and classiﬁcation are an indispensable
component. It is becoming increasingly important that with
most professional analysis different geophysical methods and
results have to be used in combination.
Common means of application and knowledge discovery,
e.g., isolated batch or interactive application scenarios or string
based search routines on plain data cannot even approximately
integrate the required higher complexity of real environments.
The knowledge gathered during generations should be con-
sidered the most valuable component, the more important for
long-term results from geosciences. The universal knowledge
resources require long-term documentation as well as universal
classiﬁcation and structuring, beyond traditional collections,
digital libraries and isolated content [1], [2]. With the long-
term multi-disciplinary resources the high end processing
and computing aspects are essential for sustainability and
discovery. Therefore, it is recommended to implement sci-
entiﬁc supercomputing resources supporting advanced infor-
mation systems and creating and improving workﬂows as
recommended [3] with Integrated Information and Computing
System (IICS) components and High End Computing (HEC)
[4]. This paper presents the results from creating and managing
long-term knowledge resources for knowledge processing by
employing a universal classiﬁcation like the Universal Decimal
Classiﬁcation (UDC) [5]. It discusses the experiences handling
systematics and classiﬁcation as well as the methodological use
of “Object Carousels”. The paper points out the demands and
challenges as resulting from the case studies within the GEXI
collaborations [6] concentrating on integrating knowledge from
geosciences, volcanology, and spatial sciences disciplines.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II introduces
the previous work and components used, Sections III and
IV present the systematics and classiﬁcation used for the
processing, and discuss the results from the implementation
case study, Sections V and VI evaluate main results, and
summarise the lessons learned, conclusions and future work.

COMPONENTS EMPLOYED
The data used here is based on the content and context
from the LX Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources [7], [8]. The LX
structure and UDC [5], [9] are an essential means for the pro-
cessing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge objects and
containers. The applied workﬂows and processing are based
on the data and extended features developed for the Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz resources [10]. The classiﬁcation is state-of-
the-art within the knowledge resources, which implicitly means
that the classiﬁcation is not created statically or even ﬁxed.
It can be used and dynamically be modiﬁed on the ﬂy, e.g.,
when required by a knowledge discovery workﬂow description.
Representations and references can be handled dynamically
with the context of a discovery process. So, the classiﬁcation
can be dynamically modelled with the context of the workﬂow.
The LX resources can provide any knowledge documentation
and additional information on objects as well as, e.g., geo-
and knowledge references. The volcanological data used in

the examples is embedded into millions of multi-disciplinary
objects, dynamical and spatial information and data ﬁles.
The knowledge objects are under continuous development
for more than twenty-ﬁve years. The classiﬁcation information
has been added in order to describe the objects with the ongo-
ing research and in order to enable more detailed documenta-
tion in a multi-disciplinary context. The knowledge resources
can make sustainable and vital use of Object Carousels [11] in
order to create knowledge object references and to modularise
the required algorithms [12]. This provides a universal means
for improving coverage, e.g., dark data, and quality within the
workﬂow. Therefore, for the cases presented in this research
paper we had to concentrate on the structure of the knowledge
objects, georeferencing, and references data. As secondary
components, besides IICS applications and interfaces are avail-
able, allowing parallel workﬂows and intelligent components
on HEC and HPC resources [13], [14]. With the IICS, the
Generic Mapping Tools [15] have been used to visualise geo-
referenced data wherever a spatial representation is reasonable.
III.
DISCIPLINES, SYSTEMATICS, AND PROCESSING
In geosciences, there is no globally unique stratigraphy.
Different continents and regions require different and detailed
stratigraphies. Therefore, it is not practicable to have a ﬂat
unique global standard due to the regional differences in ge-
ological development. Present common stratigraphy concepts
[16] fail on general use as well as on a consistent universal
classiﬁcation required. Implementing a universal long-term
use we further need to consider appropriate systematics, e.g.,
lithostratigraphical, chronological, biostratigraphical, chrono-
metrical, chronostratigraphical systematics. For example when
it comes to plants, animals, and genotype “-zoic”, “-phytic”
or “-gen” often mix without distinction. Instead of a mix-
up of terminology, for systematical use the alignment of the
Eonothems/Eons, Erathems/Eras, Systems/Periods, Series/E-
pochs, and Stages/Ages and so on should be handled con-
sistently and consequently. In addition, the multi-regional di-
mension should be available for these, showing correspondence
with the appropriate absolute ages, as available on-site.
For an efﬁcient and effective processing the knowledge data
requires a ﬂexible structure and a universal systematic classiﬁ-
cation. Any knowledge resources documenting complex multi-
disciplinary reality for discovery applications require features
for exact documentation on the one hand and they require soft
criteria on the other hand. UDC is a classiﬁcation complying
with the classiﬁcation criteria. Together with the content,
which may deliver more detail or differing perspectives UDC
provides a universal view on the classiﬁed objects. When
requiring facetted classiﬁcation for multi-disciplinary knowl-
edge the universal UDC cannot be ignored as it is the most
comprehensive and ﬂexible means available and supported.
With the knowledge resources in this research handling 70000
classes, for 100000 objects and several million referenced data
the algorithms are mostly non-linear. They allow interactive
use, dynamical communication, computing, decision support,
and pre- and postprocessing, e.g., visualisation.
The classiﬁcation deployed for documentation [17] is able
to document any object with any relation, structure, and level
of detail as well as intelligently selected nearby hits and
references. Objects include any media, textual documents,
illustrations, photos, maps, videos, sound recordings, as well
as realia, physical objects such as museum objects. UDC
is a suitable background classiﬁcation, for example: The
objects use preliminary classiﬁcations for multi-disciplinary
content. Standardised operations used with UDC are coordi-
nation and addition (“+”), consecutive extension (“/”), relation
(“:”), order-ﬁxing (“::”), subgrouping (“[]”), non-UDC nota-
tion (“*”), alphabetic extension (“A-Z”), besides place, time,
nationality, language, form, and characteristics.
IV.
CASE STUDY IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
The following sections discusses the work done for using
knowledge resource objects with processing and computing
from within IICS. For knowledge resources it is necessary that
any classiﬁcation can be added while the content is developed,
over long period of time, more than decades. With the cases
presented the content has been created over more than twenty-
ﬁve years. Methodologically, in a ﬁrst phase objects have
been documented without classiﬁcation. In a second phase,
all objects describing volcanic features have been classiﬁed as
volcanic features. In a third phase, volcanic features’ objects
have been classiﬁed into separate classes as required with
ongoing extended description of objects in a multi-disciplinary
context. The case study presents a state-of-the-art selection of
volcanological and geological features. An evaluation of the
association that users have, showed that the criteria “date” and
“location” are most prominent with objects if the workﬂow
approaches from the “surface (of the earth)” view [6]. Mapping
and timelining will be the natural result.

Any of the classiﬁcation can be mapped to speciﬁc content
data. The workﬂows and processing handle different dates
and speciﬁcation between classiﬁcation and content as well as
using equal classiﬁcation elements for different absolute dates,
e.g., as required for different regions or cultures.
3) Results of systematical use: Suitable views for volcanic
features are: Type (of volcano, coarse categories), date on
timeline, size (height). For craters respective views are: Type
(of crater, fragmentary), date on timeline, size (diameter).
Two Object Carousels have been computed. Figure 1 shows
the knowledge resources groups for volcano types, and Fig-
ure 2 provides the geological spaces of time references. For
simplicity only the main groups are shown, subgroups like
for Quarternary “Holocene” and “Pleistocene” create separate
carousels (Figure 3). Most geological objects have references
into some instance of these carousels. This enables to create
numberless links to additional information.

The example is the “Tertiary” classiﬁcation development
within different UDC editions. The table shows that the target
not only moved (a) → (b) within the classiﬁcation but
was also adapted to a new subgrouping (lower block). The
currently ﬁnal result is a composite classiﬁcation, composing
from geology and time, holding both Tertiary and Cenozoic.
UDC still not considers different stratigraphies in plain.

common system (top) as well as for an alternative system

It compiles a small excerpt of computed data from the LX
resources [7]. The table delivers comprehensive information
for the volcanological topics integrated here: Volcanic feature
types, computed groups, UDC mappings, and examples of
computed references, e.g., Volcano Number (VNUM) the
volcanic reference ﬁle number, geo-coordinates and spatial
data, and spaces of time, as well as referenced data, e.g.,
the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) [21]. The full result
matrix for this request contains several hundreds of computed
objects with tenthousands of references. A container represents
a collection of equally structured groups of related objects on
a certain topic. In addition, in depth completion within object
containers has been enabled for the case of volcanological
features. The resources further allow for a ﬂexible mapping
of attributes, e.g., container relations, classiﬁcation, keywords,
numbers, references, media samples, material samples, spatial
data, and geological spaces of time. With these references the
volcanological features can be associated with a VEI, e.g.,
Vesuvius (Pompeii) VEI5, Krakatau VEI6, Tambora VEI7,
Thera (Santorini) VEI7, Toba (Sumatra) VEI8, whereas a
“Caldera” object itself being a crater does not have a VEI. With
existing models used in simulation and modelling there is no
consideration of references between disciplines, e.g., volcanoes
and weather. With the knowledge resources, volcanological
features can be referred to volcanological events, seismological
events, and weather phenomenon events or biology. The larger
the data base is the more correlatable events get available in
space and time. In comparison to mono-disciplinary informa-
tion the multi-disciplinary context of the knowledge resources
supports an improved knowledge description. Further, even
indirect correlation, e.g., in the above case between volcanic
features and meteorite impact features can be investigated.
7) Knowledge generation, combination, and visualisation:
The following visualisation (Figure 7) paradigmatically illus-
trates the results from the compute requests. An on-location at-
tribute has been choosen for the relations in order to compute a
distribution map for volcanic features using the lxlocation
workﬂow. The location attribute is suitable for referring to
an unlimited number of multi-disciplinary information in this
case.
Figure 7. Volcanomap – computed worldwide spatial distribution of
classiﬁed volcanological features from resulting object entries.
The distribution is computed from the result matrix of re-
lated object context of several hundred classiﬁed terrestrial vol-
canic features via the knowledge resources research database.
The result matrix is the result of the present content, references,
and workﬂow. In all examples only an excerpt of these can
be shown. Several modules have been used for this exam-
ple: select_knowledge_environment, lxgrep_udc,
lxkwgrep, generateCarousel, lxvolcanoes2gmt,
cprgmt_world_cprvolcanoes_separated, as well
as pscoast, pstoraster, and psxy. System interfaces
can be created via instructions, programming interfaces, or any
kind of interface the disciplines working on implementations
and suggested workﬂows want to built on top of the knowledge
resources. The workﬂow allows any feature supported by the
deployed components, e.g.,
•
Association by classiﬁcation weighting,
•
Association by grouping,
•
Association by colourisation,
•
Association and by symbolisation.
In this example, colour groups have been computed via the

and several classiﬁcation groups have been choosen for the
result. The map shows the present situation according to the
present state of the available volcanological data. It is possible
to combine any information, e.g., computing a map animation
varying in time, showing the development of volcanic features.

Besides the large requirements per instance with most
workﬂows there are signiﬁcant effects by parallelising even
within single instances. The following issues have shown to
lead to advanced challenges and increased processing and
computational times. Nomenclature, terms, and attributes tend
to be at least partially different in different cultures and
languages. For many discovery workﬂows as well as efforts
to increase the quality of the result matrices it is necessary
to consider more than one culture and language. Processing a
classiﬁcation numbering in decreasing numbering with increas-
ing age or following in different directions is less consequent.
For example, in geosciences it is natural to start spaces of time
with Quarternary, followed by older stratigraphy. In addition
to the existing singular spaces of time mapping most objects
require appropriate different mappings to absolute dates, e.g.,
with Bronze Age having different absolute dates for different
regions or cultures. The calculation with extensive composite
classiﬁcations, facets, and respective ranges instead of native
classiﬁcations can increase the computational requirements
drastically as has been shown with the knowledge content from
the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz resources [10].
V.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION
The Knowledge Oriented Architecture (KOA) of the re-
sources is based on a ﬂexible integration of the documentation
and development architecture utilising the Collaboration house
framework for disciplines, services, and resources [8]. The
knowledge objects, here the geological and volcanic feature
objects, can be used with any of their attributes. Therefore,
any references to objects belonging or referring to any other
objects can be computed from this. For an object referred
to a timescale of periods other objects can be associated
with the respective object, even beyond direct references. For
example, “geological time type” can refer from “volcano type”
to any other suitable for a geological or comparable spaces
of time classiﬁcation. This will, e.g., be true for geophysical,
palaeontological or archaeological objects. Further, volcanic
objects from the Quarternary can be associated to meteorite
impact events from the Quarternary. The more, they can be
restricted to associated objects of a certain attribute, e.g., from
the same region. With secondary steps further information can
be integrated. This can include geophysical data, media data
or associated objects. The resulting quality depends on an
intelligent use of context and classiﬁcation. A strong classiﬁ-
cation support is essential, the more as object and even many
citations, media, and publications are not explicitly aware of
the nomenclature of spaces of time used with speciﬁc content
can, e.g., to express that the spaces of time refer to plants
or animals. Employing a universal classiﬁcation with multi-
disciplinary content this way, e.g., with volcanological content,
expedites knowledge discovery as well as it targets on scientiﬁc
discovery. Regarding methodology it further allows to
•
Support a systematic documentation,
•
Deﬁne a normative classiﬁcation,
•
Deﬁne cognitive interfaces.
Regarding architecture and implementation it allows to
•
Support decision making in complex systems,
•
Implement learning system components and
•
Support components by intelligent systems.
Creating classiﬁed knowledge resources objects has proven
to be most sustainable for a signiﬁcant period of operation
and implementation. It has been efﬁcient and portable with
all application scenarios and environments for more than
two decades, used with ten different operating system envi-
ronments, with different editing components, processing lan-
guages, and compute and storage resources. From classiﬁcation
side it is suggested to have advanced computing support, e.g.,
for spaces of time as well as for the complementary systematics
for disciplines. In addition, a methodological framework for
UDC supporting the required processing and computation
would add immense beneﬁts to its universal applicability.
Some new types of stratigraphies have not widely been adopted
and should again become subject of modiﬁcation regarding
a long-term use. In many cases, the consequence of claims
on consistency has been to use one dedicated edition of
the classiﬁcation. This shall ensure consistency within the
application. Using a small subset of classiﬁcation can help to
reduce the appearent work that has to be done for classiﬁcation
but it cannot ensure to avoid variances in different editions.
Consistent version management support for the classiﬁcation
has shown to become necessary as soon as knowledge re-
sources are using modiﬁed classiﬁcations over time.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The knowledge processing employing UDC classiﬁcation
has shown to be a universal and most ﬂexible solution for cre-
ating long-term multi-disciplinary knowledge resources. The
resources and framework can be used even with basic attributes
and cross-references, and assure support for subsequent use
and knowledge procurement processes. Structuring and classi-
ﬁcation with long-term knowledge resources and UDC support

GEOProcessing 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Applications, and Services

have successfully provided excellent solutions, which can be
used for natural sciences, e.g., geosciences, volcanology or
with spatial disciplines as well as for universal knowledge. The
knowledge resources can provide any kind of Object Carousel
and object references. Decisions can be computed with sup-
port of the UDC classiﬁcation. Due to the universal long-
term multi-disciplinary knowledge gathering, the knowledge
resources are a general universal decision support base.
Besides these, a major beneﬁt of the extensive support of
UDC language translations is that regarding discovery work-
ﬂows it can also be used for improving the quality as well as
the quantity of elements and references in the result matrices.
Employing a universal classiﬁcation when creating knowledge
resources has provided substantial beneﬁt for both. The work-
ﬂow procedures build for special purposes are property of the
researchers and disciplines creating, developing, and operating
their implementations. The data used by them is intended to
be part of the respective collaboration. Currently, if someone
creates data, he or she can use the data and share it with others,
creating agreements and policies. As knowledge resources have
been proven to be a valuable means for research in many
disciplines, components are candidates for community tasks
as well as for open access development and licensing models.
Currently the policies with many collaborations, funding, and
services (as comparable with the UDC model) do not allow
to make sources and content public. Because the process
of creating long-term sustainable content is quite pretentious
and will never be completed there might be support by a
sustainable funding in the future, too.
As presented, the knowledge processing can base on a solid
and sustainable long-term resource, which allows to create any
kind of workﬂows, dynamical discovery, and IICS components
and facilitate the use of High End Computing resources.
