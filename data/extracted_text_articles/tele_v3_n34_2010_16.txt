Abstract—In this paper we have considered the downlink
multimedia transmission with Direct Sequence-Ultra wideband
(DS-UWB) [1] communication system. We have evaluated
performance of DS-UWB system under multiuser scenario. We
have investigated performance of the system under synchronous
and asynchronous transmission. We have discussed the effect
of orthogonal and non-orthogonal code selection with effect of
different UWB pulse selection. Also the performance of DS-
UWB with non-orthogonal code is compared with TH-PAM
UWB [2]. We have considered AWGN and UWB channel model
for simulation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ultra wideband (UWB) was known as Impulse radio [3],
[4] as in principle, it uses the extremely short pulses for high
speed data transmission. UWB promises to provide effective
high speed data transmission in wireless personal area net-
works (WPAN) [5], [6]. In future WPAN networks (IEEE
802.15.3a, IEEE 802.15.4a), UWB will be the candidate at
physical layer for enabling several Mbps data rate, which is
quite higher than Bluetooth’s data rate.
FCC assigned unlicensed spectrum of 3.1 GHz -10.6 GHz
for UWB communication [7]. Signal with the fractional
bandwidth (Bf) of more than 20 % at -10 dB emission
points is considered as a UWB signal. Where fractional
bandwidth is deﬁned as a ratio of signal bandwidth to its
centre frequency. New industrial deﬁnition for UWB signal
is the signal which occupies bandwidth of more than 500
MHz in assigned frequency range, is considered as UWB
signal [7]. For multiple access in UWB literatures [3], [8]
suggest method based on Time Hopping (TH) technique.
This access technique can be used with Pulse Position
Modulation (PPM) or Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)
technique. Depending upon modulation scheme TH UWB
signal is known as TH-PPM UWB [9], [10] or TH-PAM
UWB [2]. Also Direct Sequence UWB (DS-UWB) approach
proposed in [1] is same as TH-PAM UWB except minor
difference. In all TH-UWB method single bit duration (Tb) is
divided into number of frames (Nf) each with equal duration
of (Tf). Further each frame duration (Tf) is divided into
number of chips (Nc) of duration (Tc). During each chip
period (Tc) UWB radio signal, which is Gaussian pulse or
its derivative is transmitted depending upon unique TH code.
UWB signal comprised of sub-nano second duration pulses.
A sequence of pulses (Nf) are used to encode a transmitted
symbol. In TH-PPM, UWB pulse will take additional delay
of δ at the beginning of chip duration when data bit ′1′ is
transmitted. In TH-PAM instead of using shift of δ, antipodal
signal is used for data bit ′1′ and ′0′.
In this paper, we have considered DS-UWB [1] method as
a multiple access technique for multimedia transmission. We
have considered downlink communication under multiuser
environment. In this situation each user signal is identiﬁed
with unique Pseudo random (PN) code. Here we investigated
the performance of multiuser UWB system with DS-UWB
under synchronous and asynchronous transmission. Also the
effect of selection of orthogonal and non-orthogonal code
is discussed with both the transmission schemes. Effect of
selection of UWB pulse shape is discussed. Finally we
have compared performance of DS-UWB multiuser system
with TH-PAM UWB multiuser system with non-orthogonal
codes.
Paper is organized as follows, In Section II, we have
discuss the general scenario for downlink communication
with multimedia transmission under multiuser environment.
In section III the system model for DS-UWB is discussed. In
section IV we have described the system model for TH-PAM
UWB. Section V discusses different UWB channel model.
In section VI we showed simulation results with AWGN
and UWB channel for synchronous and asynchronous trans-
mission. Also effect of selection of code is discussed in
detail. Performance comparison with TH-PAM UWB has
been discussed in section VI. Finally in Section VII, we
conclude our work and discuss future scope in Section VIII.
This work is an extension of our previously published paper
[11].

II. MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSION SCENARIO FOR UWB
COMMUNICATION
Figure 1 shows multimedia transmission scenario with
UWB for multiuser environment. where different users (or
Multimedia devices) data is transmitted by UWB device.
Here, we have considered that this UWB device transmits
data by, DS-UWB [1] or by other TH access technique [2],
[9], [10]. We considered that this UWB device transmits data
under two cases as synchronous and asynchronous transmis-
sion. This UWB device adds all users signal and transmits
information together over downlink channel. Hence UWB
device itself adds multiuser interference (MUI) in system.
To make uniformity throughout discussion we have con-
sidered all multimedia devices data as different users data
and performance is discussed by considering multiuser en-
vironment for multimedia transmission.

III. DS-UWB SYSTEM
A. System Model DS-UWB
For Ultra wideband transmission, DS-UWB multiple ac-
cess scheme is proposed in [1]. In DS-UWB one bit duration
(Tb) is divided into number of frames (Nf) each with equal
duration (Tf) such that Tb=Nf Tf. During each frame
UWB pulse is transmitted which is Gaussian monocycle or
Scholtz Monocycle. This pulse is a subnano second pulse.
In Multiuser environment DS-UWB signal is represented as
s(k)(t) =

of frames per bit, w(.) is UWB pulse. Before transmission
UWB device combines the entire users signal.

AWGN which is given as
r(t) =

After this particular user data is demodulated by code c(k)(.).
IV. TH-PAM UWB SYSTEM
A. System Model for TH-PAM UWB system
In literature [2] TH-PAM UWB system is considered for
Ultra wideband communication. In TH-PAM UWB single
bit duration (Tb) is divided into Nf number of frames each
with equal duration Tf, so Tb = NfTf. Further each frame
is divided into Nc chips with chip duration of Tc such that
NcTc ≤ Tf. During each frame UWB pulse is transmitted
which is either Gaussian monocycle or Scholtz Monocycle.
UWB pulse occupy one chip slot depending on time hopping
code cj which can take value such that 0 ≤ cj ≤ Nc − 1.
During each bit duration Nf UWB pulses are transmitted
by TH-PAM transmitter. For modulation antipodal pulses
are used. TH-PAM UWB signal is represented as
s(k)(t) =
∞
X
i=−∞
Nf−1

Where S(k)(.) is kth user signal, d(k)
(i) is kth user bipolar
data, Nf is number of frames per bit and w(.) is UWB
pulse.
B. Receiver Conﬁguration for TH-PAM UWB system
Received signal is contaminated by multipath fading and
AWGN which is given as
r(t) =

transmitted data bit.
In DS-UWB and TH-PAM UWB, we have considered
AWGN channel so for equiprobable binary symbols corre-
lation receiver gives optimum results.
V. UWB CHANNEL MODEL
In wireless channel multipath fading [12] will take place
due to scattering, reﬂection and refraction. This fading can
be slow fading or fast fading, which will change parameter
of received signal envelope and phase. This fading problem
is more critical in indoor channel due to presence of many
scatterers. So perfect channel modelling is required for
improving performance of receiver.
By considering the assumption of static scatter the Chan-
nel impulse response(CIR) for time-invariant channel is
given as,
h(t) =
N
X
n=0
αnδ(t − τn)
(1)
Here N is number of multipath components, αn is attenu-
ation for nth path and τn is delay for nth path. In UWB the
channel model is based on Saleh-Valenzuela model [13].
A. UWB channel model recommendation by IEEE 802.15.3a
working group
IEEE 802.15.3a working group has suggested channel
model for indoor UWB communication. This model should
be used for evaluating the performance of different physical
layer proposal. This proposed model is based of input
given by [13]–[21]. UWB channel model is cluster based
model. In this model(SV model) the same pulses multipath
components are grouped in to cluster. This cluster arrival is
modelled as a Possion process with arrival rate of λ as,
P(Tn|Tn−1) = λe−λ(Tn−Tn−1)
(2)
Here, Tn is time of arrival for nth cluster and Tn−1 is time
arrival of (n − 1)th cluster. In each cluster the multipath
components of same pulse is also model as a Possion process
with arrival rate of ∆ as,
P(τni|τ(n−1)i) = ∆e−∆(τni−τ(n−1)i)
(3)
Here,τni is time of arrival of the nth pulse in the ith cluster
and τ(n−1)i is time of arrival of the (n−1)th pulse in the ith
cluster. The gain of the nth pulse in ith cluster is complex
random variable as
Ani̸ Θni

p(Ani) =

A00 is the energy of the ﬁrst path of the ﬁrst cluster, Γ
and γ power decay proﬁle for cluster and components within
cluster respectively. IEEE working group has suggested
some variation in this SV model to make it more realistic
channel model for UWB as, multipath gain amplitudes
are considers as log-normal distributed. The UWB channel
model is described as,
h(t) = X
N
X
n=1
K(n)
X
k=1
αnkδ(t − Tn − τnk)
(8)
X is log-normal distributed which represent the gain of
channel.N is number of clusters, K(n) is the number of
multipath components of same UWB pulse within the N th
cluster. αnk is magnitude of component in N th cluster.
τnk is delay of component in N th cluster. The channel
coefﬁcient αnk = ±(1)nkβnk , whereβnk is the log-normal
distributed channel coefﬁcient of multi-path components k
for cluster n. βnk is deﬁned as βnk = 10
xnk
20
Where xnk
is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable with µnk
mean and σ2
nk variance. The random variable xnk is further
decomposed as,
xnk = µnk + ξn + ζnk
(9)
Where ξn andζnk are two Gaussian random variables which
represent the variation of the channel coefﬁcient on each
cluster and in each path within cluster respectively.

Finally channel model of UWB channel is described by,
h(t) = X

communication between transmitter and receiver with max-
imum separation between them is 2 meter, Case C is
NLOS with 8 meter of maximum TR separation. Case D
is Extreme NLOS multipath channel with maximum TR
separation of 8 meter. Based on IEEE 802.15.3a channel
model recommendation, ﬁgure
2,
3,
4,
5 illustrate the
four typical power delay proﬁle (PDP) of UWB channel
model. From this PDP it is clear that in channel model case
A the ﬁrst received component has highest energy compared
to subsequent component. So in this case if we use partial
RAKE with lower ﬁngers then we can expect good result.
From ﬁgure 3 it can be seen that near to several strongest
peak smaller peaks are surrounded. This indicates that
channel response is combinations of the several overlapping
clusters. Also the strongest peak is not ﬁrst one but is can
occur at any position in sequence due to reﬂections from
scatterer. So here partial RAKE will not give expected result
but we have to select the strongest component in cluster
hence SRAKE is required to use. From channel model C
ﬁgure
4, it can be seen that here channel is more time
dispersive. Components are available up to around 70 nsec,
while in case A and B it is available up to around 40 nsec.
This indicate that here we have to use selective RAKE to
achieve desired result. From ﬁgure
5 it can be seen that
channel in this case is more time dispersive and components
are available till 150nsec. So here the effective data rate goes
down to achieve the ISI free communication. In this case
more ﬁngers required to consider for achieving good SNR
at receiver.

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
Here we have investigated performance of DS-UWB
system under synchronous and asynchronous transmission
with orthogonal and non-orthogonal code. We investigated
performance under AWGN channel. Bit error rate is used
as performance comparison criterion. Also performance of
DS-UWB is compared with TH-PAM UWB [2] with non-
orthogonal code. For DS-UWB simulation parameters are
shown in Table 1. For TH-PAM UWB simulation parameters
are shown in Table 2. In both the cases performance is
evaluated with Gaussian pulse shape and Scholtz monocycle
as a UWB pulse.

Figure 6 shows performance of DS-UWB with orthog-
onal code under synchronous transmission. Here it can
be seen that with compared to two user case almost 1
dB more power is required when number of users are
eight in system with Gaussian pulse as a UWB signal.
When Scholtz monocycle is considered as a UWB pulse
almost same behaviour is observed. When Gaussian pulse
shape is selected, under both the cases of two and eight
users performance is better compared to Scholtz monocycle.
This improvement factor is around 1 dB. Figure 7 shows
the performance of DS-UWB with orthogonal code under
asynchronous transmission. Here almost same performance
is achieved with two and eight users under selection of
Gaussian UWB pulse and Scholtz UWB pulse. From ﬁgure

6 and 7 we can see that almost same performance is achieved
in DS-UWB with orthogonal code under synchronous and
asynchronous transmission. If numbers of users are more
than eight then system performance degrade as code would
lose its orthogonality property as number of frames (Nf) are
eight in DS-UWB. Under asynchronous transmission if the
asynchronous transmission delay (τ) will more than frame
duration (Here 2nsec) then performance also degrade.
Figure 8 and 9 shows performance of DS-UWB with non-
orthogonal code under synchronous and asynchronous trans-
mission respectively. From ﬁgure 8 it can be seen that system
performance degrades by large amount under synchronous
transmission. From ﬁgure 8 it is clear that non-orthogonal
code should not be selected under synchronous transmission.
Also it can be seen that with Gaussian UWB pulse shape
improvement factor is almost 1 dB compared to Scholtz
monocycle as UWB pulse. In ﬁgure 9 performance under
asynchronous transmission is shown with non-orthogonal
code. Here almost 2dB improvement is achieved with two
users compared to eight users case with both, Gaussian and
Scholtz UWB signal. From ﬁgure 7 and 9 it can be seen
that DS-UWB system performs better with orthogonal code
under asynchronous transmission.
Also we have compared performance of DS-UWB with
TH-PAM UWB [2] with non-orthogonal code. Here Gaus-
sian pulse shape is considered as UWB pulse for comparison
in both the cases. Here we evaluated the performance for
non-orthogonal code. To accommodate large number of user
under orthogonal code we need to select more chips/frames
which actually puts limitation on effective data rate. In
TH-PAM UWB number of chips (Nc) are three and to
accommodate eight users with orthogonal code require eight

have considered here in simulation. In TH-PAM UWB,
selection of orthogonal code is possible if we select eight
chips (Nc) by reducing data rate in system (parameter in
Table 2). From ﬁgure 10 we can see that DS-UWB performs
better compared to TH-PAM UWB under synchronous and
asynchronous transmission. Under asynchronous transmis-
sion this improvement factor is of 1dB with eight users. For
less interfering signals this improvement factor will be more.

12 and 13 shows the performance of DS-UWB with UWB
channel model A and B. Figure 12 shows the performance of
UWB system with two and eight users under asynchronous
transmission with non orthogonal code as a signature wave-
form. Except the synchronous transmission all parameters
for simulation is same in Figure 13 as 12. From Figure
13 it is seen that under synchronous transmission for better
performance orthogonal codes are required.

VII. CONCLUSION
Here we have investigated performance of multiuser DS-
UWB system with orthogonal and non-orthogonal code
under synchronous and asynchronous transmission. BER is
evaluated for each case with AWGN channel. Here it is
seen that DS-UWB system performs equally with orthogonal
code under synchronous and asynchronous transmission.
When asynchronous transmission is considered in DS-UWB
with non-orthogonal code, almost 2dB improvement is
achieved with two users compared to eight users case. Sys-
tem performance degrade drastically when non-orthogonal

codes are used under synchronous transmission. Under same
situation system performs little better with asynchronous
transmission. Also DS-UWB system perform better com-
pared to TH-PAM UWB in multiuser environment. Non-
orthogonal code with higher spreading factor can be selected
in multiuser DS-UWB system when all users transmit data
under asynchronous transmission. In multiuser environment
asynchronous transmission is the more general case so in
multiuser DS-UWB system non-orthogonal code can be
chosen for increasing the capacity. Gaussian pulse shape
gives better performance compared to Scholtz mono cycle as
UWB pulse. For synchronous transmission orthogonal code

VIII. FUTURE WORK
In this paper the system performance is evaluated with
correlation based receiver. We will extend our work and
ensure the performance of DS-UWB and other types of
UWB system under multiuser environment with adaptive
multiuser detection techniques [22].
