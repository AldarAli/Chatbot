Abstract—We present a data mining approach to recognize air 
written English Capital Alphabets (ECAs) using depth in-
formation. The hand motion while writing the alphabet in the 
air was captured as depth images by a depth camera. The depth 
images were then processed as the hand movement time series 
data, which was matched with standard templates of air writing 
by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. We collected a 
dataset of five variations and from them standardized 20 
templates for each ECA. The accuracy for ECA is 93-99% with 
an average of 96.3%.

 INTRODUCTION 
Human gesture is an important input modality for 
communication with computers. In hand-based gesture 
recognition technology, a camera (typical stereo camera) 
reads the hand movement data, performs the hand tracking 
and then recognizes a meaningful gesture to control any 
device or application. For example, a person clapping his 
hands together in front of a camera can produce the sound of 
cymbals being crashed together when the gesture is fed 
through a computer. In hand gesture recognition research, air 
writing is a prominent and difficult topic. Air writing [2] 
means gesture based writing in the air through movement of 
hand fingers by which a computer system can recognize 
characters and other symbols in natural handwriting. 
Previously, air writing has been studied by using wearable 
hand gloves [2], an accelerometer and gyroscope augmented 
mobile phone [4] and a 3D gesture input device [3]. In our 
approach, we do not ask for any special wearable device, so 
that the user can write naturally without any obstruction, 
shown in Figure 1. Algorithmically, previous approaches 
studied air writing by converting them into strokes. While 
writing in the air, users pause unintentionally or bend 
abnormally and, thus, they create extra strokes into the air 
written characters. However, recent data mining algorithms 
enable us to study a gesture signal such as air written character 
as a time series, as shown in Figure 2, information which can 
be matched with standard time series character templates. In 
this paper, we have studied the ECAs as time series 
information that can be recognized by matching with 
templates by using a time series data mining algorithm, DTW 
[1][6].

accelerometer signals into strokes. The concept of detecting 
strokes in air writing was first introduced in this paper. Amma 
et al. [2] showed how a wearable device can recognize hand 
gesture for air writing. A wearable hand motion tracking 
system captures movement signals using accelerometer and 
gyroscope. However converting the acceleration signal into 
distance covered for recognized strokes can be erroneous. 
Moreover, wearing a special device makes the air writing 
system cumbersome. Kim et al. [3] showed a way to recognize 
different people’s handwriting on continuous images based on 
similarity of the different shapes of characters or digits. We 
studied their research and got inspired to use shape 
information. Lin et al. [5] showed a way to use Scale 
Invariance Feature Transform (SIFT) on binary images. In this 
approach, the motion information is not considered in SIFT 
descriptors.  
We studied the process of generating strokes on ECAs 
extensively. We found that extra strokes are generated 
because users put some unnecessary pauses or bend their 
hands abnormally while writing alphabets. Those extra 
strokes cannot be merged together to form a regular stroke 
which demands complex algorithms like HMM [2] or 
Bayesian networks [3]. So, instead of processing strokes, we 
prefer to use whole ECAs written in the air as time series 
signals. Another motivation of using time series signals was 
to get the hand movement sequence of writing which are 
important clues to recognize air written ECAs.  
III. 
PROPOSED SYSTEM 
Our system captures the air writing of a user using 
Microsoft Kinect depth camera. Each writing of an ECA 
generates a set of depth images. We segment the hand finger 
movement using depth values. The hand motion is tracked 
from image to image, which generates a series of points (x, y). 
These set of points are actually the time series information of 
the particular ECA. As the hand movement is noisy, the time 
series data is smoothed using moving average filter [7]. We 
did it for all 26 English capital alphabets. For example, we are 
showing the process of writing “A” in Figure 3.  
A.  Applying DTW 
DTW is time series matching algorithm for which we need 
to match an ECA time series with standard templates of ECAs. 
The matching generates a distance score; the smaller the score, 
the better the matching. So, time series of an unknown ECA 
will be recognized as the best matching ECA. The calculation 
of the minimum distance was done using equation 1.  
 
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑𝐸𝐶𝐴 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐷𝑇𝑊 (𝑈, 𝑇𝐸𝐶𝐴)                 (1) 
 
Where U is a time series of unknown ECA. We define the 
time series U as two dimensional signals x and y; where x is 
the hand movement along x-axis and y is the hand movement 
along y-axis. TECA is the template of a particular ECA.   
 
 
IV. 
RESULT ANALYSIS 
We have collected data from 5 different variances. Each 
user was asked to produce ECA gestures in the air five times. 
From those instances on, we considered as DTW template. So, 
for each ECA 5 templates were taken from 5 users and the rest 
of 20 were used to test. The dataset is available in [8]. To 
measure the performance. we calculated the accuracy and 
found maximum 100% true positive with average of 52.6% 
and minimum 93.75% true negative with average of 97.8% 
shown in Table I for our five variations. In our process, we are 
depending on true negative rate instance of true positive rate. 
We applied DTW of signal time series samples to all variation 
of alphabets and found best matching results for each dataset. 
Ideally, it gave 20 best matching and 500 are correctly rejected 
matching. Table I shows the total accuracy, which is 
calculated using (2).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
We proposed a DTW based time series matching approach 
to recognize air written English Capital Alphabets. Stroke 
detection was one of the main challenges in state-of-the-art air 
writing recognition algorithms, but we have converted the 
whole image into time series representation to detect in air 
gestures as ECAs. In the future, we want to collect more 
datasets for better results.
