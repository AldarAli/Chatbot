Abstract— Brains are the most complex systems in the known 
Universe and they are composed of simple neural units 
producing electrical impulses. The key contribution of this 
work is the use of geometric concepts for neural states, in 
terms of currents and voltages. In the introduced adaptive 
neuromorphic electrical circuit, we relate voltage with current 
using the conductance matrix or alternatively using the 
impedance  matrix. After a change of reference system and 
introducing a new distance measure, we transform the initially 
linear relationships into a geodetic over the phase space. Every 
change of variables can be reproduced by a similar change of 
voltages into currents and vice versa with the help of the 
conductance or impedance matrices, respectively. Our 
geometric approach to neurodynamics can be applied to 
integrate digital computer structure with neuromorphic 
computing principles, which produces an efficient new 
computational paradigm.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
This work proposes a mathematical formulation of 
intentional dynamics following Freeman’s half century-long 
dynamic systems approach [1-4]. We consider the electrical 
behavior of the brain at the microscopic level and derive 
principle leading to higher cognition at the mesoscopic and 
macroscopic levels. In the past decades, artificial neural 
networks have been successfully employed  To model 
various brain functions such neural net models consist of a 
large number of high precision components, which leads 
scaling problems manifested in slow and often unstable 
learning, inefficient adaptation properties, and the need of 
external learning and control action. In this work, we aim at 
fast and stable learning and autonomous adaptation using 
low precision components. To achieve this goal we employ 
dynamical components, which are part of a closed feedback 
the loop with the outside world. The corresponding ordinary 
differential equations ( ODEs ) represent a stiff nonlinear 
system, which are very inefficient to solve on digital 
computers. An example is the IBM Blue Gene project with 
4096 CPUs and 1000 Terabytes RAM [5]. To simulate the 
Mouse cortex with 8 x 106 neurons, 2 x 1010 synapses at 109 
Hz, this digital implementation requires 40 KW. The human 
brain has 1010 neurons and 1014 synapses; its clock 
frequency is 10 Hz and uses 20 W with its analog circuitry. 
Apparently, analog is more efficient then digital by many 
orders of magnitude.  
The use of analog electrical circuits for neuromorphic 
computing with memristors could solve the problem of 
neural computation in the future. It is conceivable that 
learning effects so eloquently displayed by memristors are 
in fact manifestations of memristive behavior in the neural 
tissue [6-7]. In this case memristors indeed could be the 
Holy Grail of building brain like computers by exploiting 
the same mechanisms in computer memories as the ones 
brains employ. This possibility has enormous long-term 
consequences, which is difficult even to imagine from our 
present limited vantage point. Recall that for Turing the 
physical device is not computable by a Turing machine, 
which is the theoretical version of the digital computer. If 
we use analog systems, we do not need algorithms to 
program the neurons. Rather, the computer algorithm is 
substituted by the network dynamics evolving in phase 
space. For example, we can program the CrossNet [8-9] 
electrical system, which has been used to compute the 
parameters describing the desired trajectories. Geometrical 
and 
physical 
descriptions 
of 
Freeman’s 
intentional 
neurodynamics 
are 
beyond 
algorithmic 
and 
digital 
computation. To clarify better the new computation 
paradigm, we observe that animals and humans have a very 
efficient mechanism to use their finite brains to comprehend 
and adapt to infinitely complex environment [1-3]. We show 
that this adaptive system conforms to a geometric 
interpretation. This gives us the possibility to implement the 
required parameters in ODE to achieve the desired 
intentional neurodynamics. In this work, we consider two 
aspects 
of 
intentionality, 
namely 
cognitive 
and 
physiological,, both are reflections of nonlinear brain 
dynamics. At the cognitive level, intentionality corresponds 
to the change of the reference system, while physiological 
intention is defined by neuro-dynamical processes. First we 
describe the brain connectivity structure as a material 
support or hardware that makes it possible to achieve the

required intentional transformation.  The neural units are 
modeled by electrical circuits with capacitors and adaptive 
resistors and their dynamics is described by Ordinary 
Differential Equations (ODE). The solutions of these ODEs 
give the trajectory of the neural states as they evolve in 
time. ODEs are widely used in neural models, however they 
have shortcomings due to the difficulty of specifying the 
parameters and because their solutions cannot be found 
precisely in most practically relevant situations. In the 
introduced adaptive neuromorphic electrical circuit, we 
relate voltage with current using the conductance matrix or 
alternatively using the impedance matrix. Next, we 
introduce the change of reference system and a new distance 
measure, through which we transform the initially straight 
line into a geodesic over the phase space in the new 
reference. We show that every change of variables and 
reference can be reproduced by a similar change of the 
impedances and currents or voltages space coordinates and 
vice versa with the help of the conductance or impedance 
matrices, respectively,  we can simulate by neural network  
(hardware) any change of reference or any change of 
variables (software). We conclude the work with discussion 
and outlining directions for future research. 
 
II. 
INTENSION AND ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT 
 
Because the brain is a complex electrical circuit with 
capacity and resistors, we think that it can express 
intentionality by suitable tune of the electrical parameters. 
The instrument to match intentionality with the dynamics 
neural mechanisms is the geometry  in the space of the 
neural currents or voltages . We know that geometry is 
represented by the form of the distance in the given space. 
For example,  in the Euclidean geometry the form is given 
by the straight line where the distance is the Euclidean 
distance ; on the sphere, the form of the distance is a circle 
and the distance is the non Euclidean distance on the sphere. 
The form of the geometry in the electro dynamics neural 
mechanism is the trajectory of a point in the space of the 
currents or voltages. The distance in the geometry of the 
neural system is given by the square root of the 
instantaneous electrical power W  as follows:

In equations (1) the first equation is the ordinary 
computation of the electrical power by currents and 
voltages. The second equation is the computation of the 
matrix of the conductance C for which from the current we 
compute the voltages. To obtain the matrix of conductance  
C , we expand the relation between voltages and currents in 
Taylor form and we stop at the first derivative. The other 
equations in (1) are obtained substituting the voltage current 
relation by the matrix C.  Z is the impedance matrix. Now 
the power gives  us the material aspect of the intentionality. 
The other part of the intentionality is the conceptual that is 
given by the wanted transformation

We know that when the reference system for variables y is 
Cartesian, the straight line is a geodesic and the distance 
between two points with infinitesimal distance is the 
classical quadratic form

geometry are called geodesic. The distance in Eq. 8 can be 
associated with a system of ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs), the solutions of which produce the geometry. The

Note that Eq. 9 and Eq. 11 have similar structures. Eq. 9 is 
the geometric expression of the conceptual intention, while 
Eq. 11 expresses the material intention given by electrical 
dynamics of the neural network. Our goal is to derive how 
the conceptual intention can be transformed into its material

The geometric method to transform the abstract or 
conceptual part of the intention into the material part is 
similar to the transformation of the software into the 
hardware in a digital computer.   
Now we illustrate the geodesic for a simple electrical circuit 
and its associated ODE. Given the trivial electrical circuit

Based on the conceptual transformation, we can compute 
the electrical parameters, impedances Z, by which the 
movement on the surface can be obtained by an electrical 
circuit whose parameters are in agreement with the

For more complex neural networks, we can derive the 
corresponding geodesics in a similar fashion. For example, 
we could consider have the electrical representation of a 
neural network as shown in Fig. 6. The axon circuitry is 
shown in Fig. 7. The geodesic can be derived for these 
networks as well, but we do not give the details in this brief 
paper.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this work, we employed geometric concepts for states of 
a neural network represented using an electrical circuitry. In 
the introduced neuromorphic electrical circuitries, we relate 
voltage with current using the conductance matrix or the 
impedance matrix. After a change of reference system and 
introducing a new distance measure, we transform the 
initially linear relationships into a geodesic over the phase 
space. With the introduced neural network, we can simulate 
the geodesic movement for any transformation of the 
reference system. For a given transformation of reference, 
we can build the associated geodesic, which allows 
implementing the transformation of reference in the neural 
network. The neural network as an analog computer gives 
the solution of the ODE of the geodesic in the wanted 
reference.  Our work is closely related to Freeman’s work 
[1] on intentional neurodynamics, according to which 
intentionality can be studied in its manifestations of goal-
directed behaviors. The goal-directed behavior is the  
reflection of the cognitive transformation, which is 
manifested through the neural mechanisms that construct the 
mesoscopic amplitude modulation (AM) space-time patterns 
of cortical activity. AM patterns related to intentionality 
emerge through the neural interactions in the limbic system 
and neocortical regions, including the sensory and motor 
cortices. Intentionality in brain dynamics can be modeled by 
nonlinear dynamic systems, focused on the construction of 
meaning rather than representations [1- 4].  
In this paper, we described the brain and its parts as 
complex electrical circuits. Intention has two different 
aspects, namely, the conceptual part and the material part. 
The conceptual part of intentionality is given by a nonlinear 
transformation of the brain states. We introduce a new 
reference system, in which the geodesic, the transformed 
image of a straight line satisfies the condition that the 
minimum distance between two points in the state space is 
realized along the geodesic. The other aspect of 
intentionality is its material part. We observe that any part 
of the brain can be modeled by an electrical circuit and that 
the transformations between the voltages and currents define 
the change of the reference. Therefore, we conclude that the

actual transformation in the brain states is the material part 
of the intention.  
In a working intentional system, the conceptual and 
material parameters of intentionality should be equal. When 
the two parts are equal, we have the brain dynamic in 
agreement with the required transformation in the 
conceptual space. This means that brains realize the required 
transformation in the material world. If a task is defined in 
the conceptual domain, then the task can be realized in the 
material neural network using suitable parametric structures.  
In terms of the traditional digital computer paradigm, the 
conceptual part of intention can be viewed as the software, 
while the material part of intention corresponds to the 
hardware [12]. The difference between the geometric theory 
of intentionality and the traditional digital computer 
paradigm is in the way the software and hardware is 
described. In digital computers, there are logic statements 
for the software and logic gates for the hardware. In the 
geometric approach to intentionality, the “hardware” and 
“software” of brains are inseparable. Namely, we have 
geometric changes of the references in the multidimensional 
space as “software” and corresponding transformations in 
neuromorphic computing as “hardware.” Further studies 
toward geometric approach to intentionality are in progress .
