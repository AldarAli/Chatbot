Abstract— One of the most important sources of investment 
decisions in the stock market is the textual data contained in 
securities reports by companies. Investors consider investment 
strategies based on the information. However, since these text 
data are updated and published every day, it takes a great deal 
of time and money to read through and obtain information from 
all of them. In this study, we devised a method for extracting 
causal expressions from multiple sentences in securities reports.  
We extracted candidate causal expressions using clue 
expressions, and trained SVM (Support Vector Machine) by 
combining the similarity with the previous sentence and 
common phrases with the features obtained from a single 
sentence and verified how effective the method is. The 
effectiveness of the newly added features of inter-sentence 
similarity and common usage was confirmed.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the most important sources of investment 
decisions in the stock market is the text data contained in 
news reports, newspaper articles, financial summaries, and 
securities reports released after the end of a company's fiscal 
year. These text data contain important information. The 
information has a significant impact on a company's 
performance, such as past and current business results and 
initiatives, future prospect, development of new products, 
anticipated impact from overseas and political events, and 
measures to deal with scandals that have been discovered. 
This information can be used by investors to formulate 
investment strategies. 
Since these text data are updated and published daily, it 
takes a great deal of time and money for investors to read 
through and obtain all the information. In the past, it was 
difficult to structure such text data, so investors could only 
obtain the content by reading it directly. 
In recent years, there has been a great deal of research in 
the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and 
natural language processing to efficiently extract the desired 
information from text. These include research on 
automatically obtaining expressions that influence business 
performance by focusing on single sentences that indicate 
business performance factors in securities reports and using 
keywords that provide clues to sentence structure and causal 
relationships in Japanese[1], and research on extracting 
causal relationship sentences from newspaper articles by 
focusing on sentence structures that contain causal 
relationships.[2] 
These studies mainly focus on extracting causal 
expressions consisting of single sentences, and when causal 
relationships are described in more than two sentences in 
securities reports, they are often excluded from the analysis, 
and there are few studies that extract causal expressions 
spanning two sentences. Therefore, this study devised a 
method for extracting causal expressions spanning two or 
more sentences from securities reports and verified the 
effectiveness of the inter-sentence similarity and common 
usage used in the features for SVM. 
In Section 2, we introduce the research and related 
methods relevant to this study. In Section 3, we explain the 
flow of the method devised in this study and the features used 
for machine learning. In Section 4, we show the experimental 
method using the research method, and in Section 5, we 
present the results. Section 6 discusses the results, and 
Section 7 concludes the study.

RELATED WORKS AND METHODS 
This section presents the related works and methods related 
to our research. 
 
A. Related works 
In the study by Sato et al. [1], a discriminant model of 
causal sentences for single sentences was constructed using 
text data contained in the securities reports of the companies 
that make up the TOPIX 1000 from 2008 to 2016. Here, for 
example, in the sentence “猛暑日が連続したため、飲料水
の売上が伸びた。” (Sales of drinking water increased due 
to a series of extremely hot days.), “ため” (due to) is used as 
a clue expression as it is an important clue to indicate 
causality and is used to obtain candidate causal sentences 
from the target text data. Also, referring to the study by Sakaji 
et al. [2], we extracted features from candidate causal 
sentences using four features: particle pairs, clue expressions 
in sentences, morphological unigrams, and morphological 
bigrams, and constructed a discriminant model using SVM. 
In the study by Sakaji et al. [2], based on the clue 
expressions obtained from the Nikkei Shimbun newspaper 
from 1990 to 2005, the expression patterns of causal

52
relationships and clue expressions were classified into five 
patterns, and a discriminant model was constructed using 
SVM while filtering the clue expressions (to remove the cases 
where the clue expressions have non-causal relationships).  
In the study by Sato et al. [1], the objective was to extract 
from securities reports, but only single-sentence causal 
relationship was targeted, and causal relationships spanning 
multiple sentences were excluded from the target data. In 
addition, the study by Sakaji et al.[2] included up to two 
sentences in the sentence structure pattern, but the target data 
was the Nikkei Shimbun, not Securities reports and the 
feature extraction was based on the features that can be 
extracted from a single sentence. The results of their 
experiment were a fit rate of 0.68, a recall rate of 0.59, and 
an F-value of 0.63. 
 
B. Morphological analysis 
Methods such as splitting a sentence into words, 
generating a vector based on these words ,and using it as 
input for machine learning is often used in NLP(Natural 
Language Processing). Japanese is not divided into words 
like English. So it needs to be divided to the word level, and 
this is done by a morphological analyzer. 
MeCab is an open source morphological analyzer 
developed through a joint research unit project between the 
Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University and the 
Communication Science Laboratories of Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone Corporation. For example, the morphological 
analysis of” 当社グループにとって過去最高の結果とな
った “(The results were the best for our group.) by MeCab is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
C. Engagement analysis 
Engagement analysis (syntactic analysis), which is the 
process of analyzing modification relationships at the word 
level and in clauses, is the process of analyzing the structure 
of a sentence. In this study, we used CaboCha, a Japanese 
clause analyzer. CaboCha is based on SVM. 
For example, Figure 2 below shows the result of using 
CaboCha to analyze the phrase “当社グループにとって過
去最高の結果となった” (The results were the best ever for 
our group.”) 
Using CaboCha, the sentences are listed by clause with a 
set of clause IDs that indicate the clauses to be engaged. This 
method is used to obtain the relationships between sentences 
and clauses, which are used as part of the input to SVM. 
To make the list, we used the tree structure obtained by 
analysing sentences with CaboCha.The tree structure is 
shown in Figure 3. From the chunk and its link in the tree 
structure, it is possible to obtain information on Japanese 
clauses and their destinations. 
An example of a list obtained by the above method is 
shown in Figure 4. The "c" represents a clause, and the "to" 
indicates the  ID of the destination. A value of -1 indicates that 
there is no target.

The list obtained by this method is used to extract syntactic 
features of sentences.

EXTRACTION OF CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS USING CLUE 
EXPRESSIONS 
In this paper, after extracting candidate causal sentences 
from securities reports issued by three companies (Nissan, 
Honda, and Toyota) using clue expressions, we propose a 
causal relationship extraction method that adds inter-sentence 
similarity as a feature and common usage as a new feature to 
the features used in existing research and uses them as input 
to SVM. In addition, we show the data used in this study. 
 
A. Overview of the Proposed Method 
The rough execution sequence of the proposed method in 
this study is shown in Figure 5 below. 
The first step is to extract the items “業績等の概要” 
(Summary of business performance), “対処すべき課題” 
(Issues to be addressed), and “事業等のリスク” (Business 
risks) from the securities reports issued by three companies 
(Nissan, Honda, and Toyota), which contain sentences related 
to business performance, and then to extract candidate causal 
sentences containing clue expressions and the sentences 
immediately preceding them. 
 In the related study shown in Section 2, the clue 
expressions for extracting single sentence causal relationship 
candidates were determined, so they cannot be used directly. 
The clue expressions used in this study are those that were 
determined to be possible clue expressions in the case of a 
causal relationship spanning two sentences from the securities 
reports of the three companies mentioned above. Next, the 
obtained candidate causal sentences and the sentences 
immediately before them are assigned positive labels if they 
are causal relationships spanning two sentences, and negative 
labels if they are not. Finally, we obtain particle pairs, 
included clue expressions, morphological unigrams, and 
morphological bigrams from the sentences containing the clue 
expressions, and when all the obtained features are arranged, 
we assign 1 to the features included in the sentence and 0 to 
the features not included. The inter-sentence similarity with 
the immediately preceding sentence and the features of 
common usage are also added to the features and input to 
SVM. 
By comparing the above method with the existing methods, 
we verify the effectiveness of the method for extracting causal 
relations across two sentences from the target securities report. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Flow of the proposed method 
 
B. The data used in this study 
The data used in this study are Nissan's securities reports 
for fiscal years 2000, 2004, 2005, 2007~2019, Honda's 
securities reports for fiscal years 2007~2019, and Toyota's 
securities reports for fiscal years 2003~2020. From these 
reports, the following items were included "業績等の概要
"(Summary of business performance), " 対 処 す べ き 課
題 ”(Issues to be addressed), and " 事 業 等 の リ ス ク
"(Business risks) including text that specifically discusses 
business results. The wording and structure of the securities 
reports of the same company do not change significantly from 
one year to the next. Therefore, the extraction of cause-and-
effect expressions describing factors and results using clues 
is easier than in news articles. 
 
C. Extraction of causal expression candidates 
It is necessary to appropriately extract causal candidate 
sentences 
securities 
reports. 
Considering 
that 
clue 
expressions appear especially at the beginning and end of 
sentences in the case of causal candidate sentences that span 
two sentences, we surveyed securities reports and selected 
many expressions that appear at the beginning and end of 
sentences, referring to the clue expressions in the study by 
Sakaji et al.[2] 
Figure 6 below shows the original clue expressions 
selected in this study.Based on these clue expressions, causal 
candidate sentences are extracted from the target part of the 
securities report.

54
Specifically, if a sentence contains a clue expression, the 
sentence and the immediately preceding sentence are 
extracted as causal candidates spanning two sentences. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Selected clue expressions 
 
D. Features used 
In this study, we used particle pairs as syntactic features, 
and cue expressions in sentences, morphological unigrams, 
morphological bigrams, inter-sentence similarity, and 
common usage as other features.To obtain particle pairs, we 
used CaboCha to group morphemes into clauses, and 
extracted particle pairs based on the clause id of the target 
sentence.For morphological unigrams and morphological 
bigrams, those with a frequency of 100 or more were used at 
the stage of arranging the overall features. 
The inter-sentence similarity is the value calculated for 
the similarity between two sentences. The calculation method 
was based on Yamamoto et al's study [3]. In the case of cause-
and-effect sentences that span two sentences, the content 
(result or cause) of the immediately preceding sentence tends 
to be supplementary to the content of the following sentence. 
Therefore, the similarity between the two sentences was 
calculated by focusing on the nouns, adjectives, and verbs 
that appeared in the previous sentence, without considering 
the sentence structure such as particle pairs. 
Common usage are phrases (nouns, adjectives, verbs) that 
are common to the previous sentence. The feature of the 
common usage to be input to the SVM is 1 if the causal 
candidate sentence has that usage as a common usage, and 0 
if it does not. 
For the extraction of nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the 
sentences, we used the part-of-speech information from the 
MeCab analysis results. 
Table 1 below shows an overview of the features.

and the particle in the phrase 
pertaining to the phrase to which the 
core phrase is applied (the base phrase) 
as the back particle.

Inter-sentence 
similarity 
The sentence immediately before 
the sentence containing the clue 
expression 
is 
𝑆𝑖
.the 
sentence 
containing the clue expression is 
𝑆𝑗 .There is a high possibility that 𝑆𝑖 
and 𝑆𝑗  have a common word in the 
cohesion by use. Therefore, the value 
expressed in the following equation is 
the inter-document similarity. 
 
𝑇(𝑆𝑖): Word sets of nouns, verbs, 
and adjectives in sentence 𝑆𝑖. 
Common 
usage 
As with inter-sentence similarity, it 
is a feature related to the usage (noun, 
adjective, verb) that is common to the 
previous sentence. 
Unlike inter-sentence similarity, it 
extracts the usage itself that is common 
to the previous sentence. 
 
 
E. Input to SVM 
For each candidate causal sentence extracted based on the 
clue expressions, the features can be obtained. 
𝑠𝑖𝑚 (𝑇(𝑆𝑖), 𝑇(𝑆𝑗))
= |𝑇(𝑆𝑖) ∩ 𝑇(𝑆𝑗)|
√|𝑇(𝑆𝑖)𝑇(𝑆𝑗)|

For the input to the SVM, the features were arranged 
without overlap, except for the inter-sentence similarity, and 
a vector was created with 1 if the feature obtained from each 
candidate causal sentence was included and 0 if it was not.

EXPERIMENTS 
The experimental procedure based on the proposed 
method is shown. 
A. Data Set 
The data used in this study are Nissan's annual securities 
reports for fiscal years 2000, 2004, 2005, 2007~2019, Honda's 
annual securities reports for fiscal years 2007~2019, and 
Toyota's securities reports for fiscal years 2003~2020. 
B. Settings 
The candidate causal sentences were extracted using the 
clue expressions shown in Figure 6. The extracted text was 
extracted line by line and saved in csv format as sentence1 for 
the sentence immediately before the clue expression if it was 
included, and sentence2 for the sentence including the cue 
expression. After that, we manually assigned labels to the 
saved csv files: 1 if there was a causal relationship between 
sentence1 and sentence2, and 0 if there was not. 
As a result of the extraction, we were able to extract 3879 
sentences from the target securities reports as candidate 
sentences for causal relationships spanning two sentences, of 
which 989 sentences were assigned positive labels and 2890 
sentences were assigned negative labels. The features shown 
in the proposed method 3.4 were used as the features of each 
sentence. 
We used train_testsplit to split the training data and test 
data, and test size was set to 0.3. To avoid data bias, we used 
the stratify parameter. In addition, cross validation was used 
to reduce overtraining. The kernel of the SVM model was 
linear, and the value of the regularization C was 10.

VI. 
DISCUSSIONS 
In this section, we discuss the experimental results and 
show the effectiveness and problems of newly devised 
features. 
 
A. Comparison with conventional methods 
As can be seen from Table 2 and 3, Accuracy increased 
by 1%, and Precision increased by 1.8%, Recall increased by 
2%, and F-score increased by 1.9% for the proposed method. 
In addition, as can be seen from Table 2 and Table 4, 
Accuracy increased by 0.6%, Precision increased by 0.7%, 
Recall increased by 1.8%, and the F-measure increased by 
1.3% for the proposed method when only the features of 
common words were added to the existing method. 
Furthermore, as can be seen from Table 2 and Table 5, 
Accuracy increased by 0.5%, Precision increased by 1.2%, 
Recall increased by 0.8%, and the F-measure increased by 
1% for the method that only added the feature of inter-
sentence similarity to the existing method. 
In the above comparisons, the proposed method for 
extracting causal relationships across multiple sentences has 
certain results, as it produces better results than the 
conventional method. However, as shown in Table 2 and 
Table 3, the proposed method is not always better than the 
conventional method in the third and fifth comparisons, 
respectively. The proposed method must be improved by 
increasing the amount of target data, dividing the training 
data, and appropriately adjusting each parameter of SVM. 
 
B. Inter-sentential similarity and its validity as a feature of 
common speech and its problems 
The comparison between the proposed method and the 
existing method with the addition of inter-sentence similarity 
and common usage as features is confirmed that all the 
evaluation indices increased even when each of them was 
added by itself. Therefore, we believe that these two features 
are effective as features for extracting causal relations across 
two sentences. 
The increase in the evaluation index value with the 
addition of these new features was between 0.5 and 1.0, 
which does not necessarily mean that the effectiveness of this 
study on other companies' securities reports data is 
guaranteed, since the learning and evaluation was conducted 
using a limited amount of securities report data. As a 
countermeasure to this problem, an increase in the number of 
securities reports can be considered. 
In addition, when we look at the average of the absolute 
value of the difference from the mean for each evaluation 
value of the proposed method, we can see that the Accuracy 
is 0.4, Precision is 0.9, Recall is 0.7, and the F-score is 0.6. 
This is thought to be due to the influence of the data used for 
training, but to have a stable two-sentence causal relationship 
extraction method, it is necessary to reduce this blur by using 
appropriate training data that reflects the characteristics of all 
data from among all data. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this study, we used clue expressions that can be used 
as clues for causal sentences spanning two sentences selected 
independently from the ”業績の概要”(Summary of Business 
Results), “対処すべき課題”(Issues to Be Addressed), and 
“業績等のリスク”(Business Risks) where text data can be 
obtained from the securities reports of Nissan, Honda, and 
Toyota, especially for the contents related to business results. 
We then created a model for extracting causal relations 
spanning two sentences using SVM with the features of 
particle pairs, included clue expressions, morphological 
unigrams, and morphological bigrams used in existing 
research, plus inter-sentence similarity and common usage. 
In future research, we aim to extract sentences containing 
causal relationships from a wide range of text data, not 
limited to securities reports. For this purpose, it is necessary 
to consider the extraction of candidate sentences other than 
clue expressions. In addition, we aim to extract the causal part 
and the resultant part from the extracted sentences.
As a result, we were able to obtain a better evaluation 
value compared to the existing methods, and we were able to 
prove the effectiveness of the inter-sentence similarity and 
common terms. 
Future work includes increasing the number of target data, 
re-examining the cue expressions used to extract causal 
candidate sentences spanning two sentences, adjusting the 
data partitioning method and each parameter of machine 
learning, and examining the extraction method when a causal 
sentence exists before the previous sentence.
