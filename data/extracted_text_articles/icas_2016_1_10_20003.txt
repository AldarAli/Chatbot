Abstract—In this research, we developed a modular robot by 
improving our previous rescue robot. The previous robot has 
many serially connected crawlers to realize high mobility. 
However, the number of the crawler units was fixed and the 
operator could not customize the robot for the given task. In 
this research, we modularized our previous robot to solve this 
problem. We conducted experiments and demonstrated that 
the proposed robot can be applied to various search tasks by 
changing its formation.

 INTRODUCTION  
Maintenance and inspection of buildings are among the 
important tasks for robots, and these robot can be diverted to 
search and rescue missions when disaster occurs [1]. The 
serially connected robot is a possible candidate for such 
robots [2-5]. It can overcome dents, bumps, steps, and rubble 
by utilizing its many crawlers. In addition, it can enter small 
spaces because its shape is long and thin. 
However, these types of conventional robots have 
problems in operation [1-3]. Usually, these robots have many 
actuators and complex autonomous control or manual 
operation 
is 
required to operate 
in 
real 
complex 
environments such as rubble. In our conventional works [4, 
5], to solve this problem, we proposed a serially connected 
crawler robot that has passive joints. Because the passive 
joints adapt to rubble without operation, the proposed robot 
can overcome rubble easily without complex control.  
Unfortunately, the number of links of this previous robot 
was fixed, as was the search function of the robot. Thus, the 
operator could not customize the robot for the given task and 
given environment. 
In this research, to solve this problem, we developed a 
modular robot by improving our previous serially connected 
crawler robot. Experiments were conducted and we 
demonstrated that the proposed robot can be applied to 
various search tasks by changing its formation. 
 
II. 
PROPOSED ROBOT 
We modularized each link of the previous robot. Figure 1 
shows the basic structure of a module.  
 
Figure 1.  Basic structure. 
As shown in figure 1. The basic module has a crawler on 
each of its two sides, and each crawler is rotated 
independently by its own DC motor. The basic module has 
load space, and we extend the function of the module by 
installing various devices as shown in Figure 2 and Table 1.

For example, by installing a battery, the basic module 
alone can be operated. It can turn to the desired direction by 
changing the rotating speed of the crawlers. These crawlers 
are operated by the user interface of a typical radio-
controlled car.

By connecting various modules, some abilities of the 
robot can be enhanced. Figure 3 shows an example of three-
module robot. Each module has a flexible link to connect 
another module. 
  
 
Figure 3.  Muti-modules robot. 
As shown in Figure 3. By connecting many modules, the 
mobility to overcome rubble can be enhanced. We can also 
install many functions on the robot. For example, by 
installing sensors and a PC, this robot can be controlled 
autonomously.  
In case of many connected modules, the robot can be 
controlled by the mechanism proposed in [4, 5] as shown in 
Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4.  Turning mechanism. 
We installed two wires on both sides of the robot as shown 
in Figure 3 and 4. These wires are pulled by an active pulley. 
Because all the joints are flexible, when the right (left) side 
of the wire is pulled, the body twists to the right (left), and 
the robot moves to the right (left). Because the joints move 
passively, the robot also adapts to complex environments and 
can avoid obstacles by utilizing the reactive force from 
contacting obstacles. Details of this mechanism are available 
in [4, 5].  
 
Figure 5 shows the previous robot and proposed four-
module robot.

As shown in Figure 5, a robot similar to the previous robot 
can be realized by connecting Battery module, Camera 
module, and Pully module.

EXPERIMENT 
We conducted experiments to confirm its mobility. Table

From Table 2, we confirmed that the small number of 
modules robots have higher turning abilities, and the large 
number of modules robots have higher mobility to overcome 
bump and dent. 
Next, we conducted experiments to confirm performance 
of the proposed module mechanism. First, we applied a one-
module robot to the task of inspection in a ceiling space as 
shown in Figure 6.

The module has two LED lights and one wireless 
omnidirectional camera. By exploiting its small size, the 
robot could enter the ceiling space. 
Secondly, we applied four-modules robot to stairs with 
rubbles in order to confirm its mobility. Figure 7 shows 
experimental result.  
 
Figure 7.  Experiment result of stairs 
We can confirm that the robot has high mobility. In 
addition, as the flexible joints moves passively to adopt 
environment, operator did not have to control each joint. It 
means that proposed robot can be operated very easily and 
has high mobility. 
Thirdly, we applied a four-modules autonomous robot to 
a rubble environment in order to confirm its autnomyy. This 
robot has a camera and a PC, and it chases a red target. 
Figure 8 shows the experimental result.

We confirmed that the robot can chase the red target 
autonoumously with overcoming the rubbles.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this research, we developed a modular robot by 
improving our previous serially connected crawler robot. 
With the proposed mechanism, the operator can customize 
the robot for a given task and given environment. Thus, the 
applicable tasks are drastically widened compared with the 
previous robot. 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robot, a 
prototype robot was developed. The results of experiments 
confirmed the advantages of both a small robot and a long-
shaped robot can be realized by changing its formation.
