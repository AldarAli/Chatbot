Abstract‚Äî This paper investigates the applicability of an 
intuitive wayfinding system in complex buildings using Visible 
Light Communication (VLC). Data from the sender is encoded, 
modulated and converted into light signals emitted by the 
transmitters. Tetra-chromatic white sources, located in ceiling 
landmarks, are used providing a different data channel for 
each chip. At the mobile receivers, the modulated light signals, 
containing the ID and the 3D geographical position of the 
transmitter and wayfinding information, is received by SiC 
photodetector 
with 
light 
filtering 
and 
demultiplexing 
properties. The effect of the location of the Access Points (APs) 
is evaluated and a model for the cellular networks is analyzed 
using orthogonal topologies. A 3D localization design, 
demonstrated by a prototype implementation, is presented. 
Uplink transmission is also implemented and the 3D best route 
to navigate calculated. The results showed that the system 
allows determining the position of a mobile target inside the 
network, to infer the travel direction along the time and to 
interact with information received optimizing the route 
towards the destination.

INTRODUCTION 
Optical wireless communication has been widely 
studied during the last years in short-range applications. 
Therefore, communications within personal working/living 
spaces are highly demanded. Multi-device connectivity can 
tell users, from any device, where they are, where they need 
to be and what they need to do when they get there. In the 
future accurate indoor positioning might not be viable by 
sole utilizing RF communications. Research has shown that 
compared to outdoors, people tend to lose orientation a lot 
easier within complex buildings [1] [2]. Fine-grained indoor 
localization can be useful enabling several applications [3] 
[4].  
To support people‚Äôs wayfinding activities in unfamiliar 
indoor environments, a method able to generate ceiling 
landmark route instructions using VLC is proposed. VLC is 
a data transmission technology [5] [6]. It can be easily used 
in indoor environments using the existing LED lighting 
infrastructure with few modifications [7] [8]. This means 
that the LEDs are twofold by providing illumination as well 
as communication. Research is still needed to design LED 
arrangements that can optimize communication performance 
while meeting the illumination constraints.  
Each luminaire for downlink transmission become a 
single cell in which the optical access point (AP) is located 
in the ceiling. Data from the sender (the map information 
and the path messages necessary to wayfinding) is encoded, 
modulated and converted into light signals emitted by the 
transmitters. Tetra-chromatic white sources are used 
providing a different data channel for each chip. The use of 
white polychromatic LEDs in the ceiling offers also, the 
possibility of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) 
which enhances the transmission data rate. To receive the 
mapped information generated from the ceiling light in 
visual light form, the users are equipped with a receiver 
module that displays this fabricated information in the 
mobile terminal. Receiver modules includes a photodetector 
based on a tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light controlled 
filter [9] [10] [11] that multiplexes the different optical 
channels, 
performs 
different 
filtering 
processes 
(amplification, switching, and wavelength conversion) and 
finally decodes the encoded signals, recovering the 
transmitted information. This kind of receiver has proved to 
be adequate when used in large indoor environments with a 
2D building model [12]. However, vertical positioning is 
also important [13] [14]. 3D tracking is difficult by the need

for additional coverage for passages between floors (e.g., 
stairs, elevators).  
In this paper, a dynamic LED-assisted positioning and 
navigation VLC system is proposed. A 3D model for the 
building is established. The transmitted information, indoor 
position, motion direction, as well as bi-directional 
communication are determined. The proposed LED aided 
system involves wireless communication, smart sensoring 
and optical sources network, building up a transdisciplinary 
approach framed in cyber-physical systems. 
The paper is organized as follows. After the 
introduction (Section I), in Section II, a VLC scenario for 
large environments is established and the dynamic 
navigation system explained. In Section III, the protocol 
communication is presented and the encoding techniques 
used analyzed. In Section IV, the wayfinding evaluation is 
discussed. Finally, in Section V, conclusions and future 
trends are addressed.  
II. 
DYNAMIC NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
When we are looking for the shortest route to a place, we 
want to be guided on a direct, shortest path to our 
destination. A destination can be targeted by user request to 
the Central Manager (CM).  
The dynamic navigation system is composed of several 
transmitters, which send the map information and path 
messages required to wayfinding. Mobile optical receivers, 
using joint transmission, extracts theirs location to perform 
positioning and, concomitantly, the transmitted data from 
each transmitter. To synchronize the signals from multiple 
LEDs, the transmitters use different ID¬¥s, such that the 
signal is constructively at the receiver. Bidirectional 
communication between the emitters and the receivers is 
available in strategic optical access point (Li-Fi zone).

Illustration of the 3D virtual floorplan. 
The indoor environment chosen is a shopping center 
with several floors. The 3D virtual floorplan with the 
information about the number of floors and the nodes 
localization is draft in Figure 1.  
The ground floor is level 0, and the user can go both 
below and above from there. Each unit cell can be referred 
as Ci,j,k were i, j, k are respectively the line, the row and the 
level of the top left node of each unit cell. To exemplify, 
Cell C2,1 is depicted in the figure for levels -1, 0, 1 and 2. 
Therefore, each node, X i,j,k carries its own color, X, 
(RGBV), as well as its horizontal (line and row) and vertical 
(level) ID position in the network (i,j,k). For data 
transmission commercially available polychromatic white 
LEDs were used.

each node, is modulated, the Red (R; 626 nm), the Green 
(G;530 nm), the Blue (B; 470 nm) and the Violet (V; 390 
nm)], the other have a dc driving current for white 
perception [15]. To receive the information from several 
transmitters, the receiver must be positioned where the 
circles from each transmitter overlaps, producing at the 
receiver, 
a 
multiplexed 
(MUX) 
signal 
that, 
after 
demultiplexing, acts twofold as a positioning system and a 
data transmitter. The overlap regions, the footprints, are also 
pointed out in Figure 1. Nine reference points, for each unit 
cell, are identified and give a fine grained resolution in the 
localization of the mobile device across each cell. The user 
positions is represented as ùëÉ (ùë•, ùë¶, z) by providing the 
horizontal positions (ùë•, ùë¶) and the correct floor number z. 
By integrating floor number information into the previous 
2D system [16], the overall performance of the system will 
not be significantly affected as this time the 2D positions are 
more important and the floor detection accuracy is high 
enough to handle automatic floor plan changes. Also, there 
needs to be stairs or an elevator to enable a connection 
between the floors. 
The VLC photosensitive sensor, in the receiver module, 
is a double pin/pin photodetector based on a tandem 
heterostructure, p-i'(a -SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n sandwiched 
between two transparent contacts [3]. The device is an 
active filter able to identify the wavelengths and intensities 
of the impinging optical signals. Its quick response enables 
the possibility of high speed communications [ 17 ]. Bi-
directional communication between VLC emitters and 
receivers is available at a VLC ready handheld device 
through a CM interconnected with a billboard receiver 
located in a Li-Fi zone.   
Different users are considered. Depending on the time 
available, they can find a friend, shop, have a meal or rest. 
When arriving, they notify the controller manager (CM) of 
their location (x,y,z), asking for help to find the best way for 
their needs. A code identifies each user. If a user wishes to 
find a friend both need previously to combine a common 
code for the schedule meeting. The first arriving initiates the 
alert notification to be triggered when the other is in his 
floor vicinity and generates a buddy list for the meeting. The 
buddy finder service uses the location information from the 
network‚Äôs VLC location from both users to determine their 
proximity and sends a response message with the location 
and path of the meeting point. 
III. 
COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL. 
An on-off keying modulation scheme was used to code 
the information. To create a communication protocol and 
overcome the technology constraints, a 64 bits data frame 
was designed. In Figure 3, it is displayed the representation 
of one original encoded message, in a time slot. Here, the 
transmitted node packet (R4,4,0 ; G4,3,0; B3,4,0 ;  V3,3,0 ) from cell 
C4,3,0 (ground floor Hall; Figure 2) are displayed.  
Several control fields are used depending on the type of 
transmitter. The synchronism (Sync) is the first and the next 
are used for the identification of the ceiling. A stop bit is 
always used at the end of each frame. For the luminaires, the 
cell ID (x,y,z) begin the second block while for the CM 
transmitter a pattern [000] precedes this identification. 
 
 
Figure 3 
.Data frame structure. Representation of one original encoded 
message, in a time slot: R4,4,0 ; G4,3,0; B3,4,0 and V3,3,0  are the transmitted node 
packet from the unit cell C4,3,0 in the network. 
Those sequences are followed by a new block (pin1) with 
the password of the user if a request is needed, if not this 
block is set at zero and the user only receives its own 
location. The last block is used to transmit the wayfinding 
message and may include, in the beginning, the code of the 
request meeting (pin2). 
 The same synchronization header [10101], in an ON-
OFF pattern, is imposed simultaneously to all emitters. Each 
color signal (RGBV) carries its own ID-BIT. Cell‚Äôs IDs are 
encoded using a binary representation for the decimal 
number. At the beginning of the binary code of the z 
coordinate an extra bit was added to represent the flor's sign: 
setting that bit to 0 is for a positive number, and setting it to 
1 for a negative number, the remaining 3 bits indicate the 
absolute value of the z coordinate. The last bits, in the 
frame, are reserved for the message send by the Xi,j,k node 
(payload data). When bidirectional communication is 
required, the user has to register by choosing a user name 
with 4 decimal numbers, each one associated to a colour 
channel. Here, each channel (RGBV) needs a binary 4-digid 
code. The decimal numbers assigned to each ID block are 
pointed out in the Figure 3. Results show that R4,4,0, G4,3,0 , 
B3,4,0 and V3,3,0 are the transmitted node packets, in a time 
slot, from an AP (C4,3,0) located in level 0. In this location, 
an identified user 9119 [1001, 0001, 0001, 1001] receives 
his response message [wayfinding needs] from the 
infrastructure.

In Figure 4, a MUX signal received by the user located 
in footprint #6 bellow AP C4,3,1, 
 and the decoded 
information (in the top of the figure) are shown. The data 
acquisition was obtained with the presence of environment 
light. For demonstration of the decoding technique, the 
signal received; in the same frame of time due to the joint 
transmission of four calibrated R, G, B and V optical signals 
is superimposed. The bit sequence for the calibrated cell 
was chosen to allow all the on/off sixteen possible 
combinations of the four RGBV input channels (24). Results 
show that the code signal presents as much separated levels 
as the on/off possible combinations of the input channels, 
allowing decoding the transmitted information. All the 
ordered levels (d0-d15) are pointed out at the correspondent 
levels, and are displayed as horizontal dotted lines. In the 
right hand side the match between MUX levels and the 
RGBV 4 bits binary code assigned to each level is shown. 
Here, 0 means that the channel is off and 1 that it is on. 
Comparing the calibrated levels (d0-d15) with the different 
assigned 
4-digit 
binary 
code, 
the 
decoding 
is 
straightforward.

signal of the calibrated cell in the same frame of time is superimposed 
After decoding the MUX signals, and taking into 
account, the frame structure (Figure 3), the position of the 
receiver and its ID in the network is revealed [15]. The 
footprint position comes directly from the synchronism 
block, where all the received channels are, simultaneously, 
on or off. In the received MUX signal, the maximum 
amplitude detected corresponds to the binary word [0111], 
meaning that it has only received the overlap transmission 
from the green (G), blue (B) and the violet (V) channels 
(footprint #6). The next block of ten bits gives de ID of the 
received nodes. In footprint #6, the network location of the

identifies the user code [1001, 1001, 1001, 1001] and finally 
the last block is reserved for the transmission of the 
wayfinding message (Payload data). The stop bit (0) is used 
always at the end of each frame. 
IV. 
WAYFINDING EVALUATION 
The evaluation of the system is performed and the 
experimental results  discussed bellow  
 
A. 
Fine grained positioning and travel direction 
To compute the point-to-point along a path, we need the 
data along the path. As a proof of concept, in the lab, a 
navigation data bit transition was tested by moving the 
receiver along a known pattern path. In Figure 5, the MUX 
signal acquired by a user, as well as the decoded 
information, is displayed in different instants. The 
visualized cells, paths and the reference points (footprints) 
are also shown. The user enters the floor 1 (see Figures 1 
and 2) by line #7 (C4,1,1), it goes to position #1(t0) and it can 
chooses the supermarket at C5,2,1 or the kinder garden at 
C3,2,1 zones, being directed by the CM into one of the two 
indicated directions (C4,2,1 # 5, C4,2,1; # 9) where he arrives at 
t3 passing through footprints #3 (t1) and #1(t2) from the next 
cell.

Results show that the location and path of a mobile 
receiver was obtained based on the dynamic LED-based 
navigation system. As the receiver moves between 
generated point regions, the received information pattern 
changes. Between two consecutive data sets, there is always 
a navigation data bit transition (channels are missing or 
added). For instance, when the receiver moves in the reverse 
direction, from C4,1,1 #3 to C4,1,1 # 1 two different ID 
channels are added (G3,1,1 and V4,1,1). Here, the 4-bynary bit 
code has changed from [1010] to [1111]. In the forward 
direction (C4,2,1),  the added channels have the same colour 
but different ID (G3,3,1 and V4,3,1). So, just by tracking the 
path in successive instant the direction of the receiver is 
known. Going forward corresponds to crossing lines #3 and 
#7, turning left cross of line #5 and turning right to line #9. 
Main results show that fine grained localization is achieved 
by detecting the wavelengths of the received channels in 
each region. The location and path of a mobile receiver was 
obtained based on the dynamic LED-based navigation 
system. In an orthogonal layout, the square topology is the 
best. It allows crossroads and the client can walk easily in 
the horizontal, vertical or both directions.

(t0, t1) request to the buddy wayfinding services, the right 
track (wayfinding data) for their previously scheduled 
meeting, pin2 [0011/3;]. At the right hand of the figure the 
scenario is illustrated. In the proposed scenario, user ‚Äú2015‚Äù 
initiates the alert notification (C4,1,1; t0) to be triggered in his 
floor vicinity (level 1) and initializes the buddy list that 
includes all the users who have the same meeting code 
(pin2:[0011]; 3). User ‚Äú7261‚Äù arrives later (C2,3,-1; t1), 
identifies himself and uses the same code in the buddy 
wayfinding services to track the best way to the scheduled 
meeting. For route coordination the CM sends a 
personalized ‚Äúresponse‚Äù message at the requested position 
(C2,3-1). In this message the buddy finder service uses the 
location information from both to determine their proximity 
and sends a response message to user ‚Äú7261‚Äù with the best 
route to the meeting.

CONCLUSIONS  
This paper proposes a generating method of ceiling 
landmark route instructions using VLC. Each luminaire for 
downlink transmission becomes a single cell in which the 
optical access point is located in the ceiling. Data from the 
sender is encoded, modulated and converted into light 
signals emitted by the transmitters. The mobile users are 
scattered within the overlap discs of each cell. For lighting, 
data transmission and positioning, white LEDs were used. A 
SiC optical MUX/DEMUX mobile receiver decodes the 
data and, based on the synchronism and ID of the joint 
transmitters, it infers its path location, timing and user 
flows.  
A 3D building model for large indoor environments was 
presented, and a VLC scenario in a three level building was 
established. The communication protocol was presented. Bi-
directional communication between the infrastructure and 
the mobile receiver was analysed. Global results show that 
the location of a mobile receiver, concomitant with data 
transmission is achieved. The dynamic LED-aided VLC 
navigation system enables to determine the position of a 
mobile target inside the network, to infer the travel direction 
along the time and to interact with received information.  
The VLC system, when applied to large building, can 
help to find the shortest path to a place, guiding the users on 
a direct, shortest path to their destinations. Research is still 
necessary 
to

the 
coverage;

minimized through MIMO techniques. Also, the design 
concerning the LED arrangements has to be improved in 
future, to optimize the communication performance while 
meeting the illumination constraints. 
Minding the benefits of VLC, it is expected that this type 
of communication will have an important role in positioning 
applications. Moving towards real implementation, the 
performances of such systems still need to improve. As a 
future goal, we plan to finalize the embedded application, 
for experimenting in several network layouts. Effects as 
synchronization, shadowing and ambient light noise will be 
minimized by distributing lighting sources (MIMO 
techniques) to optimize the coverage.
