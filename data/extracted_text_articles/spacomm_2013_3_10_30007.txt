Abstract—A novel range-spread target detection algorithm in 
white Gaussian clutter for missile-borne radars is presented. For 
missile-borne radars, range migration of the target echoes 
during a coherent processing interval (CPI) is serious, which 
disperses the echo energy of the target and increases the 
difficulty of target detection. In this paper, range alignment for 
target echoes is accomplished in the frequency domain during 
the process of digital pulse compression. Then a range-spread 
detection algorithm based on the waveform entropy (WE) of the 
average combination of high range resolution profiles (HRRP) is 
addressed, which has the property of constant false-alarm rate 
(CFAR). Finally, the detection performance is assessed by 
Monte-Carlo simulation, and the results indicate that the 
detection performance of the proposed detector is superior to the 
traditional energy integrator and is robust for different HRRPs 
of the target. 
Keywords-high range resolution; range-spread; waveform 
entropy; target detection; CFAR. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
High range resolution (HRR) radars are widely used in 
precision guidance in recent years [1], for the echoes of HRR 
radars involve abundant target information and can be used for 
target recognition and accurate tracking [2]. For HRR radars, a 
relatively large target can be assumed to be the composition of 
multiple physical scatterers which distribute in different range 
cells in radar echo, so is called a range-spread target [3]. 
Consequently, traditional point-like target detection schemes 
for low range resolution (LRR) radars may fail for HRR radars 
[4]. Many achievements have been made in range-spread 
target detection during the past decades [5-9] (and references 
therein). Precisely, range-spread targets detection in white 
Gaussian noise of a known spectral density level is addressed 
in [5-6]. In [7], constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detectors 
based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for range-
spread targets are derived. Adaptive detection of distributed 
targets has been addressed in [8], with reference to Gaussian 
disturbance clutter. In [9], CFAR detection of distributed 
targets in non-Gaussian disturbance modelled as a compound-
Gaussian process is studied. Nevertheless, the detection 
algorithms above do not consider the relative motion between 
the radar and the target, so they are not applicable in the 
scenario of moving range-spread target detection. In addition, 
some of them consume so much computation that they are 
difficult to implement in engineering.   
In this paper, we propose a novel range-spread target 
detection algorithm for anti-ship terminal guidance HRR 
radars. Firstly, the range-spread target echo model of a 
missile-borne HRR chirp radar is established and the range 
alignment of HRRP is accomplished in the frequency domain. 
Secondly, the range-spread target detection method based on 
the waveform (WE) of the radar echo after coherent 
integration is addressed. Finally, the simulation indicates that 
the detection algorithm is superior to the traditional energy 
integrator detector and is robust for different HRRPs of the 
target. It should be pointed out that the proposed detector 
based on waveform entropy needs not to estimate the 
parameters of the clutter, which is a must for many traditional 
detection algorithms. Moreover, the computational complexity 
of the detector makes it suitable for missile-borne radar signal 
processing. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we build 
and analyze the echo model of a range-spread target for 
missile-borne HRR radar. In Section III , range alignment of 
the target echoes is accomplished in the frequency domain. 
We address the range-spread target detection algorithm in 
Section IV. And the performance of the proposed method is 
assessed in Section V. At last, in Section VI, some conclusions 
are given.

Assuming that the radar is working on tracking condition 
and moving towards the target at sea, and the radial velocity 
between the radar and the target remains constant during a 
coherent

(CPI).

Due to mismatching, envelops of the pulse compression 
results in (8) are not sinc functions any more. According to 
[10], the amplitude loss in (8) is negligible, while the time 
shift resulting from the time-frequency coupling of chirp 
signal is significant and will affect range measurement 
accuracy. From (8), the time shift of the target resulting from 
the time-frequency coupling of the chirp signal is:

Additionally, the radial velocity v between the radar and 
the target produces range migration during a CPI. From (8), 
the migration time between the adjacent pulses is expressed as:

Coherent integration is widely adopted to enhance the 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of radar echo [11], which improves 
the target detection performance of the radar system. But when 
there is high speed relative motion between the radar and the 
target, the range migration will affect the result of coherent 
integration. Fig. 1 shows the range migration effects on 
coherent integration results of a point-like target with range 
migration factor P=0, 2, 4 and 8, respectively.  It can be seen 
that the range migration disperses the echo energy of the target 
in coherent integration and so makes it more difficult to target 
detection. 
Assuming it is required that the range migration during the 
CPI should be no more than half of the range resolution cell 
[12], according to (11), the radial velocity between the radar 
and the target should satisfy the following equation:

RANGE ALIGNMENT 
For missile-borne radar, equation (12) usually can not be 
satisfied. Therefore it is necessary to correct the range 
migration between the HRRPs before coherent integration. 
Supposing the velocity of the missile 
m
v can be obtained by 
the missile-borne inertial navigation system (INS) [13], the 
velocity measurement error is
vm
. If we adopt 
m
v as an 
estimation of the radial velocity between the radar and the 
target, the estimation error is:

where
tv is the radial velocity of the target ship. For the time 
being, the radial velocity estimation error   generally 
satisfies (12) and so 
m
v  can be employed to correct the range 
migration between the HRRPs during a CPI.

By utilizing the time-frequency symmetry properties of the 
Fourier transform, range alignment can be accomplished in the 
frequency domain. Firstly, transform the pulse compression 
results in (8) to the frequency domain by the Fourier transform 
(FT) in the fast time dimension. Then multiply them by the 
corresponding the frequency domain phase terms related to the 
radial velocity estimation
m
v . Finally, transform the products 
to the time domain by the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) and 
the result of range alignment is obtained:

compared with the coherent integration result without range 
alignment, the echo energy of the target has been effectively 
gathered after range alignment.

In practical applications, to restraint the side lobe of the 
Doppler [14], a weighting function is generally adopted during 
coherent integration, which expands the Doppler of the target 
echo. Moreover, the target ship may corner sometimes, which 
expands the Doppler as well. Nevertheless, the maximum 
number of Doppler cells that the target echo spreads in

 The 
more homogeneous the distribution of

’s 
energy is, the larger 

( )
WE A n
 will be. 
Accordingly, if the energy of a waveform distributes 
uniformly along its parametric axis, the WE reaches the 
maximum. On the contrary, if the energy concentrates only on 
single sampling point of the waveform, the WE is the 
minimum.  
For the average combination of the radar echo
( )
A n , when 
the target is absent, the energy of the Gaussian clutter echo 
distributes uniformly, which results in a larger value of 

( )
WE A n
. Whereas, when the target is present, the energy of 
the target echo appears in a number of isolated range cells, the 
sparseness of 
( )
A n  corresponds to a low value of

Therefore, the WE of

sequences and target plus clutter sequences effectively. Fig. 5

that 
the

 under 
the

H hypothesis is also independent of 
2
 . Thus, the false 
alarm probability is independent of the external clutter 
environment, which implies that the proposed detector in (20) 
is a CFAR detector.  
The Neyman-Pearson criterion is employed to make the 
judgement. Although the closed-form expression for the false-
alarm probability (
fa
p ) is difficult to derive, the threshold for 
a special false-alarm probability can be obtained by the widely 
used Monte-Carlo method. While the detection statistic is 
smaller than the threshold, 
1
H hypothesis is selected.

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT 
In this section, we assess the performance of the waveform 
entropy detector given by (20) resorting to Monte-Carlo 
simulations. The simulation parameters of the radar are listed 
in table 1, which are assumed according to the principle in [1].

In the following we compare the performance of the 
proposed detector based on waveform entropy with the 
integrator detector [5]. Gaussian clutter is generated by 
computer, while the variance is adjusted to SCR. Taking the 
computational 
complexity 
into 
account, 
we 
assumed

each SCR.  
Fig. 7 shows the detection performance of the proposed 
detector based on waveform entropy and the integrator 
detector. Simulations for target 1 and target 2 are shown in Fig. 
7(a) and Fig. 7(b), respectively. It can be seen that the 
detection performance of the proposed detector is superior to 
the integrator detector.

The detection performance of the proposed detector for 
target 1 and target 2 with different Doppler distributions (
0
M ) 
is shown in Fig. 8. From Fig. 8, we can see that the detection 
performance of the proposed detection method is robust to the 
HRRP of the desired target, and yet is connected with the 
Doppler distribution of the target. Fig. 9 illustrates the 
relationship between the detection performance of the 
proposed detector and the Doppler distribution of the target 
echo. As can be seen, the detection performance of the 
proposed detector decreases while the Doppler of the target 
spreads. In this simulation, the detection performance of the 
proposed detector decreases 1 dB while 
0
M doubles. In spite 
of this, the detection performance of the proposed detector is 
superior to the integrator detector even when
M0

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
HRR radars are widely used in precision guidance in 
recent years, for the echoes of HRR radars involve abundant 
target information and can be used for target recognition and 
accurate tracking. This paper presents a novel range-spread 
target detection algorithm for missile-borne HRR radars. 
Firstly, the range-spread target echo model of missile-borne 
HRR chirp radar is established and the range alignment of 
HRRP is accomplished in the frequency domain. Then a 
CFAR range-spread detection algorithm based on the WE of 
the average combination of the HRRPs is addressed. The 
simulation indicates that the detection algorithm is superior to 
the traditional energy integrator and is robust for different

HRRPs of the target. The proposed detector based on WE 
needs not to estimate the parameters of the clutter, and the 
computational complexity of the detector makes it suitable 
for missile-borne radar signal processing. Future work will 
focus on the practical application of the proposed algorithm, 
and the target detection performance will be further tested 
by using the measured data.
