Abstract—As the future big data storage center for tenants, 
cloud computing has been a hot issue recently, it consists of 
many large datacenters which are usually geographically 
distributed and heterogeneous, secure data access from cloud 
computing platform is a big challenge for cloud tenants. In this 
paper, we present a secure data access mechanism based on 
identity-based encryption and biometric authentication for 
cloud tenants. We review briefly about identity-based 
encryption and biometric authentication firstly and then we 
proposed a data access mechanism for cloud tenants, the 
mechanism set double protection for confidential data of cloud 
tenants, encryption will make the tenants data secure against 
the peekers and biometric authentication will eliminate the 
maloperations over tenants data by root administrator in cloud 
service. We compared the proposed mechanism with other 
technology and schemes through comprehensive analysis and 
experiment data; the results show that the proposed data 
access mechanism is feasible and suitable for cloud tenants.

INTRODUCTION 
As the big data center for tenants, cloud computing [1] 
platforms have many particular types of datacenters, or most 
commonly, groups of datacenters. Cloud service providers 
not only offer applications including search, entertainment, 
email and other services that Internet can provide, but also 
they have expanded offerings to include compute-related 
capabilities such as virtual machines, storage, and complete 
operating system services for science computing and 
research. At the same time, cloud computing has been 
proven to be a hopeful application platform and paradigm to 
provide potential consumers with valuable information 
technology services over the Internet and these services 
should be efficient, secure and rapid. In order to meet the 
above services requirement, cloud computing resources 
should be rapidly deployed and easily scaled. In cloud 
computing all processes, applications and services supplied 
“on demand,” no need to regard user’s geographic location 
and computer devices. 
Currently, many public and private cloud services are 
available for tenants. Generally, private cloud computing 
platforms are for special intention and will not offer 
servicefor others, but public cloud computing platforms are 
available to every one with Internet access. According to the 
type of service provided, public cloud platform include 
Software as a Service (SaaS) clouds like IBM LotusLive™ 
[2], Platform as a Service (PaaS) includes Google 
AppEngine [3], Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) like the 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) [4] and famous Apache 
hadoop [5]. Hadoop includes some subprojects such as 
Mapreduce and hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and 
has developed many open-source software’s for reliable, 
scalable, distributed computing. Private clouds are owned 
and used by a single organization or department. They 
provide many of the same services as public clouds, and 
they give the owner organization greater flexibility and 
control. What is most important is that private clouds can 
provide lower latency than public clouds during rush time of 
Internet occupation. Considering the benefits of the two 
kinds of clouds, many organizations embrace both of them 
by integrating the two platforms into hybrid cloud 
computing models. These hybrid clouds are designed to 
meet some specific commercial, science and technology 
requirements, helping to optimize security and privacy for 
customers in minimum investment 
Cloud storage is an excellent solution for tenants’ big 
data, and it is a promising technology and the benefits of it 
are obvious, but, as a commercial platform, security is the 
most important. To develop proper security mechanisms for 
cloud implementations is a big challenge. Except for the 
usual 
challenges 
of 
developing 
secure 
information 
technology systems, cloud computing is under some special 
risk [6], because essential services are often performed by a 
third party that .is unknown to cloud computing platform or 
users. These “unknown” aspects of cloud outside 
environment make it harder to maintain data integrity and 
privacy. In fact, cloud computing always transfers much of 
the control over data and applied operations from the tenant 
organization to their cloud providers, in some extent, it is 
similar with that organizations entrust part of their 
information processing operations to outsourcing other 
companies or agent platforms. Even the basic tasks 
processing, such as applying data updating and configuring 
network protocols may become the responsibility of the 
cloud service providers, not the tenants. So, in this 
circumstance, tenants must establish trust relationships with 
cloud computing service providers and understand security 
risk in terms of how these service providers should

undertaketheir responsibility, deploy and manage security 
on their behalf. This kind of relationship between cloud 
service providers and tenants is critical because the tenants 
are obliged to be ultimately responsible for integrality and 
protection of their critical data and information, even if that 
tasks processing or programs have moved to the cloud 
computing platforms. In fact, it is the most difficult to 
determine the physical location where tenant data is stored 
inside the cloud computing environment. Security processes 
and issues that were once visible for tenants are now hidden 
behind fuzzy structure by cloud computing. This invisibility 
can arouse a number of security and compliance problems. 
On the other hand, the massive sharing of infrastructure 
with cloud computing creates an evident difference between 
cloud data security and other traditional platforms data 
security. Tenants who come from different organizations 
with different security anticipation and privilege often 
interact with the same set of cloud computing computation 
resources. On the other side, data-access security concern, 
cloud 
resource 
balancing, 
changing 
service-level 
agreements and other updating dynamic information 
technology environments will provide intentional-destroyer 
with more opportunities for misconfiguration. At the same 
time, data compromise and malicious conduct [7] by 
adversary, root users or administrator are the risk that the 
tenants must face. Data access calls for a high degree of 
standardized and strict operating rules, which can help 
improve data access security by eliminating the risk of 
supervisor operator error and intended maloperation. 
Therefore, the risks inherent with a massively shared 
infrastructure mean that cloud computing platforms and 
their secure data access have to pay more attention on 
identity and authentication. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows; in Section 
II, security concern on data access is described and in 
Section III, a secure data access for cloud tenants is 
proposed. In Section IV, we give a detail analysis and 
experiment results of the proposed mechanism. Conclusions 
are drawn in Section V. 
II. 
SECURITY CONCERN ON DATA ACCESS 
Generally, in terms of the service level agreements 
(SLAs) between tenants with Internet Service Providers 
(ISPs) or Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), we can 
categorize Internet or cloud services as below [8]: 
 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Under this kind of 
service model, ISPs allows tenants to use their 
database and some public services, at the same time, 
the tenants can rent computation, storage, networks, 
and other resources what they do not have to perform 
science research and commercial operations, such as 
Amazon and Hadoop. The tenant can directly deploy 
and run the guest OS and applications provided by 
ISPs. In general, the tenants have not the privilege to 
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure 
but have privilege tocontrol OS, storage, deployed 
applications, 
and 
networking 
components 
configuration. 
 
Platform as a Service (PaaS): This service model can 
provide the tenants to deploy and run their tasks and 
application program onto the platform infrastructure. 
For example, IBM also provides the tenants this kind 
of cloud service platform to build their programs based 
on some popular programming languages and software 
tools. The tenants can not manage or control the 
underlying cloud system when they perform their tasks 
on the platform.  
 
Software as a Service (SaaS): It is a common model 
that has been adopted by most of ISPs. In this mode, 
the tenants are passive and only can use what the 
providers provide. Such as websites browsing, email, 
and others, service providers undertake all of the 
responsibilities and develop attractive software and 
services for the tenants, the tenants make use of these 
services under some risk because the service providers 
maybe leak their information or critical data kept on 
the servers of the infrastructure The advantage of using 
this kind of service is that there is no upfront 
investment in servers or software licensing.  
Cloud tenants do not want others to access or fetch 
their confidential data stored in cloud storage [9], so secure 
data access control is even more critical for data integrity 
and privacy. On the other hand, in general, there are two 
critical roles in clouds computing service called privileged 
users and the third-party system, privileged users refer to 
root users or administrators who working for the cloud 
providers. Privileged-users perform physical monitoring, 
resource scheduling, background checking. Privileged-users 
must have the capabilities to coordinate authentication and 
authorization with the tenants and enterprise back-end or 
third-party systems. The third-party system is a partner of 
the cloud service providers, it cooperates with cloud 
provider to easily and quickly leverage cloud services for 
end users.  
It is evident that most famous organizations, 
enterprises and even general tenants cite data protection as 
their most important security consideration when using 
cloud computing service. Typical security concerns [10] 
include the way how data is stored, accessed and released. 
Tenant sensitive or regulated data needs to be properly 
segregated and kept on the cloud storage infrastructure, 
including important archived data. Finding a suitable way of 
encrypting and managing encryption keys of data in transit 
to the cloud  platforms or the service provider’s data center 
are critical to protect data privacy ,integrity and usability. 
The encryption of data and the ability to securely share 
those encryption keys between the cloud service provider 
and consumer is an important way that ensures security of 
data access. On the other hand, it is very expensive to 
transfer large volumes of data quickly over the Internet, so,

it is very critical to protect the data security when 
transferring the data from tenants to cloud storage platform. 
When sending data to the cloud service providers, it is 
critical that the data is encrypted and that only the cloud 
service providers and tenants have access to the encryption 
keys. But when the cloud service providers stealthily violate 
the agreement and to obtain some information about the 
transferring data using the encryption keys. So, some 
significant restrictions regarding with secure data access 
must be established for both sides to comply with.  
How to set the restrictions depends on the feature of 
the data and the importance of the data to tenants, such as 
commercial value, personal privacy et. Several member 
states[11] of the European Union (EU) have set rules to 
forbid the nonpublic personal information of its citizens to 
leave their state borders. So, in a full shared cloud 
computing environment, all parties of the cloud computing 
participators must agree on their responsibilities to secure 
data and perform these security policies on a regular basis. 
These parties must take the responsibilities to make a secure 
data access environment for each participator in the cloud 
computing. 
III. 
THE PROPOSED DATA ACCESS MECHANISM 
Firstly, we review the identity-based encryption and 
biometric authentication technology and then we show the 
proposed data access mechanism for cloud tenants. 
3.1. PRELIMINARY 
A. 
Identity-based Encryption 
Adi Shamir proposed the concept of identity-based 
cryptography [12] in 1984 firstly. Shamir’s original 
motivation for identity-based encryption was to simplify 
certificate management in e-mail systems. When Alice 
sends mail to Bob at bob@company.com she simply 
encrypts her message using the public key string 
“bob@company.com”. There is no need for Alice to obtain 
Bob’s public key certificate. When Bob receives the 
encrypted mail he contacts a third party, which we call the 
Private Key Generator (PKG). Bob authenticates himself to 
the PKG in the same way he would authenticate himself to a 
Center of Authentication (CA) and obtains his private key 
from the PKG. Bob can then read his e-mail. Note that 
unlike the existing secure e-mail infrastructure, Alice can 
send encrypted mail to Bob even if Bob has not yet setup his 
public key certificate. Also, note that key escrow is inherent 
in identity-based e-mail systems: the PKG knows Bob’s 
private key.  
The distinguishing characteristic of identity-based 
encryption is the ability to use any string as a public key. 
The functions that compose a generic IBE can be specified 
as follows.  
In 2001, Boneh and Franklin proposed a practical 
algorithm[13] firstly, based on IBE technique. To describe 
the Boneh and Franklin IBE algorithm, from here on, we 
use 
Zq
 to denote the group {0,
q 1}
 under addition 
modulo q . For a group G  of prime order we use

in the groupG . We use Z   to denote the set of positive 
integers We give first some definitions and then the basic 
IBE scheme.

Biometric Recognition 
Biometric recognition is a process of automatically 
recognizing the identity of a person based upon one or more 
intrinsic physiological or behavioral traits that the person 
possesses. Physiological characteristics are related to the 
shape of the body and the widely deployed ones include 
fingerprint, face, iris and hand geometry[14]. Behavioral are 
related to the behavior of a person and voice and gait are 
among the mostly researched. 
From the viewpoint of pattern recognition, biometric 
recognition is a typical classification problem, which 
generally includes two main modules: feature extraction and 
classification. Through feature extraction, discrimitive and 
compact digital representation of biometric sample is

generated. In classification, statistical techniques are 
generally applied to learn biometric pattern for each person 
during training, and make decision on identity during test by 
using the learned patterns. 
A biometric recognition system can operate in two 
modes: 
verification 
and 
identification. 
Verification 
(orauthentication) accepts or rejects the identity claim of a 
person (for example, Bob). Identification determines which 
of the registered persons a given biometric data comes from. 
The idea can be described as follows, when any person say, 
q, want to use authentication system, first, he must get a 
legal ID from system and pass the system check by 
sys_checker. Then, uses the ID to create his biometric 
template, all of the created templates are storied in system 
database such as sys_database. In verification phase, q’s 
template is sent to the system matcher to match with the 
extracted biometric feature from q. Otherwise, in 
identification phase, the q’s extracted biometric feature will 
have a match with all the storied templates in the system 
database. Algorithm 1 describes the process of biometric 
authentication.

                                               }

                                               } 
                     } 
return 
} 
____________________________________________ 
Biometric authentication is a statistical hypothesis 
testing problem involving in a tradeoff between two error 
types: false reject and false alarm. The performance 
measures of such system are the false reject rate (FRR) and 
the false alarm rate (FAR) which can be adjusted by an 
acceptance threshold. FRR is the proportion of genuine 
users that are incorrectly rejected. FAR is the proportion of 
impostors that are incorrectly accepted as genuine users.  
The performance of identification is measured 
asidentification rate which is significantly influenced by 
population size among other things. For face recognition, it 
is found that identification rate decreases linearly in the 
logarithm of the population size. 
Being 
easy-to-use 
and 
non-intrusive, 
biometric 
recognition technology is widely deployed to control access 
to restricted services, for example, banking and databases. 
In the initial phase, users are required to enroll in a system, 
namely, to give examples of their biometric data to the 
system so that it can build models for them and this should 
be done only once. This is similar to the sign up procedure 
to establish ID and password. In the verification phase, the 
identity claim is accepted or rejected; or in identification 
phase, the identity is determined. Each time when a user 
accesses to the service, verification or identification is 
performed.  
Design of a biometric system needs to take into 
consideration such factors as the available sensors, the 
performance of various biometric recognition technology, 
existing security infrastructure, and cost and user acceptance.  
With the recent advance in biometric recognition 
techniques and low-cost sensors, we can expect the 
increasing deployment of biometric recognition in many 
fields including cloud computing.  
3.2. THE PROPOSED DATA ACCESS MECHANISM 
We design a secure data access mechanism for cloud 
tenants based on Boneh-Franklin IBE algorithm and 
biometric authentication, the detailed mechanism is as 
follows.

respectively. The master key should be kept in a secret place 
and the parameters can be distributed to all nodes. 
2. key generation 
When tenants are registered in cloud computing 
providers, each tenant will obtain a unique identity to 
identify him or her. In our proposed mechanism, the 
obtained identity is same with the one used in IBE algorithm. 
For a given tenant identity 
ID{0,1}*
 ( ID is the cloud 
tenant’s public key. It could be a random string and so it is 
very convenient and easily realized). According to IBE 
algorithm, the private key of the tenant can be calculated as 
following:  
Compute

 ,where s is the master 
key.  
The phase generates private key corresponding to given 
registered ID of every tenant in cloud computing. 
Step2: Generate tenant’s biometric template 
Cloud computing is a pervasive service environment for 
tenants, different tenants have different security requirement. 
To these tenants who have special security concern on data 
can generate their biometric template and be stored in cloud 
database. Biometric authentication must be needed when 
someone wants to access the data. Modern mobile and video 
technology make the generation of tenant’s biometric 
template very convenient and easy, many tenants can finish 
the process on the cloud interface through iphone and other 
mobile devices. The process of generation tenant’s 
biometric template is described in part of Algorithm 2. 
Step3: Encrypt cloud data 
Input: cloud data (which is created by cloud tenants and 
stored in the database of cloud platform), a private key (the 
cloud service providers), and an ID (the cloud tenant who 
want to access the data); output: encrypted cloud data. The 
detailed operation is as following. 
Input: A cloud data message

Step4: Biometric authentication 
As an excellent storage scheme for tenants’ big data, cloud 
computing has been a hot issue for a lot of consumers, 
generally, tenants’ different data should be processed by 
different security modes. Biometric authentication has the 
advantage of exclusive for tenant in data access. When any 
registered cloud tenant say, p, want to access the data stored 
in cloud, first, he must pass the cloud system check such as 
cloud_sys_checker. Then, cloud tenants use registered 
identity ID to create their biometric template and all of the 
created templates are stored in cloud_sys_database. In cloud 
data access, cloud tenant p must pass the biometric 
authentication performed by biometric matcher in cloud 
computing. Part of algorithm 2 describes the process.

ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON  
In this section, we mainly focus on analysis of feasibility 
and security of our mechanism. At the same time, we will 
compare our mechanism with other relational technology 
including cryptography and Role Based Access Control 
(RBAC) scheme. 
1) Feasibility analysis and comparison 
(1) Cloud computing will provide its legal tenants with 
pervasive communication service anytime and anywhere. 
Recent development of wireless communication technology 
has gained a rapid progress, many wireless standards and 
modes emerged, including 3G, Wi-Fi, et. At the same time, 
wireless communication devices also have made a quick 
development; some advanced wireless communication 
devices, such as iphone and iPod, equipped with many high-
class functions that only possessed by lap-top class device 
before. All of these advances make access of Internet by 
wireless connection become more and more dominant. In 
many public places, more and more people rely on such 
mobile devices to browse web page, to download 
multimedia and to interact with Internet.  
When applied our data access mechanism in cloud 
computing, latest communication technology can support 
the running of the proposed data access mechanism well. 
Users can operate mobile devices on touch screen and push 
technology. On the other side, the advanced wireless 
communication devices can be used as camera, can deal 
with massive multimedia data packet and run a lot of 
complicated software and program. All of these are 
fundamental for the proposed data access mechanism and it 
is possible for the mechanism to be applied in practice. 
 (2) In the proposed data access mechanism, biometric 
authentication is an important secure measure for cloud data. 
On 
general 
impression, 
biometric 
authentication 
is 
complicated and costly for common applications, it is only 
available in some crucial situations, such as bank counter, 
airport security, etc., but it is not true now, rapid progress of 
electronics technology make it realistic to produce cost-
efficient and multifunctional mobile communication devices 
which can read and process tenant’s some feature 
information such as fingerprint, face and iris, etc. It is 
reported that only the users of iphone in the world will 
exceed 100 million till 2012 [15]. Now, in some public 
places of many countries, these kind of advanced 
multimedia mobile devices are available for tenants free to 
use. Therefore, all of these prosperous situations make it 
feasible and convenient to apply the proposed data access 
mechanism in cloud computing environment. 
2) Security analysis and comparison 
(1) As we know, except for key leaking, the security of key 
not only is related with key length, but also depends on 
encryption algorithm. Symmetric encryption algorithm DES 
with 64-bit key (DES-64) has been cracked for about 20 
years and RSA algorithm with 768-bit key (RSA-768) was 
cracked in 2009 by some scientists in Switzerland [16]. So, 
for the sake of making data access secure in cloud 
computing, we have to find suitable secure encryption 
algorithm and secure key length. Identity based encryption 
algorithms are based on Elliptical curve cryptography 
(ECC). Related research results [17] show that the 
traditional asymmetric RSA algorithm with 1024-bit key 
(RSA–1024) provides the currently accepted security level, 
in order to reach the same security level, ECC key length is 
160-bit (IBE-160) and symmetric key length is 80 bits. On a 
PC with Redhat Linux 9.0, P42.8G processor and 512M 
DDR,we tested the average encryption and decryption time 
for different encryption algorithm, these time cost does not 
include keys distribution and parameters setup, the 
comparison is listed in Table 1.

From the results in Table 1, we can conclude that the 
proposed data access mechanism is the safest for cloud 
tenants. Although symmetric encryption algorithm has some 
advantage in key bit and time cost, the fatal weakness is that 
encryption key and decryption key are same and kept by 
different parties, in addition, the RSA encryption and 
symmetric encryption had been cracked and the attempt for 
cracking more bits of them will continue. 
(2) Biometric authentication technology has been developed 
for decades and many of them have been applied in some 
security scenarios successfully. In detection of criminals, 
biometric authentication such as finger-print and face 
recognition have made many pernicious cases come out in 
the wash. As the rapid development of social economy and 
technology, biometric authentication can be applied in more 
and more situations. Of all the biometric authentication 
technology, 
the 
face 
recognition 
is 
a 
convictive 
representative. In 1993, the American government launched 
a project called FERET [18] to found a series of technology 
development efforts and evaluation cycles, the face

recognition community benefited a lot from this project and 
built a large datasets collected to test face recognition 
technology, the large datasets push the research of 
technology forward quickly. Figure 1 show that from the 
beginning of the Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) 
program to the Face Recognition Vendor Test 2006 (FRVT 
2006). The remarkable improvement of face recognition has 
five 
important 
milestones 
since 
2003. 
To 
each 
representative algorithm, they wereevaluated on the false 
reject rate (FRR) at a false accept rate (FAR) of 0.001 (1 in 
1000). The algorithm for 1993 was Turk and Pentland’s 
eigenface algorithm [18] and for 1997 is Sept97 FERET 
evaluation [19]. The 2002 evaluation result is from the 
FRVT 2002 and the 2006 and 2010 is from the FRVT 2006 
and FRVT 2010.  
Figure 1 Improvement of face recognition from 1993 to 2010 
From the evaluation results in Figure 1, we can 
conclude that as the representative of the biometric 
authentication technology, the face recognition attained an 
enormous improvement these year, especially, from 2002 to 
2010, the improvement was very evident. The factors on the 
improvement due to advancement in algorithm design, 
advanced multimedia devices and more deep understanding 
of image processing. So, the low false reject rates (FRR) at a 
false accept rate (FAR) of the biometric authentication will 
enhance the security of the proposed data access mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Cloud computing has been a hot issue recently, as the 
future big data storage center for tenants, cloud computing 
is an Internet-based pervasive information infrastructure to 
provide tenants with data storage and service on demand it 
consists of many large datacenters which are usually 
geographically distributed and heterogeneous, secure data 
access from cloud computing platform is a big challenge for 
cloud tenants., how to design a secure data access 
mechanism for cloud computing is a main concern for 
service providers and their tenants. 
In order to seek a secure data access method for cloud 
tenants, we presented a secure data access mechanism based 
on identity-based encryption and biometric authentication in 
this paper, the mechanism set double protection for 
confidential data of cloud tenants, encryption will make the 
tenants data secure against the peekers and biometric 
authentication will eliminate the maloperations over tenants 
data by root administrator in cloud service. We compared 
the proposed mechanism with other technology and schemes 
through comprehensive analysis and experiment data, the 
results show that the proposed data access mechanism is 
feasible and suitable for cloud tenants. In future work, We 
will make our proposed scheme more efficient and put it 
into practice.
