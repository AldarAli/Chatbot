Abstract—In this paper, a novel protocol to mitigate co-channel
interference issue acquiring higher diversity gain is introduced in
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) femto cell environment.
The scheme works under three time slots using Alamouti Space-
time block code (STBC) and MIMO gains to achieve full diversity
order of four. A network based on wireless access consists of
two femto users points, and destination terminals as femto base
stations each equipped with two antennas respectively. The per-
formance is analyzed using 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
(QAM) modulation scheme. The results are investigated over
independent and identical (i.i.d) fading channel. Subsequently,
the obtained results by simulation show that the proposed novel
transmission protocol provides interference mitigated and better
signal quality of uplink femto users in cooperative wireless
networks.

INTRODUCTION
People all over the globe are stepping ahead to the revolu-
tion of wireless broadband services in the form of 5G networks
[1]. As ﬁfth generation networks deal with the ultra high
frequency regions of the spectrum, hence they consequently
characterize by shorter wavelengths and the original signal
tends to dissipate even after traveling up to tens of meters
due to several penetration losses that leads to a situation of
retaining smaller cell size. Furthermore, many shadowed and
non-coverage regions could be found under the macrocells
coverage areas such as at the edge of the cell, thick walls,
indoor environment and basements, etc. It is a big challenge for
the network operators to ﬁnd an efﬁcient solution to deal with
this increasing data trafﬁc demand and satisfy their customers
by providing high quality services.
Femtocell deployment is a hot research stream for the
researchers striving to improve the quality of service within
a macrocell. These are low power tiny base stations installed
within an ofﬁce or a residential area to improve cellular
coverage within a building. Commercially, it is sold with
different brand names like Airave (Sprint), Microcells (AT&T)
and Network Extender (Verizon) in the market [2]. The
connectivity of smart phones, cellular phones and portable
devices is increased through femtocells for cellular networks
especially in those areas where coverage of large cells is weak
or intermittent. There are many potential advantages of femto-
cells for both users and network operators. It provides better
coverage and many additional services to the users and enables
them to add the enhanced experience and extra capabilities
to the existing broadband services. However, despite of all
these characteristics, the main drawbacks include the higher
interference issues and increased in the number of handovers
that results in faster battery discharge. Network operators can
generate more revenue by providing many additional services
and better coverage to users up to their contentment. Therefore,
the demand of femtocell has been increased since last decade
and many commercial mobile operators have shown their keen
interest to expand this technology through 3G to 4G and
LTE/5G.
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems are
widely considered to provide greater spectral efﬁciency and
enhanced capacity. The transmission rate is badly affected due
to the several limitations on the modulation scheme with a lim-
ited frequency band despite of offering guaranteed high Signal-
to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in short range communications. MIMO
systems have drawn researchers’ [3][4] attention because of
the fact that they can increase the data rate without even
expanded frequency band by the use of multiple antennas over
the whole transceiver design. The proposed protocol exploits
this advantage of MIMO by achieving twice the gain achieved
in conventional femtocells to mitigate the interference occurred
in the overlapping areas of adjacent cells.
As femtocells are in microcells, there is a greater probabil-
ity of incurring interference between two adjacent femtocells,
especially in the overlapping areas of consecutive cells. In-
terference severely degrades the quality of service affecting
the actual gain of the transmitted signal. Researchers have put
serious efforts on the board to mitigate this interference in last
couple of years using various schemes [5][6], but all these
techniques cover different aspects and have not considered
MIMO in three time slots for the minimal interference in
femtocells [7][8].
This work analyzes the effect of interference on overall
antenna gain in overlapping areas of two adjacent femtocells
in MIMO environment and proposes a protocol for mitigating
this interference in MIMO femto environment using three time
slots. Antenna gain is ﬁnally achieved four times given by
equations in the overall system model by the exploitation of
MIMO. Simulation results using MATLAB clearly argue that
the proposed protocol is an efﬁcient technique for mitigating
the interference in MIMO femto environment using three time
slots as compared to many others.
To the best of our knowledge, no one has yet investigated
MIMO femto cells scenario with Alamouti coding technique
and exploits the cooperative scenario to mitigate interference
issue in femto cell environment. The remainder of the pa-

per is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the model
of the system, transmission scheme and the channel of the
model considered. Sections 3 and 4 discusses in detail the
input-output and closed-form expressions of a system at the
respective base stations and then will derive the expression
for SNR for both users respectively. Section 5 depicts the
closed-form expressions for Nakagami-m fading channel using
error probability analysis of a system. Section 6 discusses
the simulation results obtained in terms of a comparison with
analytical and Matlab obtained curves. Finally, Section 7 draws
the conclusions of the prosposed scheme.

SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, a novel approach is used to mitigate co-
channel interference in MIMO scenario in order to exploit
much higher diversity gain. Multiple antennas are assumed
to be equipped at the user’s terminals. For our system in
consideration, we assume two (2) number of antennas equipped
at the transmitter and receiver end.
For simplicity, MIMO based Fe-COPE system is furnished
with two nodes at transmitter and receiver end. Both nodes are
equipped with two antennas to make 2x2 MIMO system and
exploit the gain after mitigating the interference from interferer
node using three time slots. The communication is done in such
a way that user nodes act as a relay in the third slot. The femto
user 1 (node 1) has antennas S1 and S2 whereas, femto user 2
(node 2) has antennas S3 and S4 respectively. Both nodes will
work as a relay and will follow Alamouti coding in the ﬁnal
slot of transmission to exploit MIMO and Alamouti gain. The
transmission protocol is explained in the Table I.
The transmission takes place in three separate slots between
source and end terminals. It is also assumed that the energy is
normalized and at the respective source terminals, the power
of the signal is normalized to unity with E = { |Si
2| }.
Assuming equal noise variance No for the additive white
Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The perfect channel condition is
assumed at destination ends. The mathematical expressions for
the input-output (I/O) equations, SNR relationship, & moment
generating function (MGF) expressions will be discussed in
the next section for different fading environments.
A. Cooperative Transmission and Channel Model
In this section, the equivalent expression for end-to-end
transmission of SNR for both users at femto base terminals
is derived. The I/O relationship is discussed. MRC is used
at receiver to accumulate and add-up the desired signals and
with utilizing SNR equations, MGF expressions for both users
are derived. The transmission can be clearly explained with
the help of the system model picture. The detail schematics
picture of channel distribution associated with each time slot
is shown in Figure 1.
The ﬁgure clearly depicts that in the ﬁrst time slot, both
the ﬁrst antennas of both nodes will transmit whereas, in the
second time slot, the respective second antennas of both mobile
stations (MS-1 and MS-2) will transmit. In the third slot, both
antennas of the mobile stations will transmit using Alamouti
scheme approach to the respective femto base stations (BS-1
and BS-2), respectively.

tionship and respective closed-form expression for both femto
stations are derived in this section, as follows.

Step 4: Final step
In order to enhance the detection process, i.e., receive the
signal after multiple trials resulting in higher performance gain,
the output can be feedbacked to step number 2, and then go
ahead with step number 3. This feedback process ensures the
better detection probability.

SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO EXPRESSION
The approach is followed by the algorithm steps and this
section will conclude the SNR expression for user one at
respective base station BS − 1.
Using the ﬁnal derived equations and summing up the
received signals after detection, following steps can be used
to derive SNR expression.

After getting the desired SNR expression, the next step is to

taking into account the error probability (average SER) over

Simulation results of MIMO based Fe-COPE system in terms of

environment
The results obtained for the Figure 3 are for the case
when Rayleigh fading is considered from source nodes to
destination in a Rician fading environment. It can be clearly
seen that due to the MIMO and Alamouti gains, the results
get better but for the high SNR values, the values reach
to the saturation point and does not change much. It is a
good solution for the low SNR values and depending on
the different channel conditions, different approach can be
adopted.
VII.
CONCLUSION
A compact investigation on the performance is performed
for MIMO-based femto cells over different fading channels.
A novel protocol has been designed in order to mitigate in-
terference issue in two users femto cell scenario by exploiting
Alamouti coding gain as well as MIMO gains for 16-QAM
modulation scheme. The closed form expressions are derived
for the MIMO based Fe-COPE system over Rayleigh as special
case, and Nakagami-m fading channels. The protocol involves
ﬁve steps algorithm in order to reach full diversity (order
of four) and then derive the I/O relationship to calculate
SNR expression. Using the expression of SNR, closed form
expression is calculated using MGF based approach for MIMO
based Fe-COPE system. Later, the simulation results show
the effectiveness of the protocol. The results are obtained
using Mathematica and Matlab softwares in order to verify the
results. The BER vs SNR curves are obtained for higher values
of Nakagami factor m, it has been seen that for higher values
there is a dramatic change in the results. The high SNR regime
shows the promising results for the protocol and provide the
maximum diversity order.
