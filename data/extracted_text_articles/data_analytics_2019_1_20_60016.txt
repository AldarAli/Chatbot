Abstract—This study in cultural informatics investigates the claim
made in 2018 by several news media that performances of Johann
Sebastian Bach’s Double Concerto in D Minor, his compositions
in general, and of classical music as a whole are becoming ever
faster. Data for a total number of 19,660 releases in ﬁve of
Bach’s compositional categories from between 1950 and 2019
are retrieved from online database Discogs, of which 2,999
are analyzed historically for speed increase. For the Double
Concerto, we do ﬁnd a slight speedup, but surprisingly enough,
West European recordings speed up much more than non-West
European recordings. And whereas the Brandenburg Concertos
and several cantatas do speed up signiﬁcantly, the Trio Sonatas
for Organ and Suites for Cello Solo actually tend to slow down.
We review the original claims in light of this new evidence,
and contextualize our ﬁndings by relating to studies on musical
development, the pace of life in urbanized communities, and begin
to construct a scientiﬁc hypothesis for explaining our ﬁndings.

INTRODUCTION
Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) is undoubtedly one
of most revered classical composers in our time. Spanning
nearly 1100 compositions ranging from huge oratoria such as
the Saint Matthew Passion, BWV 244 through Brandenburg
Concertos, BWV 1046 - 1051 to works as small as the Sonatas
and Partitas, BWV 1001 - 1006 written for a single violin
only, many regard these works as the best that classical music
has to offer. Today, all of Bach’s compositions have been
conventiently indexed by a BWV (Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis,
literally Bach works catalogue) numbering, categorizing the
late master’s work in different genres like cantatas, concertos,
or harpsichord works. But the details of everyday performance
are not undisputed; many classical compositions have separate
movements, which are often annotated with a ‘tempo’ or
‘style’ indication. Traditionally, in Italian (even for German
composers), annotations, such as presto (‘rapidly’), adagio
(‘slowly’), vivace (‘lively’) and allegro (‘cheerful’) leave
plenty of room for interpretation on behalf of the musician
(see Figure 1).
Late 2018, several news articles appeared claiming that the
compositions of Bach, and classical music in general, are being
performed ever faster. First published by the Rolling Stone, the
article featured a record label’s study showing “performances
of Bach are almost 30 percent faster than they were 50 years
ago” [1]. From there, the news spread like wildﬁre. An article
on iNews - Britains Most Trusted Digital News Brand claimed
that “performances of classical music [...] are now one third
quicker than they were 50 years ago” [2]. They also cite a
highly positioned music scholar when giving an explanation:
“It’s a basic change in taste from the rather weighty concert
style of previous years towards something that is more light,
airy and ﬂexible.” Or, as the international radio station Clas-
sic FM so aptly phrased it: “classical music performances
are taken at a greater lick” [3]. Even more conﬁdent was
broadcaster WQXR, stating that “Bach is undoubtedly getting
faster” and like Rolling Stone, they also provide an explanation
for the speedup: “Society speeds up? Music speeds up.” But
even research institutions like the Smithsonian Institution,
administered by the US Government, reported the news [4].
“Johann Sebastian Bach’s music may be timeless, but [...]
even the compositions of [Bach] are not immune to todays
breakneck speed of life.” and “Clock the last 40 years and
you‘ll ﬁnd the beat getting relentlessly faster.”
So Bach’s music, or classical music in general, is speeding
up because life is speeding up. Interesting ﬁnd, but the problem
is that it isn’t true. Or partially, at best. Or for some recordings
of some concertos released at some places only, to be precise.
The news published by Classic FM, WQXR and Smithsonian
all refer back to Rolling Stone, which appears to be the
source of the news, but the lack of (academic) references, the
apparently thin basis for the conclusions (three recordings of
Bach’s Double Violin Concerto in D Minor, BWV 1043) and
the seemingly reckless adoption of the news by other media
raises questions about the scientiﬁc validity of the claims. Is
Bach’s music really speeding up lately, or is this another prime
example of fake news?
Fake news is a denomination that has seen a rapid increase
since the 2016 United States presidential election, even though
it conceptually existed long before [5]. Historically, the term
has been used to describe disinformation serving different
goals than objective reporting, such as political gains or social
unrest. In the ages of digitization, fake news seems to ﬁnd
its way to people much easier, with visits to fake news sites
originating from social media at a much higher rate than visits
to real news sites [6]. It is estimated that in the months prior
to the 2016 U.S. elections, every American adult had been
exposed to at least one fake news story [7].
Even though fake news only reaches a small part of the
overall audience [6] [8], Facebook and other social media
started tagging and removing fake news in order to combat
the distribution of mis- and disinformation [9]. Despite these
efforts, scientists Gordon Pennycook and David Rand found
that tagging fake news stories creates an implied truth effect:

once a story is not tagged as fake news, it is more likely
to be deemed reliable [10]. An earlier study at McMaster
University found that a statement, whether true or false, is
more likely to be believed if it expresses information that
‘feels familiar’ [11]. But repetition also results in something
like an implied truth effect: in an experiment by Frederick
Bacon, people were given a number of statements and told
that half of these were false. Even with this explicit aforehand
instruction, people rated the repeated statements to be more
reliable [12]. In Danielle Polage’s experiment “Making up
History: False Memories of Fake News Stories”, half of the
subjects were given a fake news story to read [13]. Five weeks
later, the exposed subjects did not only ﬁnd it to be more
believable than the control group, but they were even more
likely to believe that they actually heard the story from a source
outside of the experiment. But most famous in this context
might be the groundbreaking work by American psychologist
Elizabeth Loftus. Her team has done extensive research on
‘false memories’, and found that people’s recollection of an
episode might be corrupted even from hearing disinformation
afterwards [14]. These studies collectively show that human
memory is dynamic, susceptible to disinformation, and can
easily integrate fake news as genuine facts – even to the extent
of one’s personal history.
Regrettably though, efforts of veriﬁcation seldomly ﬁnd
their way to the audience most susceptible to fake news [8].
Fact checking, dismissing false claims and disposing of mis-
and disinformation are at the core of scientiﬁc practice. It
is therefore hard to overstate the shock that went through
the academic world when Dutch social psychologist Diederik
Stapel was found to have engaged in large scale fact fraud,
and as of 2019, almost 60 of his publications have been
retracted [15] [16]. Since then, veriﬁcation and the replicability
of research is seriously gaining traction, as witnessed in the
expansive work described in a publication by 24 authors
reproducing 21 social science studies from Nature and Science
[17]. But also economic disciplines do not escape scrutiny and
more recently, even famous computer science experiments are
being rigorously replicated, and even extended [18] [19]. An
interesting related development is the observation by Sacha
Epskamp from University of Amsterdam, that shows fast-paced
development of methodological developments and software
implementations might both facilitate and undermine repli-
cability [20]. Though Epskamp does not explicitly quantify
the term ‘fast-paced’, it is an interesting observation that the
pace of development appears to be speeding up in scientiﬁc
replicability too.
With a much more light-hearted objective, we aim to
contribute to the practice of fact ﬁnding by checking whether
Bach’s Double Violin Concerto is indeed being performed at
an ever faster pace, such as reported by Rolling Stone and
others. We will also investigate the more general claim that
Bach’s other compositions (or indeed all classical music) are
speeding up by analyzing his other two Violin Concertos, the
six Brandenburg Concertos, six well-known cantatas, the six
Trio Sonatas for Organ and the six Suites for Cello Solo.
Together, these categories cover a broad variety of compo-
sitions with variations in ensemble sizes, instrumentations and
‘compositional details’, such as polyphony, the number of
movements, and whether dedicated to liturgical service or
attaining a more secular occasion. We retrieve data for a total
of 19,660 Bach recordings released between 1950 and 2019
and analyze the historical development of their duration.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section II,
the methods for retrieving and analyzing the releases of Bach’s
works are detailed. The results of this analysis are presented
in Section III, where we also discuss possible explanations for
the found results. Finally, the conclusions of our research are
laid out in Section IV.

containing more than 11 million Digital Data Locations (DDL)
for audio recordings such as CD’s, vinyl, digital bootlegs and
promotional releases [21]. It is publicly accessible and offers
an open Application Programming Interface (API), which
can be used to query the database, making it suitable for
quantitative analysis of historical releases [22]. Since Discogs
offers a large quantity of different types of recordings, this
source forms a valid representation of recordings from this
era.
In order to retrieve the DDLs from Discogs, a search query
is ﬁrst sent to the API containing a search term (e.g., “BWV
1043”) which then returns a list of DDLs. Each DDL contains
a pointer to the information from exactly one release, which
can then be downloaded separately to obtain details about the
recording.
Since Discogs is widely accessible without central moder-
ation, the retrieved data might be invalid, incorrect or incom-
plete. One can therefore hardly escape the laborious task of
manually sifting through the data returned by the API after
issuing a query. To be suitable for analysis, the DDL has to
meet three requirements:
•
The DDL’s data must include a year of release;
•
The DDL’s data must contain the entire work, and
not just a single movement;
•
Every used track in the DDL’s data must contain a
valid value in their duration ﬁeld.
In order to (in)validate the results research reported by
the various news media from Section I, we retrieved a total
of 1120 releases from between 1958 and 2018 of Bach’s
Double Violin Concerto. After manually ﬁltering the DDLs,
169 valid, complete and correct data records were used for
linear regression, plotting duration against year of release
(see Table I). The applied method is as follows: for dataset
D, containing the DDLs with their years of release x and
associated durations y, a straight line
f(x) = a · x + b
(1)
is ﬁtted, where x denotes the year for which the ﬁt is
calculated. Values for a and b are calculated by
a =
P
i∈D ((xi − mean(x) · (yi − mean(y))
P
i∈D ((xi − mean(x))2)
(2)
b = mean(y) − a · mean(x).
(3)
For the Double Violin Concerto, the three movements
(Vivace, Largo ma non tanto and Allegro) were also analyzed
separately. To compare results to Bach’s other two violin
concertos, 893 and 901 releases for BWV 1041 and BWV 1042
from between 1955 and 2018 were retrieved, from which 149
and 149 suitable data records were analyzed in similar fashion
(see Table III).
Widening the scope, we extended the investigation to four
more compositional categories, some of which are very dif-
ferent from the violin concertos. The second category, the six
Brandenburg Concertos, BWV 1046 - 1051 are compositions
of ensemble sizes comparable tot the violin concertos, but
with very different instrumentations including oboes, fagottos,
trumpets, horns and “echo ﬂutes”. For this category, we
retrieved 6590 DDLs of which 1477 (equalling 22.41%) were
usable after manually ﬁltering the data.
Third was a collection of six popular cantatas (BWV 106,
131, 140, 170, 173 and 208), compositions that involve vocal
soloists, duets and choirs. Though ensemble sizes can vary
considerably from one recording to the next, cantatas are
usually performed by signiﬁcantly more musicians than both
the violin and Brandenburg concertos. This speciﬁc selection
of cantatas was partially enforced by the Discogs API which
does not facilitate preﬁx free queries, and by the number
of DDLs available for each cantata, which might reﬂect its
popularity (see Table I). Although very many of the retrieved
cantata DDLs contained a value for ‘year’, very few of those
also had a value for ‘duration’, thereby still resulting in high
dismissal; of 3471 retrieved DDLs, only 147 yielded suitable
data, a mere 4.24%.
The fourth category was made up by the six Trio Sonatas
for Organ, BWV 525 - 530. Although performed by only one
musician, Bach’s organ compositions can be considered to be
of ‘near-equal complexity’ to his concertos; in fact, organ-solo
arrangements exist for several of Bach’s concertos, including
BWV 1043. For this category, we retrieved 2983 DDLs of
which 315 were usable after ﬁltering, corresponding to a post-
ﬁlter usability of 10.56%.
The ﬁfth and ﬁnal category is made up by data records for
the six Cello Suites, BWV 1007 - 1012. These works, written
for a single cellist only, largely consist of isolated melody
lines accompanied by the accidental harmonization. Though
Bach somehow managed to weave a sophisticated polyphonic
style even in these sparse compositions, they are undoubtedly
belong to the ‘smallest’ of Bach’s works. This category holds

593 data points after ﬁltering, which corresponds to 16.02%
of 3702 retrieved DDLs.
A subset of the retrieved entries from the ﬁltered data set
contained a value in the “country” ﬁeld, indicating where the
release was originally issued. Even though many individual
countries are too thinly represented for signiﬁcant analysis,
collectively the values might provide some additional insight
into our data (see Table II). We separately analyzed the West
European releases, and categorized all others as either non-
West European or ‘unknown’. Finally, all data used for the
calculations in this section has been made publicly available
for reproduction, replication and further investigation of our
results [23].
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
From the analysis as reported in Section II, it appears
out that the reported speedup of the Double Violin Concerto
contains a grain of truth, be it a tiny one. With a 5.31%
decrease in duration over 169 recordings from between 1958
and 2018, performances of the work have indeed sped up
slightly in the past 60 years (see Table III). This effect is not
conﬁned to any single one of its movements, with the duration
of the Vivace decreasing by 5.09%, the Largo decreasing
by 3.63% and the ﬁnal Allegro movement decreasing by
8.45%. The speedup of this concerto however, is much more
prominent in West European releases (10.74%) than in non-
West European releases (4.85%) (see Figure 2). But the pattern
is not entirely uniform across the violin concertos as a category.
Although like the Double Concerto, recordings of the Violin
Concerto in E Major, BWV 1042 sped up, by an average of
7.40% between 1955 and 2018, recordings the Violin Concerto
in A Minor, BWV 1041 are actually slowing down on average,
with a duration increase of 0.40% over the same period.
The Brandenburg Concertos are the only category in this
investigation which have consistently been speeding up in
recent history. But whereas the recordings of all concertos
show a decrease in duration between 1953 and 2018, there
are signiﬁcant differences between the individual concertos,
with BWV 1048 showing a double-digit decrease in duration
and BWV 1047 a mere 3.19%. But in this category too, the
speedup appears to be mainly a West European phenomenon,
with two of the concertos slowing down in non-West European
releases. The six cantatas of this study show a rather eccentric
pattern; although BWV 106, 131, 140 and especially BWV
173 show signiﬁcant speedups, the other two (BWV 170 and
208) show a moderate slowdown in the period from 1957 to
2018.
Quite contrarily to the Violin and Brandenburg Concertos,
recordings of the Trio Sonatas for Organ have slowed down
considerably around the world. Showing an average increase
in duration of 7.15% between 1950 and 2018, the only outlier
in this category is BWV 529, which shows a slight decrease of
3.98% in duration. Similarly, the Cello Suites have also slowed
down up in recent history. On average, the duration recordings
of these works have increased by 3.30%. Here, only BWV
1008 shows a decrease in duration of 8.29%, whereas BWV
1012 slowed down 10.87%. Moreover, the only speedups of
these works are found in West European recordings; the rest
of the world is actually slowing down.
The geographical origin of the releases appears to be an
important indicator for its tempo development. Of the 27
compositions we analyzed, 18 compositions (66.6%) have
increased in speed of performance in West European releases.
However, the non-West European releases of the same 27
compositions, less than half (13 performances, 48.1%) could
be conﬁrmed speeding up. Three cantatas have insufﬁcient
non-European data though; excluding these brings the total
to 13 out of 24 (54.2%). These numbers give rise to the
interesting question if (or why) the speedups and slowdowns
are related to the speciﬁc location, demographic or culture
in which a release is being issued. But still, even for the
works with the largest speedup across all categories in this
investigation, cantata “Erh¨ohtes Fleisch und Blut”, BWV 173,
the decline in duration (18.39%) is nowhere near the 30%
ﬁgure reported by the Rolling Stone and others.
The root of the difference might be the sparsity of the
source data. The ﬁndings as presented by Rolling Stone were
based on just three releases of BWV 1043: the version by
David & Igor Oistrakh (1961, 17:15), one by Arthur Grumiaux
& Herman Krebbers (1978, 15:42) and most recently Nemanja
Radulovic & Tijana Milosevic (2016, 12:34), indeed showing a
27.06% decrease in duration. However, if we cherry pick three
different releases from Discogs roughly covering the same era
(Milstein & Morini (1965, 15:40), Suske & Kr¨ohner (1980,
16:42), Menuhin & Oistrakh (2016, 18:41)), the duration
actually shows an increase of 19.19%. So, it seems that a
set of three data points is simply too small for any deﬁnitive
conclusions.
Music is changing though. A paper by Serra et al. [24]
studied contemporary popular music between 1955 and 2010
using the Million Song Dataset [25]. By analyzing pitch, loud-
ness and timbre, the researchers conclude that contemporary
popular music develops towards less variety in pitch transitions
and a more uniform timbre. Especially the loudness of pop
songs has increased between 1965 and 2005, a trend which
is sometimes dubbed the “loudness war, a terminology that is
used to describe the apparent competition to release recordings
with increasing loudness, perhaps with the aim of catching
potential customers attention” [24].

Figure 2. Speed development in Bach’s (Double) Violin Concertos over the period 1955 - 2018. Generally speaking, both for the Double Concerto (Figures 2g,
2h and 2i) and the Violin Concerto in E Major (Figures 2d, 2e and 2f), newer releases tend to be faster, but the effect is much stronger in Western Europe than
elsewhere. The Violin Concerto in A Minor (Figures 2a, 2b and 2c) actually slows down a bit, even though both regional subsets speed up slightly.
In a report by Hubert L´eveill´e Gauvin, 303 U.S. top-10
singles from the period between 1986 and 2015 have been
compared on various temporal properties like overall tempo
(measured in BPM), time before the ﬁrst lyrics, and time before
the title is ﬁrst mentioned. The study found that “attention-
grabbing [tempo] principles” such as overall speed increased
signiﬁcantly, possibly driven by the “attention economy” [26].
But the speedup here is different, because classical music
involves new recordings of the same old ‘songs’, whereas for
most U.S. pop songs are ﬁrst releases. Furthermore, their data
set covers American pop songs, which are technically speaking
from a different culture than West European classical music,
so a deﬁnite relation is hard to forge. Still, the speedup in
pop songs for the hypothesized purpose of attention-grabbing
is too alluring to be left unnoticed in light of our ﬁndings.
And how could demographics play a role in the speedup of
some of Bach’s works? Is the “pace of life” or the “speedup
of society” to blame, as mentioned by the (experts in) various
news media? There is some relevant scientiﬁc research. In a
study by Levine and Norenzayan, the average pace of life,
measured in walking speed, working speed, and the accuracy
of clocks, has been investigated for 31 countries [27]. The
researchers found signiﬁcantly higher values in both Japan and
the countries of Western Europe. The famous study “Growth,
Innovation, Scaling, and the Pace of Life in Cities” by Betten-
court et al. shows that the population size of a city is positively
related to its pace of social life [28]. With ever increasing
numbers living in urban areas over the last century, especially
in Western Europe, this would imply that the regional pace of
social life is increasing accordingly [29]. The recent explosive
growth of urbanization now has 80% of the European popula-
tion living in urban areas, especially in Northern and Western
parts [30]. A particularly interesting detail about this study, by
Marc Antrop from University of Ghent, is that it covers an era

from 1950, which largely coincides with ours. These ﬁndings
therefore provide an interesting hypothesis, worthy of further
exploration in future work.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored the historical tempo development
in performances of Bach’s Double Violin Concerto, and of
his compositions in general, following several online news
reports which claimed signiﬁcant speedups. We found these
claims to be questionable on several points. Even though
the Double Concerto has sped up slightly during the last
decades, several other compositions slowed down, so there
is no general trend for Bach’s work, let alone for classical
music as a whole. Interesting discovery is that the speedup of
this concerto is most prominent in West European releases,
but the pervasiveness of this pattern across musical genres
is yet to be conﬁrmed. Future work could therefore entail
similar investigations for other composers, such as Palestrina,
Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms, Tchaikovsky and
Rachmaninoff, covering a broader range of styles, historical
periods and topographical provenance. If sufﬁcient amounts
of data are available, such an investigation could shed more
light on the ubiquity of the ﬁndings from this investigation.
Summarizing, some categories of Bach’s music tend to
speed up somewhat, but predominantly, sometimes even ex-
clusively, in West European releases. Could this phenomenon
be related to the high pace of life in cities, and therefore simply
ride along the increasing urbanization since the ﬁfties? Or is
it the intensifying race for attention that increases the meter
of the metronome? Our lives are moving faster, our attention
spans shorter, and our music tries to keep the pace. It seems
like a plausible theory, but more evidence is needed to not
dismiss this hypothesis as fake news.
