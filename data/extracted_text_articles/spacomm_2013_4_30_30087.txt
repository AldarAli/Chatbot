Abstract—A multi-antenna global navigation satellite system
receiver accepts many radio-frequency inputs simultaneously.
Then, many antennas can be deployed on a vehicle and the
receiver can decide which one is useful for the reception of
each satellite´s signal. As a consequence, navigation solutions
can be obtained in more adverse conditions, but at the cost of
an important increase of the receiver complexity. Particularly,
tracking of the satellite signals is a challenging task in these
receivers, especially when a variation in the vehicle´s attitude
impose a change in the antenna used for a satellite signal
reception. Carrier tracking is critical during these changes of
antenna since the distance between them is larger than the signal
wavelength. Thus, a direct antenna commutation can produce
important tracking transients that degrade the navigation mea-
surements, affect data demodulation, and can produce a loss of
signal tracking. The strategy presented in this work allows the
receiver to keep tracking during these antenna commutations
avoiding the detrimental tracking transients. Since it is based on
close-loop schemes, it is suitable for real-time receivers due to
their low computational complexity. The proposed technique is
tested in a simulated low-earth orbit satellite scenario assuming a
constant change of attitude due to a roll movement along the orbit
direction vector. It is shown that a four-antenna receiver using
the proposed tracking strategy can properly track the satellites
in view, in spite of the frequent antenna commutations imposed
by the vehicle´s rotation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers allow
the real-time computation of a vehicle´s position and velocity,
generally referred as navigation solutions. For this purpose
the receiver has to detect, track and demodulate at least
four signals broadcasted from the satellites of the system
constellation [1]. Currently, the two operative GNSS systems
are the Global Position System (GPS), supported by the United
States, and GLONASS developed by Russia that has been
completely operational since 1995. Typical GNSS applications
rely on a single antenna for satellite signals reception [2].
Since usual antenna radiation patterns are hemispherical, the
antenna location in the vehicle must be properly chosen
to maximize satellite visibility. Therefore, single-antenna re-
ceivers are useful only if the vehicle´s attitude does not
depart signiﬁcantly from their assumed values, as is often
the case with cars, planes and ships. However, this is not the
case for other applications where the vehicle´s attitude does
change considerably, like during the ﬂight of some satellites
and rockets. Since vehicle dimensions are larger than the
signal wavelength, the direct combination of multiple antennas
creates interference patterns that preclude proper receiver
operation. A multi-antenna receiver is required in these cases
[3]. This kind of receiver can also be used for vehicle´s attitude
determination [1], and currently they are also being proposed
for usual GNSS applications because better interference and
multipath mitigation techniques can be applied [4].
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) signals are uti-
lized in GNSS because they allow high time-resolution. There-
fore, a correlation stage is needed at the receiver to de-
spread them and obtain reasonable signal-to-noise ratios [1].
Tight code and carrier synchronization of the local replica is
required to achieve the de-spreading. Typically, tracking loop
schemes are adopted for code and carrier synchronization in
real-time receivers due to their low computational complexity.
We assume a multi-antenna receiver architecture where the
signal from each antenna is correlated individually. The same
code and carrier local replica is used for all the signals
from different antennas when receiving a particular satellite
signal, assuming the multi-correlator channel scheme of [4].
However, since the goal in this work is maximizing satellite
visibility and not interference and/or multipath mitigation,
the beamforming approach is not considered. Then, only the
antenna that produces the highest signal-to-noise ratio will be
used for the tracking of a given satellite.
Considering that the distance between the antennas de-
ployed on a vehicle is in the order of meters and the carrier
wavelength is approximately 0.2 meters, an antenna commu-
tation can be unnoticed by a code loop but can severely affect
a phase loop. The degradation caused by this effect to the
GNSS satellite data demodulation and some techniques to cope
with it has been recently reported on [5]. The sudden change
in the input phase can be avoided if that phase difference
can be properly measured before the commutation actually
occurs. In this case, the radiation patterns of deployed antennas
should have a signiﬁcant overlapping to assure continuous
satellite visibility under vehicle´s attitude changes. Then, there
should be enough signal-to-noise ratio at the second best
antenna to measure the phase difference accurately before the
moment when this antenna becomes the best and the tracking
loop should change its input and use the new signal. In this
work, we propose to use an auxiliary carrier tracking loop
to estimate the differences between the signals coming from

the best antenna and the second best one. In this way, the
phase transient are completely avoided, the quality of phase
measures preserved, and the data demodulation unaltered.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A digital
model for the output of the correlation of the received GNSS
signal from multiples antennas with the same code and carrier
local replica is presented in Section 2. The proposed carrier
tracking strategy is presented in Section 3. The proposed
scheme is tested in a simulated low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite
scenario in Section 4. The tracking transient effects found
if a single carrier loop scheme is used, and their absence
when the two-loop strategy is adopted, are veriﬁed. Finally,
the conclusions and future work lines are given in Section 5.
II. DIGITAL MEASUREMENTS MODEL
Consider that N antennas have been deployed on a vehicle
and connected to a multi-antenna GNSS receiver. According
to the receiver architecture described in the previous section,
the signal received at each antenna must be correlated with
the same locally generated replica for each visible satellite.
The complex correlations of the incoming signal at the i-th
antenna, from a given satellite and for the k-th correlation
interval of duration T, can be expressed as [1]

where i = 1, ..., N, C/N0|i
k is the carrier power to noise power
spectral density of the signal from antenna i, ∆τ i
k = τ i
k −ˆτk is
the code delay estimation error, ∆f i
k = f i
k− ˆfk is the frequency
estimation error, both assumed constant during the integration
time, and ∆θi
k = θi
k − ˆθk is the initial phase estimation error.
The term ni
k is a complex white Gaussian noise sequence with
unit variance, assumed independent between antennas, R(·) is
the code correlation function, and sinc(x) = sin(πx)/(πx).
This expression assumes that the binary data bits Dk = ±1
are the same in all the antenna signals –given the slow data
rate, e.g., 50 bps for GPS– and that correlations are computed
within the same bit period. This type of binary data modulation
is present in the GPS and GLONASS civil signals and in
the data components of composite modernized GNSS signals.
Notice that the estimated values, which corresponds to the
local-replica, are the same in the correlations of different
antennas, and that the carrier power to noise power spectral
density C/N0|i
k is affected by the gain of each antenna
according to the line-of-sight vector of the received satellite.
A. Phase Discrimination
After the acquisition process has been completed, i.e., in
tracking conditions [1], code and frequency estimation errors
are sufﬁciently small so that the functions sinc(·) and R(·) can
be approximated by 1. Hence, (1) becomes

and ˆφk = π ˆfkT + ˆθk, to model the input and output of the
digital carrier tracking loops [6].
The phase estimation error present in the signal of each
antenna is obtained from the angle of the corresponding
complex correlation. To avoid the effects of binary modulation,
a two quadrant discriminator should be utilized. Then,

where the notation [·]π indicates that its argument is kept
within the interval (− π

many times as needed. The noise term nφi
k has zero mean
and a complicated probability distribution. However, for high
C/N0|i
k values, it can be approximated by a Gaussian distri-
bution with zero mean and variance 1/(2TC/N0|i
k).
B. Carrier Tracking Loops
The phase error estimates obtained with (3) are ambiguous
due to the periodic nature of the phase. This ambiguity is
responsible of many of the non-linear behaviours present in
phase locked loops (PLL). Due to these non-linearities the PLL
can have very long lock-in times and low resistance to high
dynamics, and therefore many GNSS receivers add a frequency
locked loop (FLL) in a scheme called FLL-assisted-PLL [7].
In previous works we have proposed an alternative solution,
called the unambiguous frequency aided (UFA) PLL [6]. In the
UFA-PLL, the ambiguous phase discriminator values, ei
k, are
corrected by adding or subtracting an integer number of π. The
corrected phase errors, ui
k, are found such that the difference
between two successive values is less than a quarter of a cycle
in magnitude. Thus, starting with ui
0 = ei
0, it must be hold that
ui
k = ei
k − Iπ(ei
k − ui
k−1)
(4)
where Iπ(x) = x − [x]π is like the integer part function,
but with steps at the multiples of π. The obtained sequence
of phase errors ui
k has unambiguous values as long as the
frequency error is lower than 1/(4T). We have also shown
that the UFA-PLL has the same noise resistance, and so the
same tracking threshold, that an equivalent FLL [8].
Through the rest of this work, the utilized carrier loop is
the UFA-PLL shown in Figure 1 whose ﬁlter coefﬁcients
are p1
= C
= 0.5, p2
= 0.105, and p3
= 0.0123.
For the correlation time, T = 5ms, the resulting PLL has
an equivalent noise bandwidth of 75.6Hz. The two delays
included in the loop model the real-time calculation of the
correlations. One of them accounts for the time spent in the
computation itself, and the second is present because the
estimated values utilized to produce the local-replica used
in the correlation have to be known before the calculations
begin. That is, the estimated value ˆφk is obtained with the
loop ﬁlter output of the (k − 1)-th correlation interval, which
in turn is calculated with the estimated value ˆφ(k−2). The loop
ﬁlter is optimized for the tracking of acceleration steps, which
produces a quadratic ramp of phase at the loop input. This loop
design has been implemented in experimental GPS receivers

loop models previously described can be used operating data-
bits synchronously as typically done, but can also be extended
for data-bit asynchronous operation as proposed in [10].
III. THE TWO LOOPS TRACKING STRATEGY
Assume the receiver is tracking a given satellite at the
antenna l and that, due to the change in the vehicle´s attitude,
the C/N0|l
k values are decreasing and the C/N0|j
k values,
at the antenna j, are increasing. For the sake of simplicity,
assume that the rest of the antennas has no useful signal levels.
The correlations are computed based on the loop estimates
computed with the signal from antenna l, but the error between
the phase loop estimate and the phase of the signal from
antena j can also be obtained as long as the C/N0|j
k values
are sufﬁciently high. This new phase error is

where ∆φj

a new loop to track the signal from antenna j should be
calculated with respect to a different phase estimate. However,
if we assume that the frequency estimates from both loops are
sufﬁciently close, the new phase error can be obtained from (5)
by correcting it with the difference between both loop phase
estimates. If we call ˆφM

actual loop or master loop, the phase error of an auxiliary

The [·]π operation is needed to obtain a phase error in the same
range of values than the produced by a two quadrant inverse
tangent. Notice that in the previous cases this operation was
used to model the ambiguity of the measured phase error, but
now it has to be actually implemented as part of the signal
processing needed for the new auxiliary loop, which has input
φj
k and output ˆφA
k . The loop ﬁlter used for the auxiliary loop
is exactly the same that the one used in the master loop. The
reason for this choice will be clear in the following subsection.
A. Master Loop Actualization
Assume that the auxiliary loop has already been started
and its initial transient, due to the initial phase and frequency
errors, is already extinguished. Also assume that at the present
moment the measured power at the antenna l becomes lower
than the one at the antenna j. At this point the loop with
the best estimates is the auxiliary one, and there is no reason
to keep using the same loop estimates as parameters for
the local-replica. Then, the master loop internal variables are
overwritten by the ones from the auxiliary loop, and from now
on its input is taken from the j antenna. In this way, the master
loop is again tracking the best antenna, and the change has
not produced any transient. Therefore, the logic for the master
loop actualization is simple: each time that the power on the
auxiliary loop becomes higher than the power on the master,
the input of the master loop has to be changed by the auxiliary
one. Depending on the auxiliary loop actualization logic, both
loops can be tracking the signal from the same or different
antennas. When both loops are tracking the signal from the
same antenna no master loop actualization is possible, and the
correction term of (6) becomes zero, and then eAj
k = eM j
k.
B. Auxiliary Loop Actualization
Now is clear that the aim of the auxiliary loop is to track the
signal from the second best antenna whenever it is possible.
Then, two possible situations have to be managed. The ﬁrst
is when the master loop is tracking the best antenna and the
auxiliary one is properly tracking another antenna, which is
not the second best antenna any more. That means that there
is a better signal to be tracked with the auxiliary loop. Then,
a direct commutation between these signals should be done
at this loop. Of course, this change will produce a transient
due to phase and frequency variations caused by the different
physical locations and velocities of these antennas. However,
since this loop is not generating the local-replica, the actual
signal tracking will not be affected. The second situation is
that the tracked signal in the auxiliary loop is actually the
second best, but its power is too low to guarantee a satisfactory
tracking. Then, the only possible option for the auxiliary loop
is to switch its input to the same antenna that the master one.
When this is the case, both loops should track the same signal
until the second best antenna reaches a highly enough power
level. At this point, the auxiliary loop should commute to this
new antenna. Again, this change will cause a transient in the
auxiliary loop, but it will not affect the master one.

C. Power Estimation
The strategy presented in this work needs a periodic esti-
mation of the received power level for each satellite in view
and for each antenna. This information can be obtained almost
directly from the already computed correlations, (1), assuming
that no interferences or severe signal obstructions or reﬂections
are considered. A raw estimate of the received signal power
from antenna i can be obtained as
ˆP i
k = |Ci
k|2 = (Ii
k)2 + (Qi
k)2 = T C

¯¯¯¯

+ noise .
(7)
Based on these values, better power estimates can be obtained
by temporal ﬁltering accordingly to the desired trade-off
between noise reduction and the maximum rate of change
of the ﬁltered estimates, which is in turn established by the
vehicle´s dynamics. One simple option is to take the average
of each of these values during a selected time-window.
D. Summary of the Algorithm
A commutation period should be selected according to the
expected vehicle´s dynamics, namely L = KT, with K ∈ R.
Then, every L seconds, a vector of estimated power at each
antenna should be computed,
¯P = [P[1]P[2] · · · P[N]]
(8)
where each components is obtained as described in the previ-
ous subsection. Then, this vector has to be ordered and the
two highest values and their corresponding indexes stored.
If we called b the index of the ﬁrst best antenna, and s to
the index of the second best antenna, then P[b] > P[s].
Now consider that m and a are variables that indicate the
number of the antenna selected for the master and the auxiliary
loop respectively. Then, assuming that after the acquisition
process of the satellite signal the loops are initialized with
the best and the second best antenna at that moment, the
algorithmic description –in pseudo code– of the proposed two
loops tracking strategy is presented in Table I. In this code, it
was considered that 10 dB less than the power of the signal
in the master loop is the maximum difference allowed to the
auxiliary loop to track a different signal.
IV. APPLICATION TO A LEO SATELLITE SCENARIO
In order to test the proposed tracking strategy, a LEO
satellite scenario was simulated assuming a constant change
of attitude due to a roll movement along the orbit direction
vector of 5 revolutions per minute (rpm). This kind of rotation
can be found during the ﬁrst moments of the satellite life due
to the spin stabilization used by the launching vehicles. In
this case, the signals from the GNSS satellites can arrive from
any direction. Then, the tetrahedron geometry shown in Figure
2 (a) was adopted for the placement of four antennas. The
use of such non-aligned antenna array for this type of space
application has been proposed in [11]. A typical GPS satellite
constellation was considered and the position and velocity of
each visible satellite were calculated. The same values were
obtained for each antenna attached to the LEO satellite, whose
trajectory is plotted in Figure 2 (b). Thirteen GPS satellites
were found in view during some part of the 10 minutes of
simulated trajectory. Notice that given the high velocity of the
LEO satellite, ≃ 7 km/s, the time in view of a GPS satellite
is much shorter than the found in earth applications. Based on
the position and velocity values obtained, line-of-sight vectors,
distances, and rate of change in these distances were computed
every 10 ms to generate the input signals for the following
digital processing. The change of the power level received at
each antenna is a critical aspect in this analysis and therefore
a realistic radiation pattern was considered. Since the GPS
signals are radiating using right-handed circularly-polarized
(RHCP) signals, the gain pattern of a typical patch antenna at
the GPS L1 band (1575 MHz) was considered. The antenna
gain pattern adopted is shown in Figure 2 (c).
A. Carrier tracking loop simulation
The loop simulations made are based on the correlation
output model of (1). Then, the inputs required for each antenna
and visible satellite are the carrier power to noise power
spectral density, C/N0|i
k, the instantaneous carrier frequency
f i
k and the instantaneous input phase, θi
k. Since the code loops
are not considered in this work, perfect code estimation is
assumed. Neglecting second order terms, the instantaneous
phase of the received signal can be obtained directly dividing
the distance from the GPS satellite to the considered receiver´s
antenna by the carrier wavelength, which is λ ≃ 19 cm for the
GPS L1 frequency. In the same way, the frequency changes can
be obtained considering only the Doppler effect, i.e., dividing
the rate of change of the distance by λ. Finally, the gain factor
GRHCP , obtained with the line-of-sight vector and the gain
pattern of the antennas, is converted into carrier power to noise
power spectral density, according to
C/N0|i
k[dB] = GRHCP [dB] + 42[dB/Hz]
(9)
where the value 42 dB/Hz, was obtained considering 2 dB
of antenna losses, equivalent noise temperature of the antenna
130K, cable losses of 0.4dB and receiver noise ﬁgure of 1 dB.
B. Simulation results
The results presented in the ﬁrst place correspond to a single
loop tracking strategy. It simply consists on changing the loop
input each time that the receiver detects that a better signal
is available from another antenna. Only the results obtained
with the tracking of one of the GPS satellites in view are
presented due to space limitations. In Figure 3 (a), the C/N0

levels of the signals received with each of the four antennas
are plotted, for the ﬁrst 30 seconds of the simulation, together
with the indication of which antenna was used as input to the
loop. A time-window of 0.25 seconds was selected for the
power estimation average. The correct antenna selection made
based on this power estimates, and the delay imposed by the
averaging process can be clearly appreciated. The phase and
frequency errors of the loop are presented in Figures 3 (b) and
(c). Besides the ﬁrst transient caused by the loop initialization,
it can be clearly noticed the presence of a phase and frequency
transients caused by the loop input commutations. Notice
that half-cycle ambiguities present in the phase error were
removed to appreciate the tracking error in a proper scale.
These ambiguities can be easily compensated by the receiver,
allowing continuous and reliable data demodulation.
The results obtained in the same situation but using the
proposed two-loops tracking strategy are presented in Figure
4. In Figure 4 (a) the indication of the antennas selected as
the input for the master and the auxiliary loops are plotted. It
can be noticed that the master loop uses as input practically
the same antenna that it would be used by the single loop.
However, since its signal has been already tracked by the
auxiliary loop, at the time of commutation the master loop
can be properly initialized, and correspondingly a transient-
free response is obtained as depicted in Figures 4 (b) and (c).
Finally, it can be also appreciated that the estimation error
levels change accordingly with the variation of the C/N0
values of the tracked signal, as expected.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
An efﬁcient tracking strategy devised for real-time multi-
antenna GNSS receivers has been presented. The considered
receiver architecture computes the correlations of the signal
from each antenna with a common local-replica, for each
tracked satellite. The use of a single carrier tracking loop in
this kind of receiver will cause transient errors each time a
commutation of the antenna used as loop input is done. These
transients degrade the navigation measurements, affect data
demodulation, and can produce a loss of signal tracking. The
two-loop proposed strategy avoids these transients by properly
modifying the internal loop variables at the moments of the
commutations. The values of these variables are obtained by
a second, twin loop, which does not require the calculation of
extra correlations. The proposed strategy has been described
in detail and tested in a simulated four-antenna LEO satellite
scenario verifying that all the GPS satellites in view can
be continuously tracked in the adverse situation of a rolling
movement of 5 rpm.
The computational cost of the proposed strategy is minor
assuming that in a multi-antenna receiver the power estimation
and antenna selection algorithm is mandatory. Given the inher-
ent increase of complexity of managing many radio-frequency
inputs coherently, their digitalization, and the computation of
the multi-correlations simultaneously, the cost of the extra
loop seems negligible. The authors are now working on
that multi-correlator architecture to be implemented in ﬁeld
programmable gate arrays (FPGA), and in the design of an
experimental multi-antenna GNSS receiver.
