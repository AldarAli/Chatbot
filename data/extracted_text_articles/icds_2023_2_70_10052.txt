Abstract—Accessibility links are an established tool for the 
digital inclusion of users with disabilities. In this paper, the 
theoretical lens of coloniality is employed to problematise the 
role of accessibility links as potentially contributing to 
entrenching offline classifications and hierarchies, leading to a 
separate and sometimes inferior user experience. Practical 
examples are used to highlight three key issues. In conclusion, 
there is an argument for the need for a decolonial model, to be 
developed in a dedicated future publication.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Within decolonial scholarship, the term coloniality refers 
to the persistent legacy of marginalisation, oppression and 
exploitation of former colonial subjects long after the end of 
historical colonialism. Originally coined by Peruvian 
Sociologist Annibal Quijano to problematise global power 
relationships [1], uses of the term have been extended to 
explore issues of race [2], gender [3], citizenship  [4] and 
others, including disability [5][6]. It should be noted that, 
unlike other terms, the latter does not refer to a dimension of 
diversity encompassing both privileged and disadvantaged 
categories (e.g., males and females with regard to gender), 
but rather signal a deviation from the "norm" [7]. For this 
reason, wordings such as (dis)ability are preferable. In this 
paper, I reflect on accessibility links to highlight how 
coloniality of (dis)ability is reproduced in the online domain. 
While extensive literature in the field of Human-Computer 
Interactions exists concerning the inclusion of people with 
disabilities [8], questions remain as to how such users are 
included. In advancing a decolonial perspective, I highlight 
the persistent legacy of accessibility as an afterthought, best 
effort and accommodation rather than truly empowering and 
liberating. In this paper, I discuss the link between 
accessibility and coloniality and highlight three key issues.   
 
II. 
ACCESSIBILITY LINKS AND COLONIALITY 
Accessibility links are links, often found at the very top 
of a Web page, which redirect a user with a disability to a 
specific section, to additional information or to a more 
accessible version of the page. If not explicitly mandated, 
they are strongly recommended as an expression of 
adherence to sound and inclusive design principles [8]. 
Accessibility 
links 
reflect 
established 
theoretical 
understandings of disability [9]. In terms of the medical 
model, they can be understood as a remedial strategy to 
provide impaired users with a minimal level of functionality. 
In terms of the social model, they can be understood as an 
attempt to remove barriers to access and enable digital 
inclusion. The latter approach is informed by the principle of 
universal access by design, i.e., as is the case with new 
buildings in many western countries [10],  Web pages should 
be conceptualised keeping the needs of a wide range of 
diverse users in mind and avoid reproducing social forms of 
discrimination. Both models fail to tackle the existence of 
(dis)ability as a discrete category or, for that matter, a 
hierarchical relationship between able and (dis)abled 
persons, key concerns in decolonial scholarship [11]. 
Consistent with a critique of the rights-based approach as a 
form of coloniality [12],  formal compliance with 
accessibility principles does not ensure and may in fact 
hamper an equitable user experience. Accessibility links 
represent an example of how artefacts often designed by and 
for able bodies remain the product of oversimplifications 
based on formalised users and use scenarios which cannot 
capture the complexity and nuances of the disability 
experience in real life. Focusing on a set of purposively 
selected Web pages, I advocate for a decolonial model of 
disability by highlighting three issues inherent to current 
approaches. 
 
III. 
ISSUES WITH ACCESSIBILITY   
The first issue explored in this study is that accessibility 
links do not always work. Whether this is due to technical 
problems (e.g., browser compatibility) or human factors 
(e.g., 
oversight 
or 
non-implementation), 
accessibility 
solutions need to be reliable in order to be effective. Taking 
[13] as an example, even an association with a progressive 
and inclusive digital media focus can feature a broken “skip 
to main content” link as tested with Firefox on Ubuntu Linux 
20.04. 
The second issue concerns quality of experience. 
Reduced functionality or lack of some key features seems to 
be considered an acceptable trade-off in the case of users

with disabilities. While the provision of alternative and 
simplified versions of inaccessible webpages seems 
somewhat dated [14][15], even a health-focused website 
such as [16] admits to some parts of its site being 
inaccessible.   
The third issue is that accessibility features often entail 
additional work on the part of the user, e.g., familiarising 
oneself with page or service-specific features like shortcuts, 
screen readers, navigation strategies etc., or providing 
feedback and suggestions for improvement. The most 
popular website in the world, Google.com, provides an 
example. Apart from a (functioning) "skip to main content", 
the other two accessibility links point to separate 
"accessibility help" and "accessibility feedback" pages. A 
very rough but conservative estimate based on the number of 
unique users and percentage of screen reader users in the US, 
Walsh and Steele [17][18] suggest that potential users could 
spend a combined 3 million hours or more just to read the 
help page. Waste of time is recognised as one of the main 
sources of frustration for screen reader users [19]. While 
Fuchs [20] recognises free digital labour as a form of 
capitalist exploitation, Couldry and Mejias [21] highlight the 
asymmetric and coercive character of digital power 
relationships as a new form of colonialism.    
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, though no doubt useful and informed by 
noble intentions, in some cases, accessibility links reflect 
power relationships and world views shaped by coloniality in 
three fundamental ways. Firstly, decisions remain firmly in 
the hands of people without disabilities with relatively little 
recourse. Secondly, inclusion is achieved through a separate 
and often inferior experience. Thirdly, an additional burden 
in terms of limited features, frustration and extra learning is 
normalised for people with disabilities. While an exhaustive 
articulation of a decolonial model of digital inclusion goes 
beyond the scope of the present paper, it is important to 
problematise accessibility links as potential contributors to 
users with disabilities' permanent state of dependency, 
ghettoisation and suffering, which are the hallmarks of the 
Global South as a shared subaltern condition rather than a 
geographical entity.
