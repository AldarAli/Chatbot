Abstract—In this paper, SiNx polygonal resonator is carefully
simulated for an optical sensor. The polygonal resonator has
recently attracted much attention for application in bio and
chemical sensors because it does not have a bending loss, which
can be fabricated with high integration rate, and it has an
advantage of using Multi Mode Interference (MMI) coupler. In
polygonal resonator sensor design, high Q-factor and low loss
Total Internal Reflection (TIR) mirror are important factors.
Therefore, a 125 degrees TIR mirror that has a 97%
reflectance considering the Goos-Hånchen shift and critical
angle is designed. For rib type waveguide, we designed it to
have 3 μm width, 0.5 μm height, and 0.25 μm etching depth. 
Regarding the simulation results of Finite Domain Time
difference (FDTD) method, the Q-factor of SiNx polygonal
resonator was 5736 and Free Spectral Range (FSR) was 16.3
nm. When we changed the refractive index, the shift of the
peak was 26.5 nm/Refractive Index Unit (RIU).

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, optical resonators have been researched
for their use as sensors and filter devices. When using these
optical resonators as a biosensors, attaching antibodies on the
surface are used for monitoring the change of refractive
index after an antibody-antigen reaction. These sensors are
called
refractometric
sensors
[1]–[2]. They detect the
variation of refractive index by measuring the output power
at a fixed wavelength or shift of resonance wavelength. In
order to obtain high sensitivity, a resonator should have a
high Q-factor. The most common type of resonator is a ring
resonator [3]. However, during the fabrication progress, it
has the disadvantage of mass-production because a single
mode condition should be applied. In the ring resonator
structure, the waveguide width is too narrow to fabricate the
resonator using photolithography because the common
waveguide core material is Si, which has about 400 nm
width for a single mode waveguide. When the waveguide of
the ring resonator is at multimode, the output of the resonator
has a lot of peaks and thereby, it is not suitable to be used as
an optical sensor. For establish the single mode condition, a
common method is to design the rib type waveguide or to
use a low refractive index core material. However, bending
loss is another disadvantage of the ring resonator. It has a
high bending loss which limits the minimization of the
resonator. This disadvantage reduces the integration rate. To
overcome
these
drawbacks,
we
designed
a polygonal
resonator that does not have bending loss. Also, a polygonal
resonator can use MMI coupler. Therefore, a polygonal
resonator can be an alternative solution. In this paper, we
simulated the polygonal resonators based on SiNx material
which has a refractive index of 1.9827 at 1.55 μm 
wavelength.

Figure 2. Waveguide structure
The design of a waveguide is important because it
determines the propagation loss. Firstly, we designed the
waveguide to have a SiNx core and SiO2 cladding material.
SiNx material has a refractive index of 1.9827 at 1.55 μm 
wavelength [5] and SiO2 material has a refractive index of
1.44 at 1.55 μm wavelength [6]. As shown in Fig.2, the 
waveguide width, height and etching depth are 3 μm, 0.5 μm 
and 0.25 μm, respectively. This structure makes it possible to 
fabricate the resonator using a contact aligner that costs
lower and has a higher productivity than using e-beam
lithography. We also designed a TIR mirror which is a
significant factor for the polygonal resonator. The critical
angle
and
Goos-Hanchen
shift
should
be
considered
carefully in designing a TIR mirror [7]. The critical angle of
the SiNx waveguide structure is 46.57 degrees and the
estimated value of the Goos-Hånchen shift is calculated
about 200 nm. The designed TIR mirror has an angle of 125
degrees and the reflectance is 97% as shown in Fig.3.
According to the simulation, there are 5 Transverse Electric
(TE)
and
Transverse
Magnetic
(TM)
modes
in
the
waveguide structure because of its wide width. However, the
surface roughness of the SiNx waveguide and the long path
length of the resonator make higher order modes disappear.
Therefore, the output of the polygonal resonator has a single
mode electric field.

POLYGONAL RESONATOR
The polygonal resonator is an attractive structure because
it has no bending loss and MMI coupler can be applied for
use. These advantages make fabrication easier than the ring
type resonator. However, sophisticated TIR mirror design
should be required for low bending loss of the polygonal
resonator. In the designed TIR mirror, each TIR mirror has
3% loss, so the total resonator loss is about 22%. Using
equation (3), a 50:50 coupler is needed for high on-off ratio.
Therefore, we designed 50:50 MMI coupler, which has 193
μm length. The total length of the polygonal resonator is 
800 μm. The simulation results of the octagonal resonator is 
shown in Fig. 4. The results showed that the Q-factor of the
polygonal resonator was 5736 and the FSR was 16.3 nm.
When the refractive index was changed, the shift of the peak
was 26.5 nm/RIU.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we designed a polygonal resonator as an
optical sensor. In contrast to ring resonators, having no
bending loss and using MMI are the advantages of polygonal
resonator. These advantages increase the integration rate and
make fabrication easier. Also, wide width waveguide can be
fabricated through photolithography just as a contact aligner.
The polygonal resonator will be a good solution to overcome
the disadvantages of a ring type resonator.
