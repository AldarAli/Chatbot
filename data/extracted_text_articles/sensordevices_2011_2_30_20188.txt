Abstract—The method of total spectroscopic ellipsometry in its 
total internal reflection (TIRE) mode was utilized in this work 
for the study of protein-protein interaction. Two different 
systems were studied here: (i) the interaction of chaperones, 
such as heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp81 with different 
chaperone receptors including the new one OEP61-TM; (ii) the 
aggregation of alpha-synuclein monomers and oligomers 
(involved 
in 
Parkinson’s 
diseases) 
in 
phospholipid  
membranes. The method of TIRE provides unique quantified 
information on such protein interaction. Changes in the 
effective thickness of adsorbed molecular layer obtained by 
fitting the single TIRE spectra allows us to quantify the 
process of binding of chaperons to receptors or aggregation of 
alpha-synuclein in the lipid membrane. TIRE dynamic 
measurements allow monitoring protein interaction in-situ and 
evaluate the association (affinity) constants of such interaction. 
TIRE study revealed a clear separation between specific and 
non-specific interaction of proteins; such data were reported 
for the first time.  A complementary method of atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) was used in this work to visualize the 
protein build-up on the surface.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
This work is dedicated to the study protein-protein 
interaction, a problem which is far from being extensively 
studied and fully understood, as compared to more 
established fields of immune and enzyme reactions. Two 
examples are studied in our work: first, the interaction of 
chaperone proteins with respective receptors extracted from 
plants, and second, the study of aggregation of α-synuclein, 
a peptide involved in Parkinson’s disease.  
Chaperone proteins play an important role in cells 
protecting proteins from high temperatures and other cellular 
stresses, stabilizing protein structure and preventing them 
from aggregation and degradation. It was recently suggested 
that molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins 
Hsp70 and Hsp81, can form complexes with freshly 
translated proteins and thus prevent their aggregation [1]. 
Furthermore, the recent finding of chaperone receptors in 
plants [2] indicates more specific involvement of molecular 
chaperones in protein targeting. The study of the 
mechanisms of protein targeting may have a substantial 
impact in a number of applications including the origin of 
neurological diseases.  
The problem of aggregation of α-synuclein in lipid 
membranes was identified as the main mechanism of 
Parkinson’s 
disease 
development. 
These 
α-synuclein 
oligomers are thought to be the toxic entities responsible for 
bring about cell death, and similar oligomers have also been 
implicated in a range of other disease states. One of the 
possible mechanisms of α-synuclein build-up is the 
penetration of oligomeric α-synuclein into the membrane as 
opposed to resting on the surface. This is a novel mechanism 
that indicates cellular toxicity can be caused by punching 
holes through the membrane.  
Physical methods such as total internal reflection 
ellipsometry (TIRE) can compliment traditional biological 
methods of studying protein-protein interaction and provide 
necessary quantification of such interactions. The method of 
(TIRE) was selected here because of its high sensitivity to 
molecular 
adsorption [3] 
and its recent successful 
applications in bio-sensing [4-6]. The results of TIRE study 
of interaction of chaperones (Hsp70 and Hsp81) with the 
novel plant chaperone receptor OEP61 are presented here for 
the first time. The method of atomic force microscopy was 
exploited in this work as a complimentary technique of 
visualizing protein aggregates on the surface; it was 
successfully implemented here for direct observation of α-
synuclein oligomers in lipid membranes.

TEXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND SAMPLES 
PREPARATION  
The experimental set-up for total internal reflection 
ellipsometry (TIRE), schematically shown in Fig. 1a, is 
based upon commercial M2000 J.A. Woollam spectroscopic 
ellipsometer with the addition of a 680 glass prism which 
provides the coupling of light into a thin metal (gold) film 
[3,4]. By its geometry, the method of TIRE closely 
resembles the technique of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
with one crucial difference of detecting two parameters of Ψ 
and ∆ in comparison to only one parameter of reflected light

Ψ and ∆ measured on bare surface of gold. Dotted line shows 
corrected (by adding 360o to negative values) of ∆(λ) spectrum.   
   
Fig. 1b shows typical spectra of Ψ and ∆; the spectrum of Ψ 
is very much similar to a traditional SPR curve, while the 
spectrum of ∆  provides a new phase related quantity not 
available in the SPR method. The method of TIRE often 
called  as “phase SPR” was proved to be much more (at least 
10 times) more sensitive than traditional SPR [3].  
Two types of TIRE measurements were performed: (i) 
Single spectroscopic scans which were carried out in the 
same Trizma-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.5) after completion 
every adsorption (binding) steps. These measurements were 
followed by fitting of TIRE spectra to the four-layer model 
and evaluation of the thickness of the molecular layer 
adsorbed on the surface of gold. The details and limitations 
of the fitting procedure were outlined in detail in our early 
publications, for example [3]; (ii) Dynamic spectral 
measurements during in which a number of Ψ and ∆ spectra 
were recorded in-situ during all adsorption (or binding) 
stages after a certain time interval; then the time 
dependences of Ψ and ∆ at a selected wavelength were 
presented and further analyzed for the purpose of studying 
the kinetics of adsorption and binding processes. Following 
the procedure outlined in detail in [4-6] the rates of 
adsorption ra and de-sorption rd were found, and the 
association KA and affinity KD constants were found as their 
ratio:

The method of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in 
tapping mode was utilized here for the study of morphology 
of adsorbed molecular layers and evaluation of the surface 
roughness of the surface. Nanoscope IIIa instrument (from 
Digital Technology) was used in a tapping mode with the 
mean oscillation frequency of 300 kHz, and scanning rate of 
1s. The radius of silicon “super sharp” tips (from Veeco) was 
about 2 nm.  
The substrates for TIRE measurements were prepared by 
thermal evaporation of a Cr layer (3 nm) on microscopic 
glass slides followed by a Au layer of (25-27nm in 
thickness) without breaking the vacuum of about 10-6 Torr 
using BOC Edwards Auto-360 vacuum system. The presence 
of thin Cr layer improves the adhesion of gold to the glass. 
Depending on the application, Cr/Au coated slides were 
treated differently to achieve the best adhesion properties for 
deposition of different molecular layers.  
For 
immobilization 
of 
chaperones 
receptors 
the 
technology of electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition [7] was 
utilized. In this case, in order to increase the negative surface 
charge on the surface, the gold layer was treated overnight in 
the 0.1 M solution of mercaptoethyl sodium sulfonate in 
methanol. Then the layer of polycations (polyallylamine 
hydrochloride or PAH) was adsorbed on the surface 
providing a positive charge required for electrostatic 
adsorption of chaperone receptors such as OEP61. 
For deposition of natural chloroplast membranes 
containing chaperone receptors the method of Langmuir-
Schaefer was used.  The monolayers of chloroplast were 
formed on the water surface in the Langmuir trough (NIMA 
mini trough) and then compressing it to a surface pressure of 
20mN/m. The layer of chloroplast was transferred onto silion 
and gold coated sample by touching the surface with a 
sample (method of horizontal lifting or Langmuir-Schaefer). 
Finally, the samples for deposition of lipid membranes 
were prepared by treating gold coated samples in cystamine 
hydrochloride solution (0.1 M solution in methanol, 
overnight treatment) to increase the positive surface change.  
The samples (solutions) of chaperone receptors (OEP61, 
HOP, HOP2A, TOC64 , chaperones (Hsp70 and Hsp81),  α-
synuclein in both monomer and oligomer forms, chloroplast 
membranes, and phospholipids were supplied by our 
collaborators from Biomedical Research Centre. The 
methodology of protein preparation was described earlier in 
detail.

taken after each step of adsorption (binding) are shown in 
Fig. 2a.  The calibration curve, e.g. the dependence of the 
thickness of adsorbed layer vs. the concentration of 
chaperones, which was obtained by fitting the ∆ spectra are

Fig. 2. (a) Typical set of ∆ spectra for bare gold surface (1), after 
adsorption of PAH (2), OEP61 receptors (3) and binding of Hsp70 
chaperones of different concentrations: 300 ng/ml (4), and 10µg/ml 
(5); (b) Time dependence of the thickness increment on the 
concentration of Hsp70 in solution. Zoomed-in section of the 
calibration curve at low concentration is given as inset in a linear 
scale. 
 
The spectral shift in Fig. 2a corresponds to adsorption (or 
binding) of different molecular layers. Due to a limited 
resolution of the original ∆ spectra, only spectra of two 
concentrations 300 ng/ml and 10µg/ml of Hsp70 are shown. 
The correction of ∆ spectra allows increasing the resolution; 
the same effect can be achieved by TIRE data fitting.  
Typical calibration curve for binding Hsp70 chaperones to 
OEP61 specific receptors is given in Fig. 2b. As one can see, 
the effective thickness of adsorbed molecular layer increases 
and reaches saturation upon binding the chaperones in low 
concentrations (up to 1 µg/ml) to respective receptors. The 
maximal values of the response, summarized in Table 1, 
depend on the type of receptors and chaperones used. It is 
clear, that OEP61 receptor binds specifically Hsp70 but does 
not bind non-complementary chaperone Hsp81. At the same 
time the receptors HOP2A and TOC64 known to be specific 
to Hsp81 demonstrate binding behavior. However at large 
concentrations of chaperones exciding 1:1 ratio, a sharp 
increase of the response is observed for all receptor-
chaperone pairs and is most likely caused by non- specific 
binding.

The study of binding kinetics using dynamic TIRE 
measurements allowed the evaluation of the association 
constant KA (see an example in Fig. 3). The values of KA 
summarized in Table 1 for different receptor-chaperone pairs 
are typically in the range of 108-109 (l/mol) which is 
characteristic for specific receptor-chaperone interaction at 
low concentrations of chaperones.

Fig. 3:  (a) Typical time dependencies of Ψ and ∆ during binding 
Hsp70 chaperone to OEP61 receptor; (b) Evaluation of the 
association constant (KA) 
 
At large concentrations of chaperones, however, much 
lower values of KA in the range of 104-106 (l/mol) were found 
confirming the earlier suggestion of non-specific interaction. 
The above quantitative analysis demonstrates a clear 
separation of specific and non-specific binding. 
  
B. Interaction of chaperones with receptors naturally 
present in chloroplast membranes 
Similar type of TIRE measurements and data analysis 
were performed for binding chaperones to OEP61 receptors 
present in natural samples of chloroplast membranes. The 
results obtained are in line with those presented in the 
previous section. Binding of Hsp70 at low concentrations 
from 1ng/ml up to 1µg/ml yields the thickness increase 
reaching saturation at the level of 0.35 to 0.47nm. At larger 
concentrations (from 5 to 500 µg/ml) however, the thickness 
increases sharply again which indicate non-specific binding 
of chaperones. The study of TIRE kinetics also revealed a 
huge difference in KA values (from 8.5.108 to 109 (l/mol) at 
low concentrations of chaperones and those in the range of 
105 to 3.105 (l/mol)  at high concentrations. Such 4 orders of 
magnitude difference gives clear separation between 
specific and non-specific binding of Hsp70 chaperons to 
OEP61 receptors in chloroplast membranes.  
It is interesting that to note that blocking OEP61 
receptors with specific antibodies diminish binding of low 
concentrations of Hsp70 chaperones to almost zero values; 
the association constant can not be calculated in this case. 
However, at high concentrations of Hsp70 chaperones non-
specific binding appeared again yielding the KA values of 
about 8.5.104 (l/mol) typical for such processes.  
Typical AFM image of a sample of chloroplast 
membrane after binding Hsp70 chaperones in Fig. 4 shows 
clearly the aggregates with the height of about 6 nm and 
horizontal dimensions of about 25 nm. At the same time, 
AFM images of bare chloroplast membranes revealed rather  
flat and mostly featureless surface with the mean roughness 
of about 0.5nm. Considering the enlargement of horizontal 
features due to a finite tip radius of 2-4 nm, these aggregates 
could correspond to chaperone molecules of on the surface 
of a sample.

C. The study of aggregation of α-synuclein in lipid 
membranes.  
Preliminary study of the surface morphology of α-
synuclein oligomers adsorbed on the surface of lipid 
membranes deposited on mica was carried out using AFM.  
Fig. 5 shows typical AFM images of a lipid layer containing 
α-synuclein. The features with the horizontal dimensions of 
20-30nm may correspond to α-synuclein aggregates or 
oligomers containing 5 to 6 monomer molecules.

synuclein oligomers on mica support: (a) pseudo-3D image; (b) 
section analysis showing horizontal and vertical dimensions of 
features along the selected line.    
 
      Since the height of these features is in the range of 2 to 3 
nm, it can be concluded that α-synuclein oligomers are 
embedded in the lipid membrane. The roughness analysis of 
AFM images confirms the above conclusions. It showed 
that the surface of mica substrates is very flat with the mean 
roughness of 0.150nm. After deposition of a lipid layer 
mean roughness has increased to 0.224 nm; the presence of 
α-synuclein oligomers has resulted in further roughness 
increase to 1.266 nm.  
      Further study of α- synuclein monomers and oligomers 
on the surface of lipids using the methods of AFM and 
TIRE is currently underway.  
 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
       The optical analytical technique of total internal 
reflection ellipsometry has found another useful application 
in the study of protein-protein interaction. The obtained 
quantified information on the thickness of adsorbed 
molecular layers and the association constant of binding 
allows detailed characterization of a novel chaperone 
receptor extracted from plants in its abilityto  bind 
specifically Hsp70 chaperone. The binding abilities of  
OEP61 receptors electrostaically adsorbed on the surface 
and those present naturally in chloroplast membranes were 
accessed and found to be similar. This confirms one more 
time that the method of electrostatic layer-by-layer 
deposition can be successfully used for immobilization of 
proteins, 
and 
elecrostatically 
immobilized 
proteins 
(chaperones this time) retain their functionality. A clear 
separation of specific and non-specific interactions of 
proteins was demonstrated in the work for the first time.  
      A complementary AFM study revealed the presence of 
proteins (chaperones) on the surface.  An important finding 
of embedding of α-synuclein oligomers into the lipid 
membrane was confirmed with AFM. Further study of the 
mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation in lipid membranes 
using methods of AFM and TIRE is currently underway. 
This work may shed light into the origin of Parkinson’s 
other neurological diseases.
