Abstract - Zoonoses are infectious diseases that are transmitted 
either directly or indirectly from animals to human beings. The 
human and economic costs of zoonoses and antimicrobial 
resistance can hardly be overestimated. Due to ecological and 
socioeconomic behavioral changes, new and different zoonoses 
emerge while antibiotics’ effectiveness decreases. Early 
warning and surveillance systems are part of the public health 
response. However, a more pre-emptive approach is needed. 
‘One 
Health’ 
entails 
a 
global 
strategy 
to 
advance 
interdisciplinary collaboration and communications in all 
aspects of health care for humans, animals and the 
environment. As of yet, the importance of social sciences and 
eHealth technologies for infectious disease research and public 
health policy is underestimated. The digital humanities provide 
methods and concepts that can set the One Health approach to 
work.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The human and the animal worlds have profound and 
multifarious interactions that lead to a wide range of 
psychological, social, medical, economical and agricultural 
benefits. However, there are some severe drawbacks as well, 
for instance, with regard to the transmission of infectious 
diseases from vertebrate animals to human beings 
(zoonoses). The pathogenic micro-organisms - such as 
bacteria, viruses, fungi or prions - we share with 
domesticated or wild animals, have caused some of the most 
significant disease outbreaks in recent years, including HIV, 
Ebola, avian influenza, Q-fever, H1N1 flu, SARS and more 
recently MERS-CoV. Over 200 zoonotic diseases, often 
species-specific, have been identified. They have a serious 
and rising impact on global public health [1], and 
accordingly, receive scientific attention [2].  
 
Outbreaks of zoonoses are typically hard to predict 
because of the complex and ever changing nature of the risk 
factors involved. At the same time, antimicrobial resistance 
is increasing and the dawn of the post-antibiotic era is a 
matter of global concern [3]. The human and economic 
costs of zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance are 
substantial. It is estimated that 60% of all human diseases 
and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases is caused by 
zoonotic pathogens over the past six decades [4]. The rate at 
which these have appeared in people has increased over the 
past 40 years, with at least 43 newly identified outbreaks 
since 2004. The immediate costs of zoonotic diseases over 
the last decade have been estimated to be more than $20 
billion, with over $200 billion indirect losses to affected 
economies as a whole [5].  
 
In the Netherlands, at least 19 people died as a 
consequence of the Q-fever outbreak (2007-2010), while the 
societal costs have been estimated between EUR 161-366 
million [6]. A decade earlier in the UK the 1996 BSE 
outbreak caused at least 174 deaths (2010) and led to 
economic costs of at least EUR 1.1-1.4 billion [6]. But, by 
far the heaviest burden from human-animal diseases is 
carried by the poorest people. In 2012, the International 
Livestock Research Institute published a review study 
analyzing some 1000 disease-surveys covering ten million 
people and six million animals [7]. The authors conclude 
that the thirteen most important zoonoses together cause 2.4 
billion cases of human illness and 2.2 million deaths each 
year, 
mostly 
in 
low- 
and 
middle-income 
nations. 
Approximately 75% of the economic and health damage 
impacts on only nineteen countries (e.g., Tanzania, India, 
Togo, Nigeria, Ethiopia) were the density of people and 
animals create ripe conditions for zoonotic diseases to arise 
and spread among populations of poor livestock keepers. In 
Asia and Africa, at least 55000 people recently died of 
rabies, according to the World Health Organization [8]. 
Expenses related to the prevention and control of rabies are 
estimated at US$ 590 million annually on both two 
continents. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
monetary losses resulting from diseases such as human and 
livestock cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) have been 
calculated at the global level - assuming substantial under-
reporting. The global human burden of echinococcosis may 
be as high as one million DALYs - or an annual loss of US$ 
764 million. A maximum annual livestock production loss is 
estimated to amount to some US$ 2.2 billion. More figures 
and estimations on the health and economic impact of 
zoonoses can be found at the WHO website on ‘neglected’ 
zoonotic diseases [8]. 
Over the last decades the industrial countries have 
succeeded to eliminate, reduce or control zoonotic diseases

through substantial investments in public health: preventive 
measures, health education, feed bans, animal vaccination 
programmes, sanitation, food controls, culling sick animals 
etc. Nonetheless, the developed world - especially the US, 
the UK and Australia - now includes the key hot spots for 
emerging zoonoses (see Fig. 1). In low resource countries, 
such investments are not yet feasible in operational, legal, 
cultural or financial terms. Zoonoses present a threat to both 
human and animal health. Because of the relationship 
between development and population health the changing 
course of zoonotic diseases has led to increased attention in 
public health policy and research.    
 
 
Figure 1. Emerging zoonotic disease events 1940-2012  
(source: International Livestock Research Institute, 2012). 
 
It is generally assumed that new and different zoonotic 
diseases will continue to develop because of  
- 
a worldwide growth of people and animals (population 
density, cattle density);  
- 
increased international (illicit) traffic of people, animals 
and products (globalization, eco-tourism); 
- 
cultural changes (urbanization, migration, war, agro-
industrial developments, farming new animal species); 
- 
ecological 
changes 
(climate, 
environment, 
biodiversity). 
 
Quite a few zoonoses are caused by RNA (Ribonucleic 
acid) viruses, which have high mutation rates and are 
extremely able to accommodate to changing circumstances. 
All this has raised global awareness among national, 
international, intergovernmental bodies and the redirection 
of resources towards prevention and control of zoonoses. 
This has led to the establishment of new, international 
expert networks, and surveillance and early warning 
systems such as the global network for animal disease 
research 
STAR-IDAZ 
(star-idaz.net), 
the 
European 
Emerging and Major Infectious Diseases of Livestock 
EMIDA (emida.era.net), the European Network for 
Diagnostics 
of 
‘Imported’ 
Viral 
Diseases 
ENIVD 
(enivd.net/) or Discontools (discontools.eu), a joint initiative 
of industry and a wide range of stakeholders and several 
others. In the following sections it is maintained that the 
‘One Health’ strategy to counter the threat of zoonoses can 
only be effective when the social sciences, the humanities 
and digital technologies are systematically taken into 
account. 
II. 
ONE HEALTH 
In the course of last century, the age-old shamanist 
wisdom that human (mental) health, animal health and 
environmental health are inextricably connected has been 
revitalized. Long before the well-known ‘father’ of 
veterinary epidemiology, the American Calvin W. Schwabe 
(1927-2006) proposed and promoted the term ‘One 
Medicine’ in his textbook "Veterinary Medicine and Human 
Health" (1984) the German ‘founder’ of social medicine 
physician Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) coined the term 
‘zoonosis’, stating that "... between animal and human 
medicine there are no dividing lines – nor should there be" 
[9]. This implies that the scientific foundations between the 
two do not really differ and that they share the same 
paradigm. Contemporary insights from human medicine, the 
natural sciences and veterinary disciplines also indicate that 
human, plant and animal systems are all part of the shared, 
planetary 
eco-system. 
Biologically 
speaking, 
both 
domesticated animals and wildlife are to be considered as 
close relatives that possess the same capacities to transfer 
infectious microorganisms. “We should therefore treat our 
relationship with other animal species as part of a 
continuum across which pathogens can emerge and spread, 
exploiting new niches as we change our interactions, and 
moving into and out of erstwhile distinct species, regions or 
communities” [10]. 
 
During the last decade, the concept of ‘One Medicine 
One Health’ evolved, urged by public concern after the 
2003 outbreaks of SARS and Ebola hemorrhagic fever. It 
strives to advance scientific breakthroughs in an integrative 
and collaborative way [11]. In 2004 a series of conferences 
followed, addressing the theme ‘One World – One Health’ 
to underscore the health links between people, wildlife and 
the environment. In 2007/2008 the American Veterinary 
Medical Association (AVMA) and the American Medical 
Association (AMA) passed similar ‘One Health’ policy 
resolutions and took joint initiatives for action and 
collaboration. This resulted among others in the One Health 
commission, in summits and partnerships, targeting “the 
establishment 
of 
closer 
professional 
interactions, 
collaborations, and educational and research opportunities 
across the health sciences professions, together with their 
related disciplines, to improve the health of people, animals, 
plants and our environment” [12].

Today, the integrative, holistic concept of ‘One Health’ 
entails 
a 
positive, 
global 
strategy 
for 
expanding 
interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all 
aspects of health care for humans, animals and the 
environment. It has been disseminated beyond the North 
Americas. “The synergism achieved will advance health 
care for the 21st century and beyond by accelerating 
biomedical research discoveries, enhancing public health 
efficacy, expeditiously expanding the scientific knowledge 
base, and improving medical education and clinical care” 
[13]. The visionary concept inspired many initiatives to 
improve 
collaboration 
between 
the 
often-segregated 
disciplines in policy, education and research. Strengthening 
the knowledge infrastructure through transdisciplinary 
cross-fertilization has become an important motivation, e.g., 
in European public health and policy projects. Since 2008, 
the EU has promoted the One Health approach, and it has 
been integrated into certain EU strategy documents [14]. 
The European Network of Excellence for Zoonoses research 
(medvetnet.org/) organizes thematic conferences on this 
subject, international One Health conferences take place 
(e.g., http://www.onehealthglobal.net/) and many others 
adopted the concept. One Health is promoted by scientists 
all over the world and supported by national organizations 
such as U.S. Centers for Disease Control or the Dutch 
National Institute for Public Health and the Environment 
(RIVM) as well as global organizations such as the United 
Nations (UN), the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World 
Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the International 
Federation for Animal Health and others. WHO, FAO and 
OIE signed a tripartite collaboration agreement to better 
coordinate their global activities at the animal-human-
ecosystem interfaces [15]. Since 2011 an international open 
access, peer-reviewed ‘One Health Journal’ Infection 
Ecology & Epidemiology is published by a Swedish group 
of scientists to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration in 
One Health [16]. In 2012 the World Bank published a report 
on cost/benefit analyses that accentuate the importance of 
the One Health approach for prevention and control of 
infectious diseases and recommended wider implementation 
[17].  
 
  In quite a short time, the concept has drawn massive 
attention and support. It is “intended to be all-inclusive 
among the scientific disciplines of human medicine, 
veterinary medicine and all other related scientific health 
disciplines” [18]. Therefore, it is remarkable that behavioral 
sciences, the humanities and technology are most seldomly 
explicitly mentioned in major documents on ‘One Health’.  
III. 
DIGITAL HUMANITIES 
‘Digital humanities’ is a recent term that evolved from an 
increasing demand to understand and study how digital 
media interact with human experience and daily life [19]. It 
denotes an interdisciplinary, academic domain of education, 
research and practice where digital methods and media are 
used to study traditional topics in language, history, art, 
philosophy, communication and cultural studies. Moreover, 
the ‘digital revolution’ enabled a range of new behaviors, 
social contexts and objects, ranging from, e.g., cyber 
bullying 
or 
virtual 
environments, 
to 
web-based 
recommendations systems or big data, that may be studied 
from the digital humanities’ perspectives. The opportunities 
of digital media for scholarship, research, education, 
presentation and cooperation also belong to this area. Like 
in any new academic field of interest, the subject of defining 
the scope remains a matter of academic debate. According 
to the UCLA Center for Digital Humanities “Digital 
Humanities interprets the cultural and social impact of new 
media and information technologies - the fundamental 
components of the new information age - as well as creates 
and applies these technologies to answer cultural, social, 
historical, 
and 
philological 
questions, 
both 
those 
traditionally conceived and those only enabled by new 
technologies” [20]. In line with this definition, we consider 
the social and behavioral sciences as belonging to the same 
academic practice and paradigm.  
 
  Evidently, the academic exchange between social 
sciences and computational sciences could benefit all 
domains of society. Rogers et al. [21] for instance develop 
methods to study the dynamics of internet censorship 
through the national web of Iran, or the workings of search 
engines, query logs and social networks. Others use 
mapping and advanced visualization techniques to study the 
role of animals in 19th American century cities [22], plot 
patterns of intellectual or creative exchange in the early-
modern world [23] or operate digital European language 
repositories [24]. In the biomedical and health sciences the 
digital humanities gave rise to concepts such as eHealth, 
Medicine 2.0 or participative healthcare that address the use 
of information and communication technologies to support 
and improve health, health care and medical research. The 
social and participative opportunities enabled by digital 
media are widely used for the benefit of many [25]. 
Researchers use the internet as a tool and a source for 
studying human social behavior.  Since 2006, for instance, 
the use of queries and social media networks have been 
studied to inform disease surveillance and early warning of 
infectious diseases [26].  
IV. 
NEW APPROACHES 
While the cooperation between the veterinary, botanical, 
entomological and human domains is now widely 
encouraged, the involvement of the humanities, i.c., the 
social and behavioral sciences is conspicuously absent. The 
ongoing concentration on the pathogen is understandable 
because of the historical effort - and successes - of the bio-
medical professions to curb infectious diseases. It has 
obviously been the most likely approach. From a 
contemporary One Health-perspective however, this focus 
173
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 5 no 3 & 4, year 2013, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

should be widened as soon as possible. We believe that the 
humanities and the social sciences could play a decisive role 
when it comes to operationalizing the high-flown ‘One 
Health’ concept on the ground. Especially since they are so 
happily and prolifically engaged with information and 
communication technologies in what is sometimes called 
‘ePublic Health’ or ‘Public Health 2.0’ [27]. At least three 
reasons illustrate why One Health should be completed with 
methods and concepts from the digital humanities and the 
social sciences. 
 
  The first is that the threat of (re)emerging zoonoses 
combined with our limited arsenal to protect public health, 
simply demand us to combine efforts. Faced with today’s 
challenges we need to better understand what people 
actually do - not just what microorganisms do. They travel 
within and between their human hosts who participate in 
complex social networks. At the end of the day, people’s 
behaviors make the difference when it comes to the 
transmission of disease-causing microorganisms. People 
create the conditions for the transmission of novel and re-
emerging zoonoses but they also build the conditions that 
reduce their incidence, and prevent suffering, illness and 
death. Epidemiological data evidently need a human context 
to be meaningfully interpreted and put to use. Without the 
social sciences, the complex interactions of factors and 
circumstances that determine novel zoonotic disease spill-
over get lost because they simply can’t be understood. 
Social behavior is an essential ingredient of R0, the basic 
reproduction number of an infectious disease. In Table I the 
social and behavioral factors associated with all three 
components of R0 are summarized, after Janes et al. [28]. 
This knowledge on the social nature of transmission 
dynamics and possible modes of transmission informs the 
design of effective public health interventions and tailored 
risk communication on zoonoses.

The 
second reason to appreciate interdisciplinary 
collaboration with the humanities and the social sciences is 
their proven effectiveness in public health practice. Travel 
vaccination campaigns, personal hygiene, sanitary control, 
‘test and slaughter’, protective clothing, changing life style 
choices (tobacco, fat, alcohol, sex, drugs), school-based 
prevention and education are just a few examples of 
effective social and behavioral measures [29]. Social 
scientific methodologies could be extended for use in the 
field of applied infectious disease research. Interesting 
examples can be found for instance in studies that model the 
impact of individual behavior on the spread of infectious 
diseases [30] or in qualitative research on the behavioral 
defenses and social psychological mechanisms through 
which people protect themselves against pathogens [31].  
 
  Thirdly, the reach and social impact of public health 
interventions, when extended and connected with the 
opportunities offered by information and communication 
technologies, is considerably enlarged as compared to 
biomedical approaches alone [32]. This is demonstrated for 
instance in the practice of the Antibiotic Stewardship 
Program of Eursafety Health-net. This cross-border 
German-Dutch collaboration to prevent and control health 
care associated infections such as MRSA1 has been very 
successful to reach a significant reduction of nosocomial 
MRSA cases [33]. The use of a web-based tools for both 
patients and professionals has been important for the 
protection of patient safety and quality of care. Information 
and communication technologies [34] potentially empower 
them to take control over their personal and professional 
lives. They support for instance adherence to medical 
guidelines and protocols for hygiene or prudent prescription 
of antibiotics, which are essential to reduce health care 
associated infections. Self-management is one of the main 
promises of Health 2.0 and other innovations in health care 
[35, 36]. This matches seamlessly with currents attempts to 
re-define health in terms of peoples’ positive capabilities to 
cope with disease and misfortune [37]. Technology supports 
this aspiration, which should be extended to the One Health 
domain. Another example is the design and development of 
an eHealth intervention to prevent tick bites and Lyme 
disease infections among green professionals and outdoor 
people currently undertaken by Beaujean et al. [38]. 
Although the incidence and prevalence of people presenting 
to the GP with tick bites or the first signs of Lyme disease 
has increased substantially, compliance to guidelines for 
prevention is generally low. A mobile app is developed to 
address the motivations of people at risk with tailored 
messages to eventually change this behavior. 
 
The incredible growth in the use, availability, accessibility 
of these digital technologies - their speed, range and impact 
- also provides us with new opportunities for disease 
monitoring, surveillance and research [39]. These allow us 
                                                           
1  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium 
resistant against most antibiotics. It belongs globally to the most frequent 
causes of  difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections in humans.

not only to inform a targeted public health response but also 
to act preemptively. Recently, scholars have called for an 
investment in fields such as digital humanities and 
computational social sciences, to using ‘big data’, the kind 
of digital information made available by improved data 
management, advanced mathematical analysis tools and 
increasing storage capacity [40]. Traditionally social or 
cultural data were collected via social scientific methods 
based on data scarcity, demands for formally controlled 
designs and financial considerations: field studies, user 
panels, focus groups, interviews, questionnaires and 
surveys. However today, the social and cultural interactions 
passing through the internet are considered as fast, valuable 
and relatively cheap sources of data for social and cultural 
research [27, 41]. This is obviously of great importance for 
the early warning, prevention and control of zoonoses. In 
fact, this new area of study with new methodological issues 
in risk communication, prevention and big data is the 
Number One challenge for sustainable and credible One 
Health solutions.  
 
What is needed to effectively integrate the digital 
humanities and the social sciences into One Health? A good 
part of this may simply be translational and relational. Like 
in art and in music, an open mind is a condition sine qua 
non for cooperation. Social scientists, natural scientists, and 
medical practitioners need to be able to confer, to 
communicate and join forces now the global momentum is 
there. We hope to co-create one such opportunity at next 
year’s 3rd international One Health Congress in the 
Netherlands [42].
