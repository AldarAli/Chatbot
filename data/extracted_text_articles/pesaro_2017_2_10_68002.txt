Abstract— A literature review conducted as part of a research 
project named “Measuring Safety in Aviation – Developing 
Metrics for Safety Management Systems” revealed several 
challenges regarding the safety metrics used in aviation. One of 
the conclusions was that there is limited empirical evidence 
about the relationship between Safety Management System 
(SMS) processes and safety outcomes. In order to explore such 
a relationship, respective data from 7 European airlines was 
analyzed to explore whether there is a monotonic relation 
between safety outcome metrics and SMS processes, operational 
activity and demographic data widely used by the industry. Few, 
diverse, and occasionally contradictory associations were found, 
indicating that (1) there is a limited value of linear thinking 
followed by the industry, i.e., “the more you do with an SMS the 
higher the safety performance”, (2) the diversity in SMS 
implementation across companies renders the sole use of output 
metrics not sufficient for assessing the impact of SMS processes 
on safety levels, and (3) only flight hours seem as a valid 
denominator in safety performance indicators. At the next 
phase of the research project, we are going to explore what 
alternative metrics can reflect SMS/safety processes and safety 
performance in a more valid manner.   
Keywords - Safety Metrics; Safety Management Systems; Safety 
Performance; Safety Outcomes.

 INTRODUCTION 
This paper presents part of an on-going 4-year research 
project “Measuring Safety in Aviation – Developing Metrics 
for Safety Management Systems” [1] executed by the 
Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and co-funded by 
the Nationaal Regieorgaan Praktijkgericht Onderzoek SIA 
[2]. A literature review we conducted in 2016 identified 
several challenges concerning the measurement of safety [3]. 
Between February and June 2016, surveys were executed to 
explore (1) what, how and why, safety metrics are used and 
(2) whether a monotonic relation between Safety Management 
System (SMS) process metrics and safety outcomes could be 
established.  
Safety outcomes are defined as accidents, (serious) 
incidents, occurrences and other safety related events [3]. 
SMS process metrics include indicators on safety staff, 
improvements, 
training, 
communication, 
hazard 
identification, risk management and emergency response [3]. 
A full listing is given in appendix 2. The SMS process metrics 
can be applied at a system level but are usually more 
informative at the sub-system (department, activity type etc.) 
level. Safety outcomes on the other hand are emergent 
indicators representative of the whole system. 
The results from the first part of the surveys were 
presented in the International Cross-industry Safety 
Conference 2016 and published in the proceedings [4], thus 
this paper focusses on the 2nd part of the surveys. The relation 
between safety related processes and outcomes can be claimed 
through two channels: empirical evidence or credible 
reasoning [5]. Since respective empirical evidence is scarce 
[6], we aimed at finding associations between SMS process 
and safety outcome metrics by using data collected from the 
partners of the project.  
In section 2, the research problem and the hypotheses are 
introduced. Section 3 describes the methodology used and the 
results are presented in section 4. In section 5, the results are 
discussed. The paper finishes with the conclusion in section 6. 
 
II. 
RESEARCH PROBLEM 
In the literature review [3], it was concluded that the 
reasoning behind the relationship between SMS processes and 
safety performance lies principally on linear safety/accident 
models, where a direct cause-effect relation between safety 
management activities and safety events is implied. Thus, the 
relationship between SMS/safety processes and outcome 
metrics is seen as monotonic in practice under a “necessary 
but not sufficient” logic; a single failure or deviation from a 
SMS/safety process might not lead to an adverse outcome, but 
multiple failures (e.g., malfunctioning barriers) or deviations 
(e.g., incompliance with procedures) are likely to cause 
unwanted outcomes. Besides the linear accident models, few 
systemic models have been introduced in literature [7][8] but 
they haven’t been extensively applied to the industry. 
The aforesaid thinking and industry practice are translated 
into two hypotheses:

H1: There are consistent and similar monotonic relations 
of SMS process data with safety outcomes across all 
companies. 
In order to judge whether there is a positive or negative 
effect of an SMS process on safety outcomes, the direction of 
the relationship, the scope and timeliness of the respective 
process must be considered. For example, in the cases of 
safety training and audits, a negative correlation is expected 
under the argument that more training or audits lead to fewer 
safety events. When considering other SMS processes, such 
as safety reporting and hazard identification, a positive 
correlation might be expected since those activities retrofit 
risk assessment with a goal to mitigate risks and improve 
safety performance; on the other hand, a negative correlation 
might also reflect that risk assessment does not succeed to 
increase safety performance, meaning to decrease adverse 
events. 
H2: There are consistent and similar monotonic relations 
(i.e., regardless their positive or negative direction) of 
demographic and operational activity data with safety 
outcomes across all companies. 
Correlations of operational activity or/and demographic 
data with safety outcomes (1) over time for each company and 
(2) across the whole sample when considering respective 
averages per company, indicate validity of the respective 
indicators used in the industry (e.g., accidents per passenger 
miles or flights). 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
Thirteen companies who participated in the project were 
asked to provide data in the form of a data-sheet. The request 
was based on the types of metrics identified through the 
literature [3] and represented in appendices 1 and 2. The data 
sheet included 5 operational activity figures (e.g., departures), 
12 demographic data fields (e.g., number of staff,), safety 
outcomes (e.g., number of occurrences of various severities) 
and 38 fields covering output and frequency of SMS activities 
(e.g., number of hazards identified, amount of SMS 
documentation updates) from up to 10 years. Specific 
instructions were not provided since the fields correspond to 
data that organizations are familiar with, but some 
clarifications were offered upon request from the partners. 
Ten companies provided the data requested within the 
time frame set. Most of the large companies reported that they 
needed considerable time and resources for retrieving the data 
from several databases since such data were not always 
directly linked to safety performance and maintained by the 
safety department. Two large companies sent their annual 
safety dashboards and the research team converted that data to 
the respective fields of the datasheet. Due to a recent 
implementation of a SMS in three out of the ten companies, 
the sheets received did not include enough data points for 
statistical analysis. Consequently, data sets from seven 
companies were used for statistical tests (Table 1).  
After the collection of data, raw figures were converted to 
ratios in order to use comparable figures across years for each 
company; this resulted in an extensive list of measures. The 
researchers tested all available pairs (i.e., Operational 
Activities – Outcomes, Demographics – Outcomes and SMS 
processes – Outcomes) as a means to examine all 
relationships. Because of the limited sample size, all data were 
tested 
with 
non-parametric 
correlations. 
Spearman’s 
coefficient was chosen to explore any monotonic relations of 
SMS/operational/demographic metrics with safety outcome 
ones. Spearman’s coefficient indicates the presence of a 
monotonic relationship and not the strength of linear 
associations. The statistical significance was set to p=0.05. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Table 2 shows the number of pairs tested for monotonic 
relations. The table is divided into three sections 
corresponding to operational activities, demographics and 
SMS processes tested for associations with safety outcomes.

Within each section, the number of valid pairs are mentioned 
and the significant correlations for those pairs of data 
[number, (percentage)].  
Appendix 3 includes a sample of cases where significant 
correlations within companies were found; the whole set of 
results were published in a technical report [9]. The cells in 
the corresponding tables include the direction of each 
correlation (i.e., POS: Positive and NEG: negative) and the 
number of companies for which the data permitted the 
conduction of valid correlations per case (i.e., sample N). The 
cells where POS or NEG are followed by a number (i.e., x 
Number) indicate how many companies had the respective 
significant correlation.  
In addition to the results within companies, Table 3 shows 
the significant correlations of the averages of safety outcomes 
of all severities with activity (e.g., departures) and 
demographic data (e.g., full time equivalent of company 
staff,). Tests for miles flown were not feasible due to limited 
data. Through those correlations, we explored the validity of 
using 
demographic 
or 
operational 
activity 
data 
as 
denominators of ratios of adverse safety events, since such 
ratios are used by the industry to measure safety performance.  
The findings presented in Table 3 showed that: 
• 
Increased flight hours’ activity is associated with 
more occurrences, serious incidents and safety events in 
general. 
• 
The more FTEs are spent by contractors, meaning 
the more the outsourcing of company activities, the fewer the 
incidents recorded by the company. 
• 
The more the flight hours’ load per pilot, the more 
the occurrences and events in general. 
Taking into account that the flight hours was the main 
variable associated with some types of safety outcomes, we 
conducted further statistical tests as follows (table 4): 
• 
Mann – Whitney test was used as a means to explore 
if the ratios of each event type by flight hours differ between 
large companies and SMEs. The calculations did not show 
significant differences. 
• 
Kolmogorov - Smirnov tests were conducted for the 
ratios of each event type by flight hours for SMEs; the sample 
size did not allow the conduction of those tests for large 
companies. The results showed significant differences 
between SMEs regarding accidents and incidents per flight 
hours. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
According to the results, the following observations can be 
made: 
1. 
The significant correlations regard only part of the 
SMS processes and safety outcomes and a small portion of the 
sample, and the distribution of associations is highly scattered. 
No strong evidence was found that the output and frequency 
of all SMS processes had an effect on safety outcomes; 
significant associations were found only for few of the 
participant companies. 
2. 
The results suggest that just the operation of an SMS 
does not guarantee an effect on safety outcomes; therefore, 
that other factors, such as the quality of SMS processes, might 
play an important role. Also, an evaluation of the effectiveness 
of an SMS against high severity events seems unjustified in 
the frame of this survey. More specifically: 
a. 
Most of the significant correlations were found for 
occurrences (i.e., the lowest severity category of safety 
events) as well as all safety outcomes regardless their severity. 
b. 
Accidents, serious incidents and incidents and their 
ratios by activity and demographic figures were associated 
with a very few SMS processes. 
c. 
Only at a few companies the outputs and frequency 
of SMS processes had a visible effect on low severity events, 
the latter reflecting safety performance at shorter intervals. 
3. 
There were 33 negative and 124 positive correlations 
between SMS process and safety outcomes. However, in 59 
cases of all correlations the data regard a single company that 
provided respective data, so the results cannot be deemed as 
representative of the whole sample. Nevertheless: 
a. 
The negative correlations sporadically regarded 
numbers or ratios related to staffing of the safety department, 
internal audits, safety training, safety surveys and hazard 
identification. Although due to the limited sample those 
associations cannot be generalized, the aforementioned areas 
of SMS processes were influential on safety outcomes of low 
severity mostly for a single company. It is noticed that a 
negative correlation between SMS processes and safety 
outcomes can be considered as a positive case only when 
outcomes decrease over time; in case that, under a negative

correlation, events increase over time, the SMS can be 
contemplated as insufficient. 
b. 
Most of the positive correlations were found for the 
safety reporting and risk assessment processes, the 
interpretation of those associations being dependable on the 
timeliness of those processes. The SMS activities are 
performed continuously, so a distinction between a “positive 
reactiveness” (e.g., more risk assessments occur due to more 
outcomes) and “negative proactiveness” (e.g., more risk 
assessments lead to an increase of adverse events) is not 
directly evident. Contextual information is of paramount 
importance in order to interpret such results correctly.  
Observation No 1 suggest that hypotheses H1 is partially 
rejected due to the limitations imposed by the sample size. 
Additionally, the diverse ways that SMS processes are 
implemented across the industry and over time, and the 
different interpretations of outcome thresholds [9] might have 
affected the results and the validity of comparisons within and 
amongst companies. 
A. Correlations between operational activities and safety 
outcomes 
The results presented in Appendix 3 do not suggest a 
consistent picture within companies. Some activity data 
related to departures, miles flown and flight hours were 
associated with all safety events, incidents and serious 
incidents, but in the majority of the cases those findings 
regarded only one company out of the whole sample. Only in 
seven cases the associations of flight hours related data with 
some types of safety outcomes were found for two companies. 
Interestingly, accidents were not represented in the significant 
correlations with operational activities, although annual 
reports published by regional and international bodies use 
rates of accidents as a means to depict safety performance 
(e.g., [10]); perhaps, the large sample that such reports include 
might render the use of accident ratios meaningful, but the 
results of our survey showed that those ratios might not be 
representative of safety performance at the company level. 
The latter is also supported by the fact that we did not observe 
any association between operational activity data and number 
of accidents when considering averages across the sample 
(Table 3). 
Furthermore, in the case of flight hours, the correlations 
with outcomes were found interchangeably positive or 
negative depending on the denominator and the company, 
whereas in few cases the same correlation was found negative 
for one company and positive for another. This observation 
might once more reflect the dissimilarities in the interpretation 
of safety outcome definitions, or/and the differences regarding 
the effectiveness of safety management in those companies; a 
positive correlation between activity and outcome data 
indicates that safety management is not improving (i.e., as 
safety management activities increase, safety outcomes 
increase too and vice versa), whereas a negative correlation 
signals that safety management performs either as expected 
(i.e., when outcomes decrease over time) or poorly (i.e., when 
outcomes increase over time). 
Monotonic relations were found across the companies 
regarding flight hours and flight hours per pilot with safety 
outcomes, the accidents excluded, thus suggesting that the 
specific type of operational activity might be a more valid 
exposure measurement than departures and miles flown. By 
nature, departures do not reflect the total load imposed to 
company staff (e.g., time that pilots fly or maintenance 
requirements based on the hours that aircraft operate), and 
miles flown are not also directly related to the total load due 
to a variety of factors such as aircraft capabilities, flight plans 
and fuel efficiency policies (e.g., the same distance might be 
covered in shorter or longer time based on the air traffic and 
average flying speed). The findings of our study are aligned 
with [11], who showed a relation of task load expressed in 
total flight hours per employee with rates of events attributed 
to human error. 
B. Correlations between demographics and safety 
outcomes 
The picture is even more distorted regarding the 
relationship between demographic figures and safety 
outcomes. The correlations found were highly dependable on 
the denominators used in the safety outcomes; for example, 
the average aircraft age was positively correlated with number 
of occurrences and the ratio of occurrences by flight hours, but 
negatively correlated with the ratios of occurrences by miles 
flown and departures. Hence, under the expectation that the 
higher the age of the aircraft, the more the occurrences under 
increasingly complex operations, it seems that, in this case 
too, flight hours can act as a more representative denominator 
compared to miles flown and departures.  
Furthermore, the number of company employees was 
positively correlated with occurrences, but negatively 
associated with incidents and all safety events regardless 
severity. Although those differences do not refer to the same 
company, they suggest that the use of raw demographic data 
alone cannot render respective indicators valid. In conjunction 
with the discussion of the results of the paragraph above, 
ratios of activity figures, and especially flight hours, by 
demographic data can be more valid representations of risk 
exposure in comparison with net numbers of operational 
activities or demographics. 
Taking into account the overall picture and the limitation 
imposed by the sample size, the researchers claim that the 
hypothesis H2 is partially rejected. As in the discussion of the 
hypothesis H1, the different interpretations of outcome 
thresholds might have affected the results. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
From the numerical analysis of the data sample, consistent 
correlations 
between 
operational 
activity 
figures, 
demographic data, SMS process data and safety outcomes 
could not be established. The correlations in the sample 
demonstrated a wide variety, and there were no correlations 
supported by all usable datasets. Only part of the datasets 
resulted to significant correlations for specific combinations 
of data, and in some cases, there were both positive and 
negative correlations for the same pair of variables in the 
sample. 
Due to the limited sample size (i.e., number of 
participating companies and data points per company), we do

not claim external validity of the results and we could not fully 
reject the research hypotheses. However, since the latter 
cannot be fully confirmed, the current practices in safety 
performance measurement seem of limited validity. The 
partial rejection of hypotheses H1 and H2 is aligned with, and 
indirectly validated by, the concerns of the companies about 
the existing safety metrics and their needs for better / 
alternative ones [9]. Nevertheless, the diverse and, 
occasionally, contradictory findings from the quantitative 
analysis might be attributed to the (1) different interpretations 
of thresholds of safety outcomes, (2) implementation of SMS 
processes in various ways, due to which the data points of this 
study reflected different contexts of the companies and 
changes over time, and (3) limited value of the linear approach 
to safety, as suggested by the models widely used by the 
industry and the emergent behavior at the system level that 
constitutes safety. This latter consideration is exuberated by 
the mismatch of indicators at the sub-system (department, 
activity process) and system level. 
In overall, the findings of this study indicate the need to 
move towards the development of metrics that will be more 
representative of SMS processes and safety outcomes and will 
allow valid comparisons over time and across the industry. 
Based on the results of this research phase, the justification of 
the overall project does not only stem from a need to improve 
scientific knowledge on the topic of aviation safety metrics, 
but it is also jointly supported by the concerns and needs of 
the industry and the findings of the analysis of numerical data 
collected in this research phase.
