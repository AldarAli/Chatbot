INTRODUCTION
In recent years, passive radar systems where GPS
satellites are used as transmitters have become increasingly
popular as an alternative to traditional radar systems. The
GPS Forward Scatter Radar (GPS FSR) is a specific case of
FSR, where GPS satellites are exploited as ‘transmitters of
opportunity’. In [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5], the authors consider
the possibility of detecting air targets in bistatic and forward
scatter radar, which exploit GPS satellites as transmitters. A
possible algorithm for air target detection using GPS L5-
based FSR system is described in [6], and the detection
probability characteristics are analytically calculated in [7]
for low-flying and poorly maneuverable air targets in the
urban interference environment. In [6] and [7], the authors
have discussed the potential to increase the Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) to detect aircrafts with GPS L5-based FSR
system.
Papers [5], [6], [7] and [8] are devoted to experimental
measurements made by using the GPS L1-based FSR system
and the Software-Defined GPS receiver, developed by the
Aerospace Department at the University of Colorado [9],
allowing to observe the geometric shadows (signal blocking)
of ground objects of different sizes, mobile and stationary.
Our hypothesis was that, since there is a very weak signal
on the surface of the Earth from a GPS L1-based FSR
system, in order to register the radio shadow of some object,
the object size must be large, and the distance from the
receiver to the object must be small.
The purpose of our experiments was to clarify the real
possibilities of the proposed system for recording radio
shadows created by different objects - depending on the
object’s size, distance from the receiver to objects, speed of
objects, and satellite constellation at the time of recording.
Our GPS L1-based FSR system contained a Universal Serial
Bus USB-based recording system with a small commercial
GPS antenna, which recorded the GPS data flow and stored
it as binary files in our computer, and a Software-Defined
GPS receiver to process the recorded data in MATLAB [9].
The Software-Defined GPS receiver contains the Acquisition
block to identify satellites, and the Code & Carrier Tracking
block to form the navigation message. Next, the obtained
navigation
message
was
integrated
within
hundreds
milliseconds in order to form the radio shadow of the object
and the integrated message was used for further detection of
the
object
based
on
its
radio
shadow.
During
the
experiments, the choice of satellites to observe the deepest
shadow from the object, the estimation of the type and
parameters of radio shadows, were all carried out manually
by the operator; they were not automated.
The purpose of this article is to explore different types of
GPS shadows created by aircrafts of different sizes and
shapes.
This
knowledge
is
necessary
to
extract
the
characteristic parameters of the radio shadows, which can be
used for the further classification of different types of
aircrafts.
The originality of the research is that we propose to use
additional information derived from radio shadows of
different aircrafts in order to improve the detection of low-
flying aircrafts. The innovation is to develop new secondary
applications of GPS technology.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes the principle of the diffraction in forward scattering
radar system. The algorithm for signal processing is
presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the experimental
scenario and the experimental results. Finally, Section 5
draws conclusions based on the obtained results.

DIFFRACTION IN FORWARD SCATTERING RADAR
The forward scattering radar technology exploits the
phenomenon of diffraction of electromagnetic waves in order
to detect targets. The diffraction is observed when the
wavelength of electromagnetic waves, incident on the target,
is much less than the size of the target.
If the distance from the receiver to the target (Rt) is
comparable to the size of the object (D), then the target
creates the “geometric shadow” of electromagnetic waves
incident on the target. In the zone of “geometric shadow”,
act the laws of geometrical optics, i.e., electromagnetic
waves spread straightforward. In that zone, the distance from
the transmitter to the target meets the inequality R << D2/λ 
where λ is the wavelength. In the near diffraction zone, i.e., 
Fresnel zone, the diffracted electromagnetic waves mutually
interfere, and the approximate inequality R ≤ D2/λ holds for 
the distance between the receiver and the target. In the far
zone of diffraction, i.e. Fraunhofer zone, the distances from
the transmitter to the target and from the target to the
receiver are much larger than the size of the target. In this
area, the inequality R >> D2/λ holds. The diffraction of light 
passed through the circular aperture is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1.
Diffraction of light passed through the circular aperture (1–
zone of geometric shadow; 2 to 5 – Fresnel zone; 6, 7 –Fraunhofer zone)
The diffraction of light on the disc is shown in Figure 2.
According to the Babinet’s principle, the diffracted signal in
this case only changes the sign compared to the diffracted
signal passed through the circular aperture.
Figure 2.
Diffraction of light on the disc (1, 2 – zone of geometric
shadow; 3 to 7 – Fresnel zone; 8 to 11 – Fraunhofer zone)
The FSR technology actively exploits the diffraction of
the transmitted electromagnetic waves in the far zone of
Fraunhofer when the target moves near the baseline “receiver
– transmitter” and far from the receiver. In that case, the
Forward Scatter (FS) effect is observed, the most attractive
feature of which is the drastic increase in the forward
scattering radar cross-section, and, therefore, the strong
increase of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the received
signal.
This paper considers the case when a target fully blocks
the signal from the GPS satellite (geometric shadow), Figure
3. This way, the formed GPS radio shadow can be used for
target detection, estimation and classification.

SIGNAL PROCESSING
The use of GPS signals as a passive radar system is
becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to radar
systems. The general block-scheme for target radio shadow
detection using a Software-Defined GPS receiver [3] is
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4.
Block-scheme of signal processing
According to Figure 4, in the software-defined GPS
receiver, the message is obtained in result of execution of a
set of program files for acquisition and tracking, presented in
[5]. The message is further inverted as follows:

             (1) 
where Ip is the component at the output of the Code &
Carrier tracking block, x is the absolute value of Ip, y is the
inverted signal x.
The SNR of the signal y is further improved by filtering
using the Jumping Average Filter. The Neyman–Pearson
algorithm for signal detection can be used for testing a

alternative H0 (target is absent):

where yf’(l) is the filtered signal within the reference window
of size L needed for power noise estimation. The scale factor
Tfa is determined in accordance with the probability of false
alarm Pfa, which should be maintained by the detection
algorithm.
The registered GPS radio shadows are characterized by
the following parameters:
1)
The length of a target shadow, obtained by the FS
GPS system can be approximately related to the physical
size of the object. The length of the target shadow (dT) in
seconds is estimated as:

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this experimental study, the GPS L1-based recording
system (1575.42 GHz) consists of two types of GPS
receivers and a GNS 5490 ADS-B receiver for verification of
measurements (Figure 5). The first GPS receiver (Antaris
AEK-4R) is used to determine the location of the satellites
over the horizon, while the other software GPS recording
system (GNSS_SDR) is used to record and store GPS signals
from different targets.
Figure 5.
Experimental equipment
The GPS receiver GNSS_SDR
was
proposed
and
developed in the Aerospace Department of the Colorado
University, USA [9]. This recording system receives and
records the GPS data flow using a small commercial GPS
antenna and an USB-based device. The recorded GPS signals
are saved as binary files in the computer memory. The
position of the satellites at the time of the experiment
obtained from the GPS receiver “Antaris AEK-4R” is shown
in Figure 6.
In our experiment, only signals from visible satellites that
are located close to the line “target-receiver” at high
elevation angles, are recorded for further processing. The air
target crosses the baseline “satellite-receiver” and forms GPS
geometric shadow, (falling of the received signal) which is
observed as a deep “hole” in the received signal.
Figure 6.
Satellite constellation during the experiment
The two recording systems use the same GPS antennas
mounted on the roof of a car, which was stopped 900 meters
from the start of the runway of the Sofia airport (Figure 7).
During the experiment, the length of the airplanes is about
30-40 m and the distance from the airplane to the receiver is
about 80 m.
Figure 7.
Receiver scenarios
During the experiment, airplanes that take off from the
west fly over the GPS receiver. The visible satellites shown
in Figure 6 are: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 16, 23, and 30. The filtered
signals from all visible satellites are shown in Figure 8. It can
be seen that the signal from satellite 7 was blocked by the
airplane.
As shown on Figure 8, the deepest “hole” in the signal
strength is created by the airplane in case of the satellite 7.
The
detection sensitivity
depends
on
the
satellite
position. The detection probability is a function of the signal-
to-noise ratio. In our case, the highest signal to noise ratio is

achieved when the air target is located near the baseline
“satellite-receiver”, which means that the bistatic angle is
close to 180 degrees.
Assessing the shadow parameters of two types of aircraft,
it was found that the parameters were very sensitive to the
geometry of the experiment. The position of the satellite is
very important. The biggest shadow comes from the
satellites located 90 degrees above the horizon. When using
the same GPS satellites for detecting an aircraft, it was found
that the distance from the airplane to the receiver strong
influenced over the GPS shadow.
After the preliminary analysis of data, the filtered data
has been statistically processed in order to calculate the
statistical
parameters
of
all
shadow
parameters.
The
mathematical expectation and the standard deviation of all
measured parameters have been calculated for each aircraft
(Table 1). The goal of this statistical processing is to check
the
possibility
of
using
the
resulting
parameters
for
classification of targets by means of a statistical approach.
Figure 8.
Filtered signals from all visible satellites
The duration of the target shadow (dT) in seconds is
estimated as the difference between the beginning and the
end of the target shadow in the time domain. The peak
signal-to-noise
ratio
(SNRpeak)
is
estimated
as
the
difference between the average noise power in dB and the
minimal value of the GPS shadow in dB.

Embraer ERJ-175. The geometry of the scenarios was
constant in all experiments for correct comparison of the
obtained results. All experiments were conducted when the
airplanes were taking off, the flying speed was about 300
km/h and the distance from the airplane to the receiver was
about 80 m.

CONCLUSION
The purpose of the article was to demonstrate the ability
to automatically detect of low-flying aircrafts by Forward
Scattering GPS system. The other goal of this article was to
study and estimate different types of GPS shadows created
by aircrafts of different sizes and shapes. The recordings
were made both with commercial and with non-professional
equipment. The topology of the experiments was the same
as that used in the FSR systems. The statistical processing
of the resulting estimates of GPS shadow parameters shows
that the selected aircrafts create GPS radio shadows with
different parameters. From the results, it is evident that we
can apply a statistical approach for the classification of
aircrafts from their radio shadows. The quality of the
classification depends on the size and shape of targets.
The proposed approach and results can be used in
various systems for security and surveillance facilities. In
addition, the proposed technology can be used to create a
passive GPS radar network for detection of air targets based
on their GPS radio shadows. The advantage of the proposed
GPS FSR system is that it is cheap and costs less than $
1,000. It is also a passive system using signals from
available GPS satellites that cover the entire globe with a
signal. Thus, the proposed FSR system can be used around
the world.
