Abstract—This paper proposes an access control scheme for
multimedia content consisting of several media such as text,
images, sound, and so on. The proposed scheme simultaneously
controls access to each medium of multimedia content in which
a hierarchy based on the quality (resolution, frame rate, bit
rate, and so on) is allowed to be in one medium. The proposed
scheme derives keys through hash chains, and each medium/
entity is encrypted with each individual key. By introducing
modiﬁed hash chains, the proposed scheme manages only a
single key for multimedia content, and it delivers only a single
key to a user for the content regardless of which parts in the
content the user can access; whereas the conventional access
control schemes having the above mentioned features manage
and/or deliver multiple keys. The single managed key is not
delivered to any user. Furthermore the proposed scheme is
resilient to collusion attacks. Performance analysis shows the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is
more secure and simpler than the conventional scheme in terms
of key management and delivery.
Keywords-multimedia communication; access control; key
derivation; hash chain; cryptography.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the growth in network technology, the exchange
of digital images and sound as well as text become very
common regardless of whether the digital content is used
for commercial purpose or not. Since such digital content
is easily duplicated and re-distributed, protecting copyrights
and privacy is an important issue. Access control based
on naïve encryption (encrypting the whole content) [1] or
media-aware encryption [2]–[6] has been studied widely to
protect digital content.
A simple and straightforward way for realizing versatile
access control to multimedia content consisting of several
media to which several entities belong is encrypting each
entity individually. This approach, however, has to manage
a large number of keys, according to the number of entities
in multimedia content. Moreover, a user has to receive a
number of keys, according to the number of accessible
entities.
On the other hand, for JPEG 2000 [7] coded images and/
or MPEG-4 ﬁne granularity scalability [8] coded videos,
scalable access control schemes have been proposed [2]–[6].
These schemes utilize one- or multi-dimensionally hierarchi-
cal scalability provided by coding technologies so that a user
can obtain an image or a video in the permitted quality from
one common codestream. In addition, hash chain [9], [10]
is introduced to several schemes for reducing the managed
and managed keys [3]–[6].
Though a hash chain-based access control scheme has
been proposed for multimedia content [11], the number of
managed keys increases dependently on not only the number
of media but also the dimensions of hierarchies in the media.
The number of delivered keys is increased as many as the
number of managed keys. Moreover, malicious users can
share their keys to increase accessible media/entities in this
scheme.
This paper proposes an access control scheme for multi-
media content which the scheme manages and delivers only
a single key. The proposed scheme assumes that content
consists of several media and there is a scalable hierarchy on
the quality in one of media. By introducing modiﬁed hash
chains, the managed key is one as many as the delivered
key regardless of which media/entities the user is allowed
to access. The managed key is not delivered to any user
in terms of security against key leakage. Moreover, the
proposed scheme is resilient to collusion attacks which
malicious users access much more portions beyond their
rights illegally.
This paper consists of ﬁve sections. Section II mentions
the conventional access control scheme for multimedia and
describes the problems of the conventional scheme. The
new scheme is proposed in Section III and is analyzed in
Section IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.
II. CONVENTIONAL ACCESS CONTROL SCHEME FOR
MULTIMEDIA CONTENT
This section brieﬂy describes the conventional access
control scheme for multimedia content [11], and summarizes
problems of the conventional scheme to clarify the aim of
this work.

An example of multimedia content (the number of media M =
2, the number of entities in the ﬁrst medium D1 = 4, and the number of
entities in the second medium D2 = 3).
A. Conventional Scheme
The conventional scheme [11] assumes that content con-
sists of M different media (image, video, sound, text, and so
on) which a hierarchy (image/video resolution, frame rate,
bit rate, etc) exists in each medium; In the text medium, the
appearing order of paragraphs has its own meaning, and it
is referred to as a semantic hierarchy. The scheme uses a
symmetric encryption technique.
For multimedia content consisting of M different media,
this scheme manages M keys. Fig. 1 shows an example of
multimedia content where M = 2. For the m-th medium
where m = 1, 2, . . . , M, encryption keys are derived from
managed key KDm
m
that corresponds to the m-th medium,
where Dm represents the number of entities in the medium,
i.e., the depth of the hierarchy. Encryption keys Kdm
m ’s are
derived through a hash chain as
Kdm
m = HDm−dm (
KDm
m
)
, dm = 0, 1, . . . , Dm − 1,
(1)
where Hα(β) represents that cryptographic one-way hash
function H(·) is applied to β recursively α times. The
dm-th entity in the m-th medium is encrypted with its
corresponding encryption key, Kdm
m .
A user receives M decryption keys. Each user receives
different set of decryption keys, which are delivered keys,
due to which media/entities the user is allowed to access, but
all users receives the common encrypted multimedia content.
From the delivered keys, the user derives keys for accessible
entities in accessible media through the same hash chain as
used in the encryption key derivation. That is,
Kδm
m = H∆m−δm (
K∆m
m
)
, δm = 1, 2, . . . , ∆m − 1,
(2)
where K∆m
m
is the delivered key for the m-th medium. By
using ∆m decryption keys, the user decrypts ∆m entities
from the ﬁrst entity to the ∆m-th entity.
A user who receives K0
m cannot access any entities in the
m-th medium, because one-way property of H(·) prevents
the user to generate any other valid keys for the m-th
medium of the content. The conventional scheme introduced
this unusable key concept in order to cope with medium-
based access control.
B. Problems of the Conventional Scheme
The conventional scheme [11] has two major problems.
• the number of managed and delivered keys
• collusion attack-vulnerable
As mentioned in the previous section, the conventional
scheme encrypts entities in a medium independently of other
media. This feature of the conventional scheme requires
managed and delivered keys as many as media in the
multimedia content, i.e., M keys are managed and M keys
are delivered to a user for content consisting of M different
media. This conventional scheme employs ordinary hash
chains [9] rather than cross-way hash trees [10] in essentials.
The latter problem is also attributed to the feature just
described in the above paragraph. Though introducing un-
usable key concept in order to serve medium-based access
control, the conventional scheme allows malicious users to
collude to access inaccessible media. A user who can display
images and another user who is allowed to read texts share
their keys and obtain both images and text paragraphs.
In the next section, a new access control scheme for mul-
timedia content is proposed. The proposed scheme manages
only a single key and delivers also only a single key to
a user regardless of which media/entities in the content the
user can access. In addition, the proposed scheme is resistant
to collusion attack.
III. PROPOSED SCHEME
This section proposes a new access control scheme for
multimedia content. The proposed scheme assumes that
multimedia content C consists of M media and the ﬁrst
medium has a hierarchical structure;
C =
{
G1
1, G1
2, . . . , G1
m, . . . , G1
M
}
,
(3)
G1
1 ⊃ G2
1 ⊃ G3
1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ GDm
1
,
(4)
where G1
m (m = 1, 2, . . . , M) represents the m-th medium
content itself, and D1 is the depth of the hierarchy in the
ﬁrst medium. The complementary sets represent entities in
medium G1
1 as
Edm
1
= Gdm
1
− Gdm+1
1
,
dm = 1, 2, . . . , Dm − 1,
(5)
and
EDm
m
= GDm
m .
(6)
The proposed scheme derives keys from single managed key
KC and encrypts content C by encrypting Edm
m ’s using those
corresponding keys. In addition, this scheme delivers only a
single key to each user.
Fig. 2 shows an example conceptual diagram of the
assumed multimedia content, where content C consists of

A. Key Derivation and Encryption
This section provides the key derivation mechanism in the
proposed scheme under the condition content C is abstracted
as Fig. 2. For easy understanding, more practical example
is given in Fig. 3. Content C in Fig. 3 consists of video,
sound, and text, i.e., M = 3, and video has a hierarchy with
four in depth in terms of the frame rate, i.e., D1 = 4. In this
example, G1
1 is digital video, and it is playable in several
frame rates; 120, 60, 30, and 15 frames per second (fps).
Shown in Fig. 4, frames decoded at each rate are represented
by G1
1, G2
1, G3
1, and G4
1, respectively. Media G1
2 and G1
3 are
sound and text, respectively.
In the example here, access control is provided based on
not only media but also the frame rates of video. For content
C shown in Fig. 3, keys for encryption are derived as shown
in Fig. 5, and each key is used to encrypt and decrypt
the corresponding medium/entity. For the video, KE1
1 is

Firstly in the proposed scheme, keys KEd1
1
are derived
from KC as
KEd1
1
= Hd1 (KC) ,
d1 = 1, 2, . . . , D1,
(8)
where H(·) is a cryptographic one-way hash function.
Eq. (8) represents an ordinary hash chain [9], and the chain
is shown with solid arrows in Fig. 5.
Meanwhile, keys KE1
2 and KE1
3 are derived by modiﬁed
hash chains in the proposed scheme. In this example, these
keys are given as
KE1
2 = H
(
f
(
KE4
1, H
(
KE4
1
)))
,
(9)
KE1
3 = H
(
f
(
KE2
1, H
(
KE2
1
)))
,
(10)
respectively, where f(·) is an function with two input and
one output in which the length of inputs and output are iden-
tical. A bitwise exclusive or operation is a simple example of
function f(·). As shown in Eqs. (9) and (10) which represent
modiﬁed hash chains introduced in this paper, keys given by
Eq. (8) are repeatedly used to derive other hash chains that
are different from the ordinary hash chains. The modiﬁed
hash chains are shown with combination of solid and dashed
arrows in Fig. 5.
Each entity Edm
m
is encrypted using each corresponding
key KEdm
m , and encrypted content C is opened to public.
B. Delivered Key for Each User and Decryption
1) User allowed to access video, sound, and text: A user
permitted to decode frames at 120 or 60 fps receives KE1
1
or KE2
1 shown in Figs. 6 (a) and (b). Eq. (8) is same as,
KEd1
1
= H
(
KEd1−1
1
)
,
d1 = 1, 2, . . . , D1.
(11)
The user can obtain KEd1
1
(d1 = 1, 2, 3, 4) using an ordinary
hash chain in Eq. (11).
As shown in Fig. 5, keys KE1
2 and KE1
3 for sound E1
2
and text E1
3 are generated from KE4
1 and KE2
1, respectively,
using modiﬁed hash chains in Eqs. (9) and (10). Thus the
user can also obtain KE1
2 and KE1
3 and play sound and read
text in addition to watch the video.
2) User allowed to access video and sound: A user can
access frames decoded at 30 or 15 fps receives KE3
1 or KE4
1
as shown in Figs. 6 (c) and (d). The user has KE4
1 but does
not have KE2
1. Thus the user can obtain only KE1
2 for sound
E1
2 by Eq. (9) and play sound as well as the video.
3) User allowed to access sound: A user allowed to
access only sound E1
2 receives KE1
2 as shown in Fig. 6 (e).
KE1
2 is a key generated by Eq. (9). Any keys cannot be
generated from KE1
2.
4) User allowed to access text: A user allowed to access
only text E1
3 receives KE1
3 as shown in Fig. 6 (f). KE1
3 is a
key generated by Eq. (10). KE1
3 can generate no other key.

C. Features
Two main features of the proposed scheme are brieﬂy
summarized here.
By introducing modiﬁed hash chains, the proposed
scheme reduces both the managed and delivered keys to
one. In contrast, the conventional scheme [11] manages and
delivers keys as many as media.
By using modiﬁed hash chains, multiple media are related
to prevent malicious users to collude. The conventional
scheme is collusion attack-vulnerable, because the conven-
tional scheme encrypts each medium separately.
In addition to the above features, the single managed key
is not delivered to any users in the proposed scheme while
the conventional scheme delivered the managed keys to some
users.
It is noted that any arbitrary function and key combination
can be used for a modiﬁed hash chain and that any arbitrary
key assign can be used to properly control access to the
content.
IV. EVALUATION
The proposed scheme is evaluated by comparing with
the conventional scheme [11] which uses ordinary hash
chains [9] only. Evaluation is given in terms of the number
of managed and delivered keys, delivery of managed keys,
and collusion attack resilience.
Table I shows the results of comparisons. The proposed
scheme manages and delivers only a single key regardless
of the number of media and the depth of the hierarchical
structure in a medium, whilst the conventional scheme [11]
must manage and deliver keys as many as media. The single
managed key is not delivered to any user in the proposed
scheme, whereas the managed keys are delivered to some
users in the conventional scheme [11]. In addition, the
proposed scheme is resilient to collusion attacks while the
conventional scheme [11] is naive for collusion attacks. The
table brings out the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper has proposed a new access control scheme
for multimedia content in which modiﬁed hash chains are
employed. The proposed scheme manages only a single
key. This scheme also delivers only a single key to a user
regardless of which portions of the content to which the
user can access. In the proposed scheme, the single managed

scheme prevents malicious users to collude for accessing
much more portions. Comparison result summarizes the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme
thus controls access to mulimedia content securely and
simply in comparison to the conventional scheme.

Applying the proposed scheme to content in which each
medium has its own hierarchical structure is a further work.
Moreover, we would like to apply the proposed scheme to
other security technologies such as digital watermarking and
secret sharing.
