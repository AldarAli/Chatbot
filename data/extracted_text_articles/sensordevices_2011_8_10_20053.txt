Abstract—This paper presents some experimental results 
concerning the acoustic emission (AE) of different 
material structures, submissive at mechanical tests. 
Acoustic emission signals were prevailed by AE sensor, 
fixed on the material surface by an electroacoustic 
material. The AE piezoelectric sensor realizes the 
mechanical to electrical energy conversion, and the 
output signal is displayed on the memory digital 
oscilloscope. By signal analysis in time and frequency 
one can get the attenuation coefficients, delaminating, 
voids, defects, into material, revealing important 
information about the material structure behavior at 
mechanical stresses. Also, we can determine the 
moments when the material could be cracked or 
irreversibly deteriorated. Therefore, one can detect the 
maximum acoustic emissions and predict the material 
failure. Experimental works provided information 
concerning the AE response of different type of 
materials (aluminum, brass and concrete) under 
mechanical strengths, in order to predict their behavior 
at maximum strengths. The information could be 
applied for complex construction structures, in order to 
prevent their breaking risks.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A critical issue in practical structural strength state 
monitoring is related to the capability of proper sensing 
systems integrated within the host structures to detect, 
identify, and localize damage generation, such as cracks and 
potential problem areas in metal pressure boundary 
applications while other types of Nondestructive techniques 
are used to provide acceptance or rejection criteria [1]. To 
this aim, many techniques have been proposed involving 
dynamic measurements such as: modal analysis, acoustic 
emission, and ultrasonics [2]. 
Acoustic Emission techniques have been used in the 
field for the testing of metal and composite pressure vessels 
and piping. Nondestructive techniques were not accepted 
long time for the testing of bridges, and other components 
of the infrastructure because of two primary reasons: the 
difficulty in separating valid signals from extraneous noise 
and the inability of the AE technique to determine the size 
of the crack [1]. 
It results in the need for the development of advanced 
and effective inspection techniques. Thus, AE techniques 
draw a great attention to diagnostic applications and in 
material testing.  
Acoustic Emission inspection is a powerful aid to 
materials testing and the study of deformation, fracture and 
corrosion. It gives an immediate indication of the response 
and behavior of materials under stress, intimately connected 
with strength, damage, fracture and failure [3]. 
Acoustic emissions (AEs) are the stress waves produced 
by the sudden internal stress redistribution of the materials 
caused by the changes in the internal structure. Possible 
causes of the internal-structure changes are crack initiation 
and growth, crack opening and closure, dislocation 
movement, 
twinning, 
and 
phase 
transformation 
in 
monolithic materials and fiber breakage and fiber-matrix 
debonding in composites. Most of the sources of AEs are 
damage-related, the detection of these emissions are 
commonly used to predict material failure. The Acoustic 
Emission method can be successfully applied for monitor 
the integrity of piping systems, and to aid in maintenance 
planning. 
AE technology involves the use of ultrasonic transducers 
(20 kHz - 1 MHz) to listen for the sounds of failure 
occurring in materials and structures. Crack growth due to 
fatigue, hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion, and creep 
can be detected and located by the use of AE technology. In 
addition high pressure leaks can also be detected and 
located. AE technology is also finding wide application in 
the nondestructive testing for structural integrity of 
composite materials and structures made from composite 
materials. 
Fiber 
breakage, 
matrix 
cracking, 
and 
delaminating are three mechanisms that can produce AE 
signals when stress is applied to the material or structure. 
AE sensors typically consist of a piezoelectric element 
on a ceramic plate inside a metal case with an electrical 
contact on top, insulated by epoxy. The shape, dimensions 
and mass of most commercial AE sensors make them 
unsuitable for integration into composites. In spite of 
extensive work with thin PVDF films (e.g. [4], [5], and [6]) 
there are to the best of our knowledge no commercial PVDF 
AE sensors available. AFCs present a number of advantages

in comparison with conventional AE sensors: (1) light 
weight, (2) flexibility (adaptable to curved surfaces), (3) 
anisotropic sensitivity, and (4) potential for integration into 
composites due to their low thickness (about 300 µm) and 
compatibility with polymer-matrix laminate and related 
manufacturing processes. Ultrasound wave propagation in 
materials is presented in [7]. 
II. 
USUAL AE APPLIED TECHNIQUES 
Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques have been studied in 
civil engineering for a long time. The techniques are 
recently going to be more and more applied to practical 
applications and to be standardized in the codes. This is 
because the increase of aging structures and disastrous 
damages due to recent earthquakes urgently demand for 
maintenance and retrofit of civil structures in service for 
example. 
Crack initiation can be determined by the appearance of 
the AE signal at low stretch stress levels. After the crack 
advent, the AE signals around the zero stress were thought 
to be caused by crack-face grinding when the cracks were 
closed. 
2.1 Wireless Monitoring Techniques Based on MEMS 
Existing monitoring systems use traditional wired sensor 
technologies and several other devices that are time 
consuming to install and relatively expensive (compared to 
the value of the structure). Typically they are using a large 
number of sensors (i. e. more than ten) which are connected 
through long cables and will therefore be installed only on a 
few structures. A wireless monitoring system with MEMS 
(Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems) could reduce these 
costs significantly [8]. MEMS are small integrated devices 
or systems combining electrical and mechanical components 
that could be produced. The principle of such a system is 
shown in the scheme given in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1. Scheme for wireless sensing of structures using radio frequency 
transmission techniques and MEMS [8]. 
2.2 Motes 
Monitoring systems equipped with MEMS sensors and 
wireless communication can reduce the costs to a small 
percentage of conventional monitoring systems, and will 
increase its field of application. For instance, due to the 
detailed information of the structural behavior of bridges 
obtained from the monitoring system, maintenance costs 
could also be reduced, since inspection methods can be 
applied more efficiently [9].

processing board [9]. 
III. 
AE SIGNALS DURING TENSILE TESTING 
Acoustic-emission activities have been shown to relate 
to different stages of tensile tests of materials Figure 1 
presents the cumulative AE count, AE count rate, and stress 
versus strain relationship during a tensile test [10]. The 
cumulative AE count is the sum of the count of all AE 
events. The AE count rate is the time derivative of the AE 
cumulative count. The beginning portion of the linear elastic 
region is very quiet (i.e., low count rates and cumulative 
counts) or is associated with an incubation stage. The AE 
activity reaches its peak in the second stage right before 
yielding occurs. After the material yields, the AE activity 
decreases, but is still detectable until the material fails.  
3D-Localization of acoustic emission events is a 
powerful tool in quantitative AE techniques. It is the basis 
of advanced signal interpretation and the discrimination 
between signal and noise. Signal-based procedures, such as: 
accurate 3D localization of damage sources, solutions for 
fault plane orientation, and moment tensor inversion, are 
described with respect to applications in civil engineering. 
More quantitative analysis of the signals is based on a 3D 
localization of AE sources (hypocenters) and the recordings 
obtained from a sensor network. For instance, using moment 
tensor inversion methods, the radiation pattern of acoustic 
emission sources and the seismic moment (as an equivalent 
to the emitted energy), as well as the type (Mode I, Mode II, 
and mixed modes) and orientation of the cracks, can be 
determined [11]. 
Fatigue tests are usually long-term experiments. A great 
amount of signals, including the noises from the load-chain, 
are detected by the sensitive AE sensors during fatigue 
testing. According to the time sequence for the guard and 
main sensors to receive the signals, the signals originating 
from outside the test section can be detected and discarded. 
Crack initiation was determined by the first appearance of 
the AE signal at low stress levels. This stage has a steady-
state dislocation motion that will eventually result in 
microvoids and initiate microcracks. The third stage is an 
AE-active stage. In this stage, cracks start to grow and 
propagate. Many of the AE signals in the third stage can 
come from the crack-tip plastic deformation, fracture of 
hard inclusions, microcrack coalescence, transgranular 
cleavage, and fracture along grain boundaries.

THEORY 
The acoustic emission (AE) signal can be divided into 
successive type signal and sporadic type signal. This type of 
AE signals are analyzed through the signal processor in the 
form of variables such as the existence of a signal 
generation or the shape of signal etc. excepting the signal of 
special case. Therefore, in the signal processor, the critical 
voltage is set up for the signal processing, and the acoustic 
emission would be regarded to be generated if it exceeds the 
critical voltage. 
As shown in Figure 4, the displacement of one point x in 
the external domain by the surface traction or the body force 
(volume stress) at the micro area is expressed as follows 
using the Green function [12].

Crack initiation was determined by the appearance of the 
AE signal at low stretch stress levels. After the crack 
initiated, the AE signals around the zero stress were thought 
to be caused by crack-face grinding when the cracks were 
closed. 
Further, the AE signals cached by the sensor could be 
stocked on the digital memory oscilloscope and then 
analyzed in time and frequency, in order to determine the 
relevant material structure characteristics, such as: the 
attenuation coefficients, delaminating, voids, defects, etc.  
Also, by signal graphic representation analysis in time 
and frequency can be determined the attenuation coefficient 
of the pulse into material. In the literature we can find 
specific tables with experimental material parameter values 
for different type of metallic samples and structures. 
By studding the AE signals, one can detect the acoustic 
emissions and predict the material failure. Each material 
type, structure and geometry has particular AE impress. As 
result, specific base data could be made and applied for 
complex structures, and architectures such as: metallic 
beams, crossbeam, bridges, buildings, etc. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
By these experimental works one can determine 
practical information concerning the AE response of 
different type of materials (aluminum, brass and concrete) at 
mechanical strength and predict their behavior and 
maximum strengths.  
The AE signals prevailed by the sensor in the breaking 
moment of samples at the maximum stretch, could offer 
important data, in order to detect the AE emissions, predict 
the material failure and cracks initiation into material.  
In the future research it is provided to realize a large data 
base, concerning the various materials samples behavior at 
mechanical stretches and their AE signals analysis (shape, 
amplitude, frequency, bandwidth, etc.). So, it can obtain 
practical information about AE of monitories complex 
construction structures, such as: bridges, containers fulfilled 
with liquids, etc., in order to prevent the possible risks and 
catastrophes, their breaking due to hostile environmental 
(shocks, long time vibrations, bending, temperature 
differences, etc.).
