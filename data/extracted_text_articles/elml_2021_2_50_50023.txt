Towards a Media Semantic Taxonomy for Art Educational Implementation
Abstract—In the present work, DesignAR, a prototype of 
Augmented Reality based designing application is presented as 
a tool for art educational implementation. In addition, a 
taxonomy for Augmented Reality-related media art analysis is 
outlined, tracing semantical dimensions with a specific focus on 
the role(s) of the user when engaging with the artwork. To 
exemplify both DesignAR as well as the taxonomy as introduced, 
Human Cell, Pixel kernel is presented, inviting the user to 
reimagine the relationship of the individual within digital 
transformation. Both application DesignAR and taxonomy are 
to be employed in future art educational contexts e.g., teacher 
training or secondary art education. 
 
      Keywords-AR-Designing; Art Education; Prototyping; Media 
Art; Taxonomy. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Augmented Reality designing tools offer diverse 
opportunities in the field of art education with emerging 
concepts for classroom implementation [1]. With current 
artistic practice as part of the Black Lives Matter movement 
e.g., Breonna’s Garden [2], inviting for participatory 
cocreation, AR art is addressing core societal challenges. 
When it comes to introducing Media Art with the means of 
Augmented Reality, didactical positions are still pioneering 
[3].  
When considering classroom implementation, data 
protection and usability for teachers and students both alike 
are vital, with prototyping evolving ideally in iterative 
development 
cycles 
[4]. 
DesignAR 
was 
developed 
accordingly in iterative cycles with art teachers’ feedback 
following the principles of Grounded Theory Methodology. 
In this context, DesignAR is offering a variety of drawing 
options and designing features to be employed in art 
education. Along with the taxonomy for media art analysis, 
results are vital as didactical material to introduce art 
educators and students to Augmented Reality in artistic 
practice. 
In the following, we are looking at artistic positions and 
related work in the field of art education. Next, DesignAR is 
presented as application for augmented designing. A 
taxonomy is presented to introduce and analyze AR-related 
artwork. Finally, the artwork Human Cell, Pixel Kernel is 
presented exemplifying ways of creating via DesignAR in the 
complexity of spatial creating and meaning-formation. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The term Augmented Reality Art (AR Art) is defined as 
“artwork exhibited in a real-world environment using AR 
technology” [5] subdividing artwork in pre-AR and post-AR 
as interactive and low-cost form of artwork [5]. In terms of art 
theory and semantics, there are a few positions suggesting 
taxonomies classifying via AR Art analysis [6] or evolving 
rather in proximity to media semantics [7][8]. Also, AR-
related artwork is analyzed in relation to the internet cultural 
phenomena of interconnectedness [9]. A few positions 
address AR as similar to a choreographer-cocreator 
relationship as overlay for dance [10] drawing on media art 
philosophy e.g., AR-perception as reciprocal aesthetic 
transaction [11]. 
In terms of prototyping, pioneering concepts of 
Augmented Reality Designing were either mimicking 
traditional forms of painting [12] or exploring unique 
interfaces, even with the creator’s breath as part of Augmented 
Designing [13]. As pioneers of AR art, the artist collective 
ManifestAR is to be mentioned laying foundations of public 
interventions of AR artwork. Here, early forms of co-creative 
AR-supported designing settings were evolving [14]. 
Artistic positions blending artistic practice with art theory 
are vital as predecessors, similarly combining AR-based 
designing tools with concepts of media art e.g., Jess 
Herrington [15]. Artie Vierkant is to be mentioned, exploring 
the borders of image and object via AR both artistically as 
well as via art theory (Image Object, 2018) [16][17]. 
Social AR forms of Augmented Reality creation and 
sharing are increasingly prominent, also as platform for artists 
e.g., with Lens Studio (Snapchat) [19], inviting to feed into 
platforms with easy-accessible ways of AR-filter-creating. 
Next to social media-related applications, there is a number of

AR designing applications currently available such as graffiti-
style PaintAR [19] or Adobe Aereo [20] and AR Makr [21]. 
Now, when it comes to art educational conceptualization 
and evaluation of AR drawing, there are a variety of positions, 
ranging from paper-based augmented drawing for primary and 
secondary school [22] to gamification and AR overlay [23]. 
Media Art classes in the field of AR in higher education are 
relevant to the prevailing work, for blending AR artwork and 
didactical conceptualization at university level [18][25]. 
III. 
DESIGNAR 
In this section, the architecture of DesignAR is outlined 
along with a taxonomy for AR-related artwork. 
 
A. Prototyping 
 
DesignAR was developed in iterative cycles. The initial 
prototype was part of an art historical city guide as prototype 
dedicated to redesigning an existing memorial with basic 
features, (e.g., adding text/coloring existing shapes and adding 
2D images) as participatory elements in a guided city tour on 
the Revolution of Bavaria (1918/1919) [26][27]. 
For the next developing steps, DesignAR was designed 
with the aim of implementing features for a wider creative 
choice in virtual designing as follows. In a study with art 
teachers (N 20) and artists (N6), media cultural framings and 
didactical employment were analyzed [28]. The results 
obtained through Visual/Grounded Theory analysis hint to 
cultural effects of media in the acceptance of technology. 
Some were riding the line of engagement and distancing while 
others were either affirmative or skeptically biased in their 
decision-making and conceptualizing towards classroom 
implementation. Eventually, a variety of potential projects and 
methods for art education were put together, from the 
interpretation of 2D paintings in 3D to architectural redesign 
or poster presentation in 3D [28]. 
 
B. Architecture 
DesignAR 
employs 
Google 
ARcore 
[23], 
with 
simultaneous location and mapping technology, relying on 
the mobile devices’ sensors e.g., RGB camera and 
accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. It is is based 
on Unity/C# with elements defined as Game Objects [24].  
 
 
Figure 1. DesignAR UI 
Features of DesignAR: 
1. Color Picker/RGB/Transparency/Dark/Bright. 
2. Drawing tool: related to device position and drawing on 
surface.  
3. Brush styles: oil color/text marker/curls. 
4. Inserting Objects: cube/sphere/cylinder/text editor. 
4.1. Texture for objects: wood/plaster/gold/silver/transparent 
5. 2D-Picture Stamp tool, access to picture gallery of device  
5.1. Group objects and navigate in groups. 
5.2. Ungroup objects. 
6. UI mode vs. camera mode. 
 
DesignAR is currently available for Android, planning to be 
released for android and ios as next step.

C. Taxonomy 
 
In the following, a taxonomy to introduce AR-related 
artwork is presented. It is understood as a taxonomy for a first 
introduction to AR art, with future positions of AR-related art 
to be blending as variations further on. It is also understood as 
a media semantical classification based on the analysis of AR-
related artwork and art theory (c.f. related work). The model 
is extending existing concepts of AR-based taxonomies 
[5][9], now with a closer look at the roles of the user when 
engaging with AR-related artwork. After all, multiple 
dimensions e.g., tactile or audio-augments also are to be

considered, with respect to blind users as inclusive forms of 
AR-related artwork. 
 
TABLE I. TAXONOMY OF AR-RELATED ARTWORK 
 
 
  
Figure 4. Taxonomy embracing User, Content, and Space, and relations as 
ARt meaning formation 
Besides architecture of AR-related artwork, it is 
vital how meaning is conveyed into interrelation:                 
User-Content relation: Which role is assigned to users? Are 
users rather observers or creators e.g., AR-drawing filter 
Drawing with Jelly, Jess Herrington (2018) [31]. Are they 
embodying in hybrid filter artwork (e.g., Internet Dream, Jess 
Herrington 2019) [32]? Are users also choreographers, i.e., 
with performance and dance to be augmenting via AR (Soi 
moi, n+n corsino, 2009) [33]. Is there a combination of roles 
e.g., creator/observer? After all, is there user consent or an 
intervention without awareness of participants (EIO: Coin 
Chase, 
Mat 
Rappoport 
2012) 
[34]?                      
Content-Space relation: How does content as augmented 
information relate to space? Is there a reconstructive to 
transformative take on actual spaces? It may be not relating 
to a specific site, but rather to the user (e.g., Internet Dream, 
Jess 
Herrington) 
[32].                      
User-Space-relation: How do users relate to the site within 
the Artwork? Here, navigational features or shifts of 
perspectives are examples as explored in artistic practice 
(Craig Freeman/William Tilson: Imagining Place, 2008) 
[35]. 
                                                                                 
D. DesignAR: Human Cell, Pixel Kernel 
 
In Human Cell, Pixel Kernel (Figure 5), virtual 
representations of cells are floating around the user. Via 
DesignAR, a selection of cells is offered to stamp in the 
individual’s surroundings. Viewers also may add other AR 
objects as inspired by the theme. Human Cell, Pixel kernel 
employs the metaphor of a petri dish where the individual 
viewer is attributed to be floating amidst other “participants”, 
eventually blending the roles of observer, creator, and 
(imaginatory) embodiment. In Human Cell, Pixel Kernel, 
questions of autonomy are addressed: “Are we passive or 
active amidst digital transformation?”.

IV. 
CONCLUSION / FUTURE WORK 
 
 We presented an AR-based designing prototype along with 
a taxonomy of AR-related artwork at the intersection of user, 
space, and content. With respect to art educational 
employment, the taxonomy could be introduced encouraging 
to look for individual examples. With respect to prevailing 
studies on media culture relating to technology acceptance 
[28], it would be interesting to look at art educators’ 
encounters of Media Art also inviting to reflect upon media 
cultural self-awareness. 
Also, re-evaluating DesignAR for an inclusive educational 
practice is considered as viable for a novel research focus. For 
instance, how are affordances of deaf vs. hearing students with 
respect to AR designing tools e.g., focus of attention when

using in public space? It is vital to pursue further research to 
foster inclusive and safe criteria of AR based applications. 
The next steps for app design improvement are potentially 
the programming for iOS besides android as it is in the current 
state. Additional features such as inserting individual 3D 
objects in motion with co-creative interfaces would be fruitful 
considering classroom implementation as peer-to-peer or 
teacher-peer interfaces. Here, gaining insight in qualities of 
augmented imagination in the sense of re-imagining space via 
DesignAR would be interesting.
