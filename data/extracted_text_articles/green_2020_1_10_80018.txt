Abstract—End-of-Life Vehicles’ (ELV) recovery and 
recycling is encouraged not only due to the targets set in the 
Directive on ELV, but also due to economic and 
environmental benefits. Automotive remanufacturing serves 
as a specific circular marketing system of recovered parts’ 
reuse that can bring economic benefit both for dismantling 
companies and consumers. Moreover, in terms of greenhouse 
gas emissions, reuse of the recovered parts or the secondary 
resources 
from 
ELV 
may 
save 
CO2 
emissions 
in 
manufacturing new cars or their parts. For this reason, four 
passenger cars with different engine types were analysed in 
order to reveal the economic and environmental benefits that 
ELV dismantling and reuse of the recovered vehicle parts 
may bring to dismantlers and passenger car owners. The 
results showed that the greatest economic benefit is that 41% 
of ELV-hybrid car mass can be sold in parts that would save 
up to 3,835 Eur as an economic benefit for the dismantlers 
and 17,153 Eur for the consumers. In addition, 35% of ELV-
electric car mass can be sold in parts for reuse and it can 
bring 8,812 Eur for the dismantling company. Meanwhile, 
consumers would save up to 6,614 Eur when buying used 
parts for their car repair. Besides, an ELV-petrol car and an 
ELV-diesel car can be sold in parts 27% and 25%, 
respectively, and make economic benefits accordingly. In 
terms of global warming, treatment of ELV parts can save 
CO2 emissions caused by metal extraction. As a result, a 
secondary resource recovery can save 23–44% CO2-eq 
needed for the primary metal extraction.

I. INTRODUCTION 
According to the Circular economy principles, through 
the reuse, remanufacturing and refurbishing, the global 
economy is increasing [1]. Automotive recycling is 
playing a significant role in environmental and economic 
sectors as more and more End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs) are 
generated worldwide. In 2019, there were 1,520,159 
registered passenger cars in the Lithuanian market [2]. It 
means that more than every second Lithuanian resident 
owns a car. Due to the economic growth and faster living 
pace, the number of registered passenger cars is increasing 
every year, as well as that of ELVs. The use of secondary 
resources, promotion of ELV recycling technologies and 
the increasing use of recovered and recycled materials 
provide a promising outlook in order to gain economic and 
environmental advantages.  
There were 210,114 ELVs generated in Lithuania in 
2018 [2]. The Directive 2000/53/EC on ELV states: “No 
later than 1 January 2015, for all ELV, the reuse and 
recovery shall be increased to a minimum of 95 % by an 
average weight per vehicle and year. Within the same time 
limit, the reuse and recycling shall be increased to a 
minimum of 85 % by an average weight per vehicle and 
year” [3]. According to the data of Environmental 
Protection Agency of Lithuania, in 2018 the ELV reuse 
and recovery rate reached 95.4%, and the reuse and 
recycling rate – 92.4%.  
Automotive dismantling plays a big role in a vehicle’s 
life cycle. While consumers are choosing either to buy a 
used part or a new one, the prices are making a significant 
impact on their decision making. In this study, practical 
research was performed in order to reveal how much it 
costs to buy all the necessary parts from dismantling 
companies. Furthermore, the prices of the used parts from 
dismantlers were compared with the prices of the new 
parts placed on the market. The difference showed an 
economical benefit that consumers may have.  
The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the 
economic and environmental benefits of the treatment and 
bringing materials back to the market (upcycling) of a 
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), a Hybrid Electric Vehicle 
(HEV) and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs). 
This research is novel firstly because it provides a 
comprehensive, comparative analysis of the end-of-life 
passenger cars with four different engine types. Secondly, 
it applies directly to the Lithuanian conditions; and thirdly, 
the analysis adds a comparison of Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA) results focusing on the end-of-life phase of BEV, 
HEV and ICEVs powered with diesel and petrol.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section I provides 
the relevance and issues of the study, ELVs recycling and 
recovery goals, as well as, the situation in Lithuania. 
Section II introduces the methodology of economic and 
environmental assessment, inventory analysis, the scope 
and methods of the research. Section III presents the 
results of the economic and environmental analysis of 
selected passengers cars’ treatment. Section IV concludes 
and summarises the paper. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
In the study, the four passenger cars with different 
engine types were analysed in accordance with the most 
popular models registered in the Lithuanian road vehicle 
fleet. It was also taken into account that the average age of 
the car is 16 years. Besides, this number is very close to 
the global average – 15.8 years [4]. The analysed models 
were 2005–2008 Volkswagen Golf plus with 1.4 petrol 
engine, 2005–2008 Volkswagen Golf A5 plus with 1.9 
diesel engine, 2011–2013 Nissan Leaf with 24 kWh 
battery and 2003–2009 Toyota Prius 5 door hatchback 
with hybrid 1,5 petrol engine and 16 kW battery. For the 
detailed information about each passenger car parts, their 
weight 
and 
composition, 
International 
Dismantling 
Information System was used [5].

Five local dismantling companies were interviewed 
about each part demand on the market. The prices were 
checked and compared in e-shops. The economic benefit 
for dismantlers was evaluated by calculating the prices of 
the used parts, waste management costs and the value of 
secondary materials. Labour force and equipment prices 
were not evaluated and included in the analysis.  
For the environmental analysis of selected passenger 
cars, a methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was 
used. According to Hauschild et al. [6], LCA is an 
effective tool that can be used in the ﬁeld of (electric) 
mobility in order to answer the questions regarding 
comparisons between different types of vehicles, as well 
as, to analyse the disposal scenarios, mainly regarding the 
treatment of the main components, especially batteries, 
electric motors and car body.  
The LCA study of BEV, HEV and ICEVs powered 
with diesel and petrol was carried out following the 
procedure and recommendations indicated in the European 
standards series – ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 [7][8]. The 
goal of this LCA study is to evaluate the environmental 
impacts throughout the electric, hybrid and conventional 
vehicles’ production and end-of-life stages. The end-of-
life stage involves dismantling, recovery and recycling 
activities. The ReCiPe method at the midpoint level was 
used and the indicator of global warming as one of the 
most significant impact categories was selected, expressed 
in kg CO2-eq [9]. For the life cycle impact assessment and 
interpretation, database Ecoinvent 3.5 and software 
SimaPro 9.1 were used. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The result revealed that most vehicle parts can be 
reused for the same purpose in HEV – Toyota Prius 
(42%), while the least number of reusable parts was 
determined in VW Golf powered with diesel (25%). The 
economic benefit for dismantlers for each vehicle differs 
from 2,412 Eur (VW Golf powered with petrol) up to 
8,812 Eur, the most valuable parts are in Nissan Leaf, the 
least valuable parts are in VW Golf with petrol engine. 
The biggest savings belong to Toyota Prius users (17,154 
Eur) and the least difference between the new and used 
parts belongs to Nissan Leaf users (6,615 Eur). Toyota 
Prius owners feel much more motivated to look for 
alternatives instead of buying a new part than Nissan Leaf 
owners.  
According to the surveyed dismantling companies, not 
many electric cars – Nissan Leaf – are becoming ELVs, 
because this model is newer than 16 years, still convenient 
to use, except when an accident occurs. This explains why 
the price difference between the new and used parts of 
Nissan Leaf is not considerable. The summarised results of 
economic benefits for vehicle dismantlers and consumers 
are presented in Table I.

For the environmental impact evaluation, the main 
vehicle parts, such as the glider, the internal combustion 
engine/powertrain, Li-ion (from BEV) and Ni-metal (from 
HEV) batteries were analysed. According to Eurostat 
statistics, automotive batteries are recycled up to 80% 
[10]. The glider and engine / powertrain are made mostly 
from metal, which can be melted and used for the same 
purpose an infinite amount of times. In this study, it was 
assumed that the glider and internal combustion engine / 
powertrain are recycled 100% and batteries – 80%, which 
means that the recovered amounts of materials can be used 
in production and save CO2 emissions.  
The results of LCA (Table II) showed that the end-of-
life stage (treatment) of the glider, the internal combustion 
engine/powertrain, Li-ion (from BEV) and Ni-metal (from 
HEV) batteries account for only 10% of the environmental 
impact of the production of all these car parts. For 
example, treatment of the glider (secondary resource 
recovery) can save about 37% of CO2-eq from the glider 
production needed for primary resource extraction of 
reinforcing steel, chromium steel and copper. Furthermore, 
the internal combustion engine treatment can save about 
44% of CO2-eq from the internal combustion engine 
production needed for primary resource extraction of 
aluminium, steel, reinforcing steel, platinum, lead and 
copper. Besides, treatment of powertrain can save about 
23% of CO2-eq from powertrain production needed for 
primary resource extraction of aluminium, steel, chromium 
steel and copper. Finally, Ni-metal battery treatment can 
save about 24% of CO2-eq from Ni-metal battery 
production needed for primary resource extraction of 
nickel, cobalt and zinc.

IV. CONCLUSION 
The results showed the economic benefits for 
dismantling 
companies 
and 
passenger 
car 
owners/consumers. Around 42% of ELV-hybrid car mass 
can be sold in parts that would save up to 3,835 Eur as an 
economic benefit for the dismantlers and 17,153 Eur for 
the consumers. Besides, 35% of ELV-electric car mass can 
be sold in parts for reuse and it can bring 8,812 Eur for the 
dismantling company, while the consumers would save up 
to 6,614 Eur when buying used parts for their car repair. 
Next, an ELV-petrol car and ELV-diesel car can be sold in 
parts 27% and 25%, respectively. An ELV-petrol car can 
bring 2,412 Eur economic benefit for the dismantlers and  
 
10,127 Eur for the consumers, while an ELV-diesel car 
can bring 2,644 Eur economic benefit for the dismantlers 
and 13,915 Eur for the consumers. 
When performing the LCA analysis, there were too 
few separate car parts in the database to select. Only three 
options of 
the 
automotive 
parts (glider, internal 
combustion engine/powertrain and batteries) could be 
chosen. The LCA results in terms of global warming 
showed that treatment of ELV parts can save CO2 
emissions caused by metal extraction needed for the 
production of the analysed vehicle parts. As a result, 
secondary resource recovery can save 23–44% CO2-eq 
needed for the primary metal extraction.
