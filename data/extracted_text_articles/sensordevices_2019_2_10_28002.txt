Abstract — In the present study, we have investigated the time 
and temperature dependence of the transition of as-cast 
metastable 
Fe-(9-33at.%)Ga 
‘Galfenol’

the 
equilibrium state along with corresponding changes in their 
functional properties and anelastic effects that accompany 
these transitions. To characterize such a Time-Temperature 
Transformation (TTT) diagram, we used both long-time 
isochronal annealing (up to 300hrs) and instant heating 
treatments with different temperature protocols. In-situ

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Fe-Ga bulk poly- and single crystals, foils and nanowires 
found various applications with the main emphasis on their 
enhanced magnetostriction properties. Several important 
questions about the structure and properties of Fe-Ga alloys 
remain open: e.g., Joulian vs. non-Joulian magnetostriction 
[1], the origin of different short range ordered clusters and 
their contribution to properties [2], pseudoelasticity [3], 
anomalous temperature dependence of Young's modulus [4], 
damping capacity and anelasticity of phase transitions [5], 
etc. 
The equilibrium phase diagram does not reflect the real 
structure of Fe-Ga alloys neither in the as-cast state nor after 
annealing followed by air or furnace cooling [6]. The 
metastable phase diagram, proposed by Ikeda et al. in 2002 
[7], is too general and it corresponds only to the chosen 
regimes of cooling of Fe-Ga alloys. Functional properties of 
the Fe-Ga alloys are extremely sensitive to particular details 
of the phase transition from the metastable (as-cast, as-
quenched, air-cooled) state with A2 or short and long range 
D03 ordered structures with positive magnetostriction to the 
equilibrium 
state 
with 
L12 
structure 
and 
negative 
magnetostriction [8][9]. 
The aim of this paper is twofold: it is not only to study 
both the structure and sequence of phase transitions in 
metastable Fe-Ga alloys, but also to examine the rates of the 
transitions using different techniques, including both in situ 
tests with different heating rates and long-term isothermal 
annealing treatments. Those characteristics are of high 
interest and importance in order to design specific 
microstructures with desired properties. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 
II, we describe the experimental procedure; the results are 
presented in Section III. Finally, we conclude in Section IV. 
 
II. 
EXPERIMENTS 
The Fe-Ga alloys were produced by induction melting 
followed by casting in an Indutherm MC-20 V mini furnace 
under protective high-purity argon gas. The chemical 
composition of the produced ingots was analysed by Energy 
Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The tolerance (±0.1) 
comes from the calibration by measuring standard samples 
with a purity of 99.9999% of element. The standard error of 
measurement of the chemical composition is 0.1-0.2% wt. In 
this paper, we use only atomic %.  
Neutron Diffraction (ND) patterns were measured with a 
High-Resolution Fourier Diffractometer (HRFD) operating 
at the fast pulsed reactor IBR-2 which, is a powerful neutron 
source at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research Dubna, Russia 
(JINR). The HRFD can be switched between high-resolution 
(Δd/d ≈ 0.0015) and high-intensity (Δd/d ≈ 0.015) diffraction 
modes, both of which are needed for a joint analysis of the 
changes in the atomic structure and microstructure of the 
material upon heating or cooling. A detailed description of 
the method is given in [10], where a comparative analysis of 
the results obtained on as-cast and powder samples of the Fe-
27Ga alloy was carried out. Most of the in situ experiments 
were carried out with heating and cooling rates of 2 °C/min. 
Some tests were also carried out with cooling rates of 1, 4, 8 
°C/min, respectively.  
XRD analysis of the crystallographic structure of the 
samples was performed with a Bruker D8 Advanced 
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation.  The room temperature 
XRD tests and selected SEM-EBSD tests we used after 300 
hrs annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, namely: 
300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 575°C, respectively.

Internal Friction (IF), or the loss factor Q-1, were 
obtained from forced vibrations by measuring the phase lag 
tanφ between the applied cyclic stress and the resulting 
strain: σ = σ0 cos(ωt) and ε = ε0 cos(ωt+φ), correspondingly. 
ω = 2πf and φ is the phase lag or the loss angle. The 
temperature-dependent measurements were conducted as a 
function of temperature between 0 and 600 °C using forced 
bending single cantilever vibrations with ε0 = 7×10-5 with 
heating and cooling rates of 2 °C/min. 
DSC experiments using a Labsys Setaram system with 
heating rates of 5, 10 and 20 °C/min in air atmosphere 
allowed us to carry out the sample’s thermal analysis.  
The dilatometry tests were recorded at temperatures 
ranging from 20 °C to 800 °C at the heating rate of 5 °C/min 
using a Dilatometer Linseis L75.  
Magnetization (VSM) curves were obtained using a 
VSM-130 vibrating sample magnetometer with a heating rate 
of 6 °C/min under a magnetic field of ≈400 kA/m.  
SEM-EBSD microstructures of the alloys were identified 
by SEM operating at 20kV using a TESCAN VEGA LMH 
microscope with a LaB6 cathode and an energy dispersive 
X-ray microanalysis system (Oxford Instruments, Software 
Advanced AZtecEnergy). Both backscattered electron and 
secondary electron imaging were used in the analysis. EBSD 
analysis of the alloys was investigated using the 
NordlysMax2 detector (Oxford Instruments, Software 
Advanced AZtecEnergy) with a Crystal Structure Database 
supplied by Oxford Instruments. The Mean Angular 
Deviation (MAD) of 0.25 was used in the analysis. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
To characterize a TTT diagram, which is isothermal 
transformation diagram we used long-time isochronal 
annealing (up to 300 hrs), instant heating and instant cooling 
treatments with different cooling rates from 1 to 2500 
°C/min. 
A. As-cast alloy structures at room temperature 
According to their structure, the as-cast samples can be 
divided into four groups: 
1. x < 20, 
 
А2 structure, 
2. 20 < x < 27, 
А2 as a matrix with D03 clusters 
embedded into the matrix (existence of small amount of B2 
clusters is also not excluded), 
3. 27 < x < 31, 
D03 and B2 structures. 
4. x > 31, 
 
B2 or D03 plus a phase with 
unresolved structure. 
Within the second group, there are two subgroups:  
2a. 21 < x < 23, 
lattice parameter and width of 
fundamental peaks decrease, 
2b. 23 < x ≤ 27, 
lattice 
parameter 
increases 
linearly while the intensity of superstructure peak (111) 
increases, reaches maximum, and decreases. 
The lattice parameter is more sensitive to the beginning 
of the ordering process than the peak intensities. Up to x ≈ 
27, the ordered clusters occupy a relatively small volume as 
compared to the volume of a disordered matrix. 
B. Phase transitions at heating of as-cast alloys 
Second order phase transition in Fe-19Ga type alloys  
Ordering in Fe-19Ga type alloys is studied and confirmed 
for different regimes of heat treatment of the samples [11]. 
Transmission electron microscopy study suggests that 
ordering results in formation of small D03 type ordered 
clusters. 
In situ neutron diffraction study confirms disordering of 
Fe-19Ga structure at heating above 400°C and ordering at 
slow cooling. By means of internal friction and vibrating 
sample magnetometry measurements, which have high 
sensitivity 
to 
atomic 
disordering 
and 
change 
in 
magnetization, ordering temperature (TO) was determined to 
be 500-550°C at heating and 525-485°C at cooling. It looks 
like that doping with Tb enhances this effect, but more 
careful study is needed in future, as both Tb and Ga 
concentrations influence on the temperature ordering-
disordering reaction and degree of ordering. 
First order phase transition in Fe-27Ga type alloys  
Using the in situ neutron scattering technique (Fig. 1), we 
have defined ranges of phase transitions in the bulk samples 
of Fe-Ga alloys with 25 to 28 %Ga under constant heating 
with the rate 1 and 2 K/min [12][13]. We underline different 
rates of lattice parameters a(D03) and a(L12) increases in the 
temperature range of their co-existing, which lead to an 
anelastic behaviour of the alloy in this temperature range. 
Using a combination of neutron scattering technique with 
heat flow, magnetization, and internal friction tests analyses, 
we proved that a transient internal friction PTr peak 
accompanies the D03 to L12 phase transition during heating 
in a wide range of Ga concentrations [14].

C. Phase transitions at isothermal annealing 
Isothermal annealing of Fe–(27-28)Ga alloys at 400 to 
470 ºС leads to the D03 → L12 phase transition. The analysis 
of the intensities of the fundamental and superstructure 
diffraction peaks over time in in situ regime reveals that the 
transition between the ordered structures D03 and L12 occurs 
through the formation of the disordered state [15]. In other 
words, the sequence D03 → A2 → A1 → L12 is realized, 
where A1 and A2 are disordered fcc and bcc structures (Fig. 
2). The transition process begins with a rather abrupt 
disappearance of the ordering in the D03 phase, i.e. the 
formation of the A2 bcc structure. Then, the bcc → fcc 
transformation, apparently via a mechanism like the α → γ 
transition in pure iron, occurs, followed by the formation of 
the ordered L12 phase. An important difference in the bcc → 
fcc transition in Fe–xGa alloys at x ~ (27–28) is significantly 
lower temperature than in pure iron (Tc ≈ 911 ºC). As in pure 
iron, the diffraction patterns for these alloys show no 
evidence of tetragonal distortion, i.e. the A2 → A1 transition 
occurs in small local sample volumes in time intervals too 
short to allow observation of changes in the diffraction 
pattern.  
During disordering (D03 → A2) and ordering (A1 → 
L12) transitions, the lattice deformation is homogeneous and 
very small (ε ≤ 0.001), whereas during the first-order A2 → 
A1 transition, the linear deformations are heterogeneous and 
large: εc ≈ 0.266, εab ≈ -0.105. 
 
Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of the D03 → А2 → А1 → L12 structural 
transitions in the Fe-27Ga type alloys during isothermal annealing. D03 and 
А2 are bcc-based ordered and disordered structures. А1 and L12 are fcc-
based disordered and ordered structures. The lattice deformation is small for 
the D03 → А2 and А1 → L12 transitions and relatively large for the А2 → 
А1 transition. 
The kinetics of the whole transition process cannot be 
described within the Avrami model [16], since the value of 
the Avrami parameter n does not remain constant with the 
annealing time. However, it is possible to find out intervals 
with n(t) ≈ const. For the initial stage of the transition in Fe-
27Ga, the Avrami parameter is close to n = 2 for all 
annealing temperatures between 400 and 470°C, which 
corresponds to the model with a constant growth rate of new-
phase grains and a decreasing nucleation rate. 
D. Long-term (300°C) annealing at 300-575°C 
300 hrs annealing in vacuum of as-cast Fe-Ga samples 
was applied in order to achieve equilibrium state. Our 
experimental points are added to equilibrium phase diagram 
[17] based on Gödecke and Köster [18] studies. Each point 
illustrates the ratio between bcc phase (here we do not 
distinguish between A2 and D03 structures), fcc-derived L12 
phase, and R (Fe6Ga5) phase. These phases are shown by 
green, red and blue colours, correspondingly. Our results 
demonstrate significant deviation from the generally 
accepted diagram [17]: obviously, the boundary between the 
A2 and (A2+L12) ranges is located at lower Ga content. 
This observation is in favour of the less known phase 
diagram suggested by Bras et al. [19]. Nevertheless, both 
diagrams fail to explain experimental points close to the 
(A2+L12) and L12 boundary. We suggest that the range of 
single A2 phase is more narrow as compared with existing 
phase diagrams. Also, the results presented in Fig. 3 support 
a typical C-type of TTT diagram (Fig. 4). 300 hrs annealing 
at 575, 400, 350 and 300°C is not enough to complete 
transition to equilibrium phase, in contrast with annealing at 
500 and 450°C, which are close to the ‘nose’ of the C curve.

E. Phase transitions at cooling and critical cooling rates 
The Fe-27%Ga sample was cooled down from 900°C 
with well-controlled cooling rates from 1 to 2000 °C/min. 
Sample structures were examined to identify the first and 
second critical cooling rates. The scheme of the TTT 
diagram is shown in Fig. 4. The first critical cooling rate, 
VCr1, is defined in this paper as the cooling rate of beginning 
of the appearance of the equilibrium L12 phase out from the 
metastable D03 phase, and the second critical cooling rate, 
VCr2, is the cooling rate at which no metastable phase (A2, 
B2 or D03) is fixed in the sample structure at cooling.

27Ga alloy with two critical cooling rates of 30 and 8 K/min and indication

IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have analysed structure in the Fe-(9-
33)Ga as-cast alloys and their phase transitions in them at 
instant heating, short-term in situ isothermal and long-term 
annealing, and phase transitions after annealing in A2 range 
of phase diagram and subsequent cooling with different 
rates. Results reveal that the boundary between the A2 and 
(A2+L12) ranges is located at lower Ga content and the 
appearance of L12 depends on the cooling rate.
