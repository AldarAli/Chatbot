Abstract—In this paper, a photonic true time-delay technique
for phased-array beam steering is proposed and analyzed for
radar systems. It uses a High-Dispersion Compensation Fiber
(HDCF) and a phased array antenna, which can provide a
continuous radio-frequency squint-free beam scanning. When
the dispersion of the fabricated HDCF is as high as -1020±31
ps/nm/km, the laser wavelength can be tuned from 1549.95 to
1550.2 nm. The experimental results confirmed that the
scanning angle of far field radiation patterns for the proposed
technique can be tuned from -220 to +290 at frequencies 5.9,
12.7 and 17 GHz.

INTRODUCTION
Microwave photonics is the research of the mixing
between microwave and optical waves for applications, like
radars, communications, sensor networks, warfare systems
and instrumentation [1]. Optical beam formation for phased
array antennas has been intensely studied during the last
decade. The development of beam-forming systems with
high performance, low weight, high efficiency and low cost
is essential.
Passive optical devices, such as Photonic
Crystal Fibers (PCF) prism, coupled micro-ring resonators,
Dispersion Compensating Fibers (DCF) and PCFs, are used
in the Optical True Time-Delay (OTTD) techniques [2-5].
Many applications of fiber optics in phased array radars are
visualized. Optical control systems [6] allow the use of
desirable array functions. The most important of these is true
time-delay beam-formation, which is required for wide
instantaneous bandwidth and squint-free operation.
The use of optical TTD (True Time –Delay) to control
the radiation angle for Phased Array Antennas (PAA) allows
frequency independent beam steering, compact size and light
weight, large instantaneous bandwidth, low loss and Electro-
Magnetic Interference (EMI), which make it a promising
choice for broadband PAA [7][8]. PAA’s also allow high
directional control and rapid beam steering, without the need
for
physical
movement.
This
antenna
allows
flexible
electronic beam scanning over a wide range of angles,
without the need for mechanical rotation of the antenna, and
gives convenient spatial characteristics to the beam shaping,
by independent control of the transmitting elements.
This study proposes an optical TTD system for a 1×2-
element PAA that uses a HDCF module and a wavelength
tunable laser. The time delay and the radiation pattern for the
proposed system are verified by simulation and experimental
measurement.

THEORY AND DESIGN
A.
Antenna Design
The patch antenna design of microstrip transmission line
(W and L) has length of approximately one-half wavelength
of the center frequency resonant. The geometry of the 1×2-
element array antenna and its size is shown in Fig. 1.
All of the designs are simulated using the software
package
Ansoft
High
Frequency
Structure
Simulator
(HFSS), based on a three-dimensional finite element method
(3-D FEM). The substrates are a FR4 printed circuit board
(PCB) and a RT/duroid 6010 with dielectric constant of 4.4
and 10.2 and height of 1.6 and 0.635 mm, respectively. The
length of the single patch antenna is 0.5 λg. The distance
between the antenna and the antenna is 0.7 λeff. The λeff is the
effective wavelength, calculated by assuming effective
dielectric constant for the substrate of εeff = (εr+1)/2 [9].
From Fig. 1, it is seen that the sizes of the array antenna are,
W1 = 13.61, 4.43 and 3.2 mm, W2 = 2.97, 0.59 and 0.59 mm,
L1 = 12.76, 2.48 and 3.46 mm and L2 = 3.47, 1.26 and 0.84
mm, at 5.9, 12.7 and 17 GHz, respectively.
B.
Phase Array Aantenn
An N-element linear array has a uniform amplitude and
spacing. In order to operate the overall radiation pattern of
the connection elements, we need to control several
parameters. These parameters include the N array elements
in the array, the distance between two adjacent antenna
elements, the orientation of each element for the feed
amplitude or phase shift. The array factor is expressed as:

where N is the number of elements, k is the wave number of
the radiated signal (k =2π/λ_RF), d is the spacing between
two antenna elements, θ is the spatial angle around the axis 
of orientation of the array and β is the phase shift of the
electrical signals that feed the antenna elements.
In order to discard the beam squint and to allow a wide
range of frequencies, the beam-forming, with OTTD is used.

Rather than producing a phase shift in the electrical signals
that influence the antenna elements, time delay phase shift
allows all frequencies to be steered in the same direction [5].
Therefore, the phase shift of the electrical signals must be
counted on frequency and can be expressed as:
                                  β = 2πf∆t
(3)
f is the frequency of the electrical signal and ∆t is time
delay phase shift.

EXPERIMENTAL ARCHITECTURE
The chamber is used for antenna pattern measurement.
Fig. 2 shows the system level diagram for a TTD beam-
former that uses a HDCF (DC-C-N-1020-UW-SC/APC/P)
and also shows the major modules of the system. The input
radio frequency signal (5.9, 12.7 and 17 GHz) is generated
by a Signal Generator (SG) and is proposed to Horn
Antenna (HA). The PAA receives signal from the HA and
transmit signal through port 2 to the Power Amplifier (PA)
and the distance between PAA and HA is from 120 cm to
150 cm. The wavelength of output laser from Tunable Laser
Source (TLS) is set from 1549.95 nm to 1550.2 nm. The
enhanced signal from the output for PA is injected into the
Mach-Zehnder Modulators (MZM) which modulates the
output of TLS. The PA is used to ensure enough input RF
power to drive MZM in order to overcome the dynamic
range and inherently high RF loss in the microwave cables
line and receiving RF signal that feed the system.
The modulated optical carrier is then fed into the
Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), which amplifies
the optical signal to avoid optical attenuation through
devices. Normally, when the wavelength of TLS increases,
the time delay decreases in the HDCF that compensates for
the dispersion in the standard Single Mode Fiber (SMF).
The optical signals are converted into electrical signals by
using 70 GHz pin Photo-Detectors (PD, XPDV3120R). A
signal from port 1 of PAA output with -35 dBm to 38 dBm
is injected into a power splitter which combine the signal
from the PD with -35 dBm to 38 dBm for analysis by a
spectrum analyzer and vector network analyzer HP 8510C.

forming. Signal from port 1 and port 2 of PAA output with -
35 dBm to 38 dBm are injected into a power splitter and
measured by a spectrum analyzer and vector network
analyzer HP 8510C.

RSULTS AND DISCUSSION
The
1×2-element
PAA
for
simulation
and
the
measurement
results
for
the
reflection
coefficient
characteristic, S11, are shown in Fig. 5. The measured -10
dB return loss bandwidths are from 5.8 to 6, 12.22 to 12.42
and 16.1 to 16.4 GHz (0.2, 0.2 and 0.3 GHz), and there is a
3.4, 1.5 and 1.8 percent bandwidth for the center frequency
of 5.9, 12.7 and 17 GHz, respectively. The S-parameter
performance is somewhat different to the simulation and
measurement results because of the fabrication undercut and
improper soldering of connectors. The fabricated antenna
was measured in an anechoic chamber and was analyzed
using an Agilent E5071C network analyzer.
The simulated and measured radiation patterns for the
relative phase are shown in Fig. 6, which shows a main lobe
at 0 degrees beam forming at 5.9, 12.7 and 17 GHz. In order
to better understand the phase properties of the beam
steering, the feed network for the 1× 2-element array is used.
The measured phases for the optical turn time delay at 5.9,
12.7 and 17 GHz are shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). The
phase from the output of power splitter and the group delay
of optical and electric signal are measured as shown in Fig.
7(a). The optical true time delays are approximately 20°,
35° and 40° per 0.1 nm at 5.9, 12.7 and 17 GHz,
respectively. As is seen, the optical true time can change
from -180° to 180° by purely tuning the wavelength of the
TLS to about 0.25 nm as shown in Fig. 7(b). The TLS is the
optical carrier with a tunable wavelength of 1549.95 to
1550.02 nm and serves as the optical source for the system.
Fig. 8 shows the simulated and measured array factors
for a 1×2-element PAA, using the proposed optical TTD. A
comparison of the measured results and the simulation
results is shown in Table 1. The range of scanning angles
for the far field radiation patterns can be tuned at least from
-22° to +29° at fixed frequencies of 5.9, 12.7 and 17 GHz,
using
proposed
OTTD technique.
The
simulated
and
measured results are in close agreement. The difference in
the measured beam-steering and the simulated angle may be
due to optical attenuation through the multiple devices and
to RF losses in the microwave cables that feed the array
system.
V.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
The proposed OTTD phased array antenna with wide
angle beam-steering is designed for a 1 × 2 array. Without
the OTTD system in the feed line, as shown in Fig. 4 , the
main lobe is directed along the 0° axis. However, in Fig. 8,
when the OTTD system is used in the feed lines, the main
lobe will be steering. The beam-peak is steered from 33° to -
22°, 30° to -27° and 29° to -25° at PAA frequency of 5.9,
12.7 and 17 GHz, respectively, where the wavelength of
TLS is tuned from 1549.95 to 1550.2 nm. It can be seen that
the beam-steering angle can be tuned by changing the phase
shift of the OTTD.
In the future work, the PAA will be increased the
number of elements scaling up 4 in the front-end system. It
can be used to reduce the phase adjustment scale and
therefore a much more accurate beam steering angle is
expected.
