Abstract- Business process models are often crucial for 
business software development. Using reference models or 
merged processes, software producers intend to optimize the 
development effort for enterprises of the same domain. Thus, it 
is important to know how to assess the similarity between the 
process and the reference or merged process model to assess 
the effort needed for their adaption. This paper uses network-
based business process analysis approach to quantitatively 
assess process similarity based on information structure of the 
business process model. Application of the approach as well as 
metrics used for similarity assessment is presented using a case 
study from the health management domain. 
Keywords- Business process analysis; process merging; network 
analysis. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Merging organizations, a new business unit created from 
existing business departments, a common information 
system for different business units or domains, all these 
aspects require merging of processes. In each of these cases 
similarities and differences between business sub-processes 
have to be identified and the differences must be resolved. 
Thus, before process merging it is necessary to assess the 
effort that will be needed changing them. This evaluation 
need is similar in cases when organization’s processes are 
evaluated towards their compliance with standard processes.  
Process merging is defined by [1] as the proceeding 
when “two or more process models have to be brought 
together in order to create an improved business process”. 
Solutions relying on information technology (IT) are often 
derived based on process models as they provide an initial 
insight into the business procedures. Process merging is a 
technique that is similar to process configuration but it 
requires the preservation of certain parts of the processes in 
focus as well as the preservation of the underlying structure 
of the IT systems. 
In this paper, the process merging technique is used to 
derive a common consignation process for two hospitals that 
need to be supported by a common information system. 
Thus, process merging is applied here in the context of 
business driven software development including business 
process analysis and enhancement. The research question 
here is, how to determine similarity of the as-is processes 
with regard to the to-be or merged process. Answers to this 
question will provide the enterprises, or in this case 
hospitals, as well as business software developers with an 
estimate on the effort as well as potential adaptation of the 
developed tool.  
The question on process model similarity has already 
been addressed in research from different angles, e.g., by [2]. 
Often, compliance with reference models or semantic 
compliance is in the focus of these activities. In this paper, 
quantitative analysis and comparison of process information 
structure in the process model is performed using metrics 
derived from network analysis. This approach allows 
repeatable and more objective results. Furthermore, the 
question of the defining dimensions of the fit of a particular 
process to the merged, reference or improved process arises 
and is also addressed using network-based business process 
metrics. 
Externalization 
of 
these 
aspects 
supports 
implementation of a new IT support tool and process by 
providing comparable and objectified results that otherwise 
had to be derived in expert interviews or a complementary 
process analysis.  
Being based in the information system research this 
paper presents the use of an approach for quantitative 
assessment of business process characteristics and inter-
process comparison using network-based business process 
analysis [3]. This approach is based on the view of a 
business process as a network, with process activities as 
nodes and information and message flows as links. It 
provides insights for theory and practice. From a practical 
point of view developing application systems or software in 
a specific industry requires elevation and implementation of 
similar processes. This is a rather cumbersome and resource 
consuming process. Assessment of similarity and differences 
between processes of the same domain but in different 
enterprises helps to estimate the effort needed for their 
implementation or change. Other techniques to measure 
process differences, e.g., process simulation, require more 
data than comprised in the process model, e.g., exact data on 
activity time and costs, which also needs to be elevated.  
In this paper, structural and communicational effects 
induced by the new merged process are assessed using the 
analysis of the to-be process model. A consignment process 
from two different hospitals is analyzed with the goal to 
develop supporting software for its execution. These 
processes are merged to provide an improved and more 
general process that can be integrated into the two hospitals.

The merged (to-be) process has been presented and 
discussed with the process managers and owners from the 
two hospitals who approved the feasibility and design of the 
resulting process. Network-based business process analysis 
is used here to quantitatively assess the differences and 
similarities of the two processes as well as the improvement 
effects and fit of the merged process providing comparable 
and repeatable results. The fit of an as-is process to the 
merged process is measured here using the difference 
between metrics of the both process networks. 
The paper unfolds as follows. In the following Section 
related work on process similarity assessment is reviewed. 
The case study and the processes are presented in Section 3. 
Section 4 briefly reviews the network-based business process 
analysis approach, while the analysis results are presented 
and discussed in Section 5. Conclusion and outlook finish 
the paper.

RELATED WORK 
Research on merged processes intersects several areas of 
business process management such as reference modeling 
and process comparison.  
Business process reference models are standard business 
process models for a specific business domain or industry 
that can be tailored to the needs of a specific company. 
Reference models can be tailored by describing their 
configuration options [2, 4]. These are patterns that pre-
define what differences can exist between possible users. 
These aspects are also used in the research on process 
differences and their classification by [5].  
Process merging was introduced by [1] as a variation of 
adaption of business processes to reference models by 
establishing correspondence between the two process 
models. The authors discuss process merging in the context 
of business driven software development [6]. Business 
driven development is a methodology for developing IT 
solutions that directly satisfy business requirements. 
Therefore, it strongly relies on the information captured in 
the business process model. 
Dijkman develops patterns for business process model 
differences as well as techniques to identify the differences 
by using a detection algorithm that was developed by 
formalizing frequently occurring differences discovered in 
practice in [5, 7]. Van der Aalst [2] uses process mining to 
detect the conformance of an executed business process with 
its descriptive model. Thus, he (quantitatively) compares the 
real behavior of a business process tracked in logs of the 
executing information system with the intended or expected 
behavior.  
Rozinat and van der Aalst [8] operationalize the fitness of 
the prescriptive and actually executed business models also 
using the process mining technique. The authors define 
process fitness as “[the] extent to which the log traces can be 
associated with valid execution paths speciﬁed by the 
process 
model”. 
Their 
approach 
allows 
detecting 
conformance problems in real-life scenarios. Nevertheless, 
the authors do not provide a possibility for quantitative 
assessment of the detected problems.  
Gerke et al. [9] developed an algorithm, which allows 
measuring the compliance, i.e., the degree to which a process 
model behaves in accordance to a reference model, of 
process models with reference models using the process 
structure. They developed an algorithm (using data obtained 
by process mining), called sequence- based compliance, 
which is based on the analyzing task sequences and 
comparing them to accordant sequences in the reference 
model. 
Described research activities approach process similarity 
on the level of semantics or tasks. The approach described in 
the next sections analyzes the process structure and derives 
accordant metrics. 
III. 
CASE STUDY  
The case study presented here in situated in the domain 
of health management. A consignment process in two 
hospitals (KHA and KHB) is in the focus of analysis. The 
case study is based on a process analysis project. The goal of 
the project was to analyze and subsequently improve the 
processes as well as to design a general consignment process 
that can be supported by an accordant software tool in both 
hospitals. Actors involved in the process (see Figures 1 and 
2) are the hospital, represented by ward, procurement and 
finance departments, a medical worker (in ward sub-process 
of KHB), an IT-system as well as a supplier. The goal of the 
process is to purchase the needed medical equipment and 
supplies and deliver them to the requesting ward. Due to the 
confidential agreement as well as the focus on structural 
analysis focus the process is only sketched here.

Processes from the two hospitals slightly differentiate in 
their use of the IT-system as well as involvement of the 
procurement department. These differences are partly due to 
the local circumstances, e.g., staff capacity, workload, etc., 
but the processes also show potential for workflow 
automation and involvement of the medical personnel. 
Hence, the processes were analyzed and merged to a more 
general and optimized process. 
The merged process was created on the basis of the two 
as-is processes but also as a results of the process analysis 
for process improvement (see Figure 3). Thus, its content 
and structure reflects the as-is processes but also integrates 
the suggested process improvements. Improvement efforts 
were directed towards a higher automation degree of the 
process, i.e., a higher involvement of IT system for 
document and collaboration management, as well as towards 
a more efficient management of medical material to ensure 
its fast and timely delivery. Nevertheless, performance 
measurement of the merged process will not be in focus of 
this paper. Here, the structure of each of the two as-is 
processes is compared to the structure of the merged process 
using network metrics described in the following section. 
Based on these metrics, the fit between as-is and the merged 
process is detected enabling assessment of changes 
introduced by the new process. In the context of software 
development this measurement enables an estimation of the 
effort that will be needed for the case dependent software 
implementation.  
IV. 
 NETWORK-BASED BUSINESS PROCESS ANALYSIS 
To address the research question on how to quantitatively 
measure process similarity using a business process model, 
network-based business process analysis as presented in [3] 
was chosen. This approach allows analysis of process 
structure and its characteristics using network metrics. Thus, 
business processes under analysis were transformed into 
accordant business process networks with business process 
activities as nodes and control as well as information flows 
as links. To analyze dynamic process characteristics, the 
notion of linkevent has been introduced. A linkevent is a 
relation between one or more nodes. Each linkevent can have 
one sender as well as no, one or more than one recipient(s) 
[10].  
Network metrics used for the analysis have been 
calculated using Commetrix® network analysis software and 
inserted into the discriminant functions and metrics (see 
Table 1 and 2) to define the process type and activity roles 
(see [3] for details on process definitions and approach).

DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS: OVERVIEW 
Following process types are distinguished here and can 
be identified using discriminant functions and metrics from 
Table 1: core, automatable, distributed, information, 
decision, communication and event intensive processes. Core 
processes are defined here as value-adding processes 
57

therefore involving direct customer interaction. A core 
process model includes an internal or external process 
customer. Automatable processes are defined here as 
repetitive, predictable [11], and indicating low level of 
variance, i.e., decisions or exceptions, in the control flow. 
Level of abstraction of the modeled process needs to be 
considered here, as processes presented on a high level of 
detail or containing multiple sub-processes can be considered 
as non-automatable in their full length. Information intensive 
processes are defined here as processes, which activities use 
information as a main resource, implying frequent 
information exchange within the process flow. A decision in 
this context can be identified as a choice between several 
process variants rather than a choice between two 
alternatives [12]. Thus, decision intensive processes were 
identified as processes containing an increased number of 
operative decisions [13]. Distributed processes were defined 
here as processes, which sub-processes are executed by 
different actors situated in different geographical locations. 
Communication intensive processes are defined as processes 
that require increased cooperation and communication 
activity from the process actors. To assess this process 
property, number of interrelation activities, i.e., linkevents 
LE, is normalized by the number of process activities n. 
Event intensive processes are processes that are defined by 
the state changes of business objects, i.e., the state of the 
business object defines the process flows. This characteristic 
can be considered as a feature of process complexity. Thus, 
the event intensiveness is assessed here similar to the 
coefficient of network complexity as defined by [14] by the 
quotient of links L, i.e., control and message flows within the 
process, and nodes n, number of process activities. 
Discriminant functions in Table 1 include following 
network 
metrics 
as 
variables 
defining 
behavioral 
characteristics of a process: average path length (PL), 
average clustering coefficient (CluCo), average connectivity 
and reach. Average path length indicates the average number 
of steps along the shortest paths (geodesic) for all possible 
pairs of network nodes, while reach denotes the degree of 
any member of the network, to which it can reach other 
network members. PL can be interpreted as a measure for the 
efficiency of information transport within the network. 
Connectivity (conn) of a network indicates how many nodes 
need to be removed to separate the network in several groups 
[15]. Clustering coefficient measures the interaction of nodes 
within an ego-network including transitive connections and 
indicates the transitivity of the node, i.e., its ability to 
distribute information directly with its neighbor nodes. Link 
strength (LS) is a measure based on the concept of linkevents 
and denotes how many linkevents have been exchanged on 
one link weighting the relationships between two nodes. 
Density is defined as the ratio of links present in the network 
and the maximum number of possible links [15]. Thus, it can 
also be used to refer to the stability of the network with 
respect to structural changes. Sparse density can be observed 
in communication networks as not all nodes are connected 
with each other [16]. Closeness centrality metric calculates 
the sum of the distance between a specific node and every 
other node in the network [17]. Thus, its value is inverse 
proportional to the distance between related nodes. The 
average closeness centrality of a network can provide insight 
on 
the 
collaboration 
and 
information 
distribution 
productivity within the network [18]. 
Business process activity roles were also analyzed here 
using the network-based business process analysis approach. 
These roles are: information sink and source, process sink 
and control activity. An information sink is a process activity 
that requires an increased amount of information for its 
execution. This role is defined using the number of received 
linkevents per node. Activities with an amount of received 
linkevents that is found in the third quartile of received 
linkevents is considered as an information sink. An activity 
that delivers information to other activities is considered as 
information source. These are activities from the third 
quartile according to number of sent linkevents. A process 
sink is an activity that is considered as the process goal, i.e., 
the activity that captures the control and information flows of 
the process. This is the activity with the highest number of 
linkevents received in the process. Control activities are 
identified using the metric of betweenness centrality [15]. 
Betweenness centrality indicates a node that lies in between 
of other pair of nodes [19], i.e., the node with the highest 
number of shortest paths passing from all vertices to all 
others through that node.  
V. 
APPLYING NETWORK-BASED PROCESS ANALYSIS 
Network-based business process analysis approach is 
used here to assess the changes in the process structure of the 
merged process as opposed to the as-is process structure. The 
goal is to provide process managers of KHA and KHB 
processes as well as software developers with a possibility to 
evaluate the future effort for process adjustement. 
Additionally, the use of (network) metrics allows a 
comparison between the as-is and merged process to show 
the impact of the improvement measures providing 
performance related insights to the process managers. Thus, 
process owners can assess whether the merged process 
enhances the process characteristics and in what ways. First, 
the network analysis results are presented and then discussed 
in this section. 
A.  Results Overview 
Using the network-based business process analysis 
approach process network metrics have been derived (see 
Table 2) and allow detection of the differences between the 
process in the two hospitals on process as well as activity 
levels. Thus, network metrics derived from the process 
models that were transformed into networks were inserted 
into the discriminant functions in Table 1 to define and 
compare the process types and informational characteristics 
of the processes. Further metrics as described in Section 4 
were used to define the roles of process activities in the 
information transportation within the process. Additionally, 
communication load of the process participants has been 
investigated using the count metric of the linkevents (see 
Figure 4).

Analysis of the process types showed that KHB process 
is more automated, more distributed, more information and 
decision intensive than the KHA process according to the 
results of the discrimination functions in Table 2. It is less 
customer-oriented (measured by using the core process type 
definition) with the hospital as customer.

TABLE II.  
PROCESS ANALYSIS RESULTS: OVERVIEW 
Process sink, i.e., process goal of the KHA and KHB is 
the “search for the material” activity executed by the 
procurement department. Control and core activities in KHA 
process is “scan the bill” and in KHB “send the order to 
supplier”, both executed by the IT tool. Figure 4 shows the 
number of linkevents executed by each process participant 
documenting their communication and information exchange 
activity. In the hospital KHA procurement is the actor with 
the major load of communication activity in the process 
while in KHB it is the ward. The IT tool is only sparsely 
involved in communication, supporting the identified process 
type definition as non-automatable.  
The to-be process for both hospitals (KHPlanned) is also 
analyzed using network-based process analysis. It is less 
complex than both of the as-is processes according to the 
increased diameter of the process network. Its increased 
average path length indicates less effective information 
transportation as well as the fact that the process is now more 
distributed according to the results of the Dv function. 
The value of Da for the to-be process suggests that the 
process can be broadly supported by IT. It is also less 
information and decision intensive than both of the as-is 
processes. Figure 3 also indicates that the communication 
activity is now shifted towards IT and the ward (for the KHA 
process). The main process activities remain the same 
comparing to the KHA and KHB processes.  
Delta analysis of the KHA and KHPlanned as well as 
KHB and KHPlanned processes is performed using the 
derived network metrics and is summarized in the \triangle 
metric in Table 2. This metric can also be used to assess the 
fit of the process structures to the planned process. \triangle 
indicates higher values for KHA and KHPlanned comparison 
than for KHB and KHPlanned comparison. KHA metrics are 
significantly different comparing to the KHPlanned metrics 
on the level of significance of α=10%, while KHB metrics 
are not significantly different.  
B. Discussion of the Results 
Comparing the network metrics shows that KHA process 
is less information and decision intensive as well as smaller 
in terms of number of nodes, links and linkevents comparing 
to the KHB process, suggesting a lower need of IT support 
involvement. It also shows a highly sensitive structure in 
terms of process changes, as indicated by the value of the 
average 
connectivity 
metric. 
Productive 
information 
communication is indicated in KHA by a high value of the 
average closeness centrality and density indicating a 
communication 
network, 
i.e.,, 
message-based 
communication between process tasks and actors. The 
smaller clustering coefficient value than the one of the KHB 
process suggests a smaller tendency of the actors to share 
information directly. Analysis of the KHB process shows 
that the ward personnel is strongly involved within the 
consignation process (see Figure 4). This activity restrains 
the capacity of the personnel to involve in their medical 
tasks.  
KHPlanned resulted as being a process that has a higher 
automation potential than the two as-is processes being more 
distributed as well as less communication intensive, as 
indicated by the decreased density as well as event intensity 
and complexity metrics. More distributed process with 
longer paths requires a stronger focus on information 
management by e.g., implementation of a document 
management system with access for all process participants. 
Communication activity analysis shows that on one hand the 
communication activity has been partly shifted to IT 
(indicating potentially faster response times) but also the fact 
that the communication load of the ward personnel increased 
for KHA and slightly decreased for KHB. This aspect needs 
to be analyzed in more detail to ensure that the (increased) 
involvement of the personnel is necessary and complies with 
their primer duty.  
The comparison of the network metrics showed that the 
to-be process merges and extends the characteristics of the 
59

two as-is processes. This fact suggests that the to-be process 
has been extended and improved to accommodate the draw-
backs of both processes. Communication analysis indicates 
that finance and procurement departments will need to adjust 
more to the new process. Density metric of the planned 
process suggests a communication network but also a loss in 
the potential for direct information distribution according to 
the only slightly higher clustering coefficient value 
comparing with the KHA process.  
Significant difference in the \triangle values indicates that 
the KHA process will need more effort for its adjustment to 
the merged process than the KHB process. Increased 
connectivity metric of the KHPlanned process indicates a 
less sensitive structure in case of process changes. Also the 
planned process might face a decrease in information 
accuracy as indicated by the decline of the average closeness 
centrality metric [18].  
As the communication activities were now shifted 
towards the IT system, statements suggested by these metrics 
need to be examined further using the actual performance 
related data to assess the actual gain or loss in performance 
related process indicators. Nevertheless, the trend shown by 
the metrics needs to be taken into account by process owner 
and manager. These results derived using network-based 
process analysis focus on the (informational) structure 
changes in the process without taking time or costs 
implications of the new process into account. These aspects 
need to be evaluated using further analysis techniques, e.g., 
business process simulation. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 
In this paper metrics derived using network-based 
business process analysis approach have been applied to 
assess structural process characteristics and therefore the 
delta between as-is and merged processes. This analysis 
allows valuable insights for process managers, owners and 
IT tool developers as they enable them to assess the induced 
process changes on one hand and the potential adjustment 
effort on the other hand. 
Presented approach for business process comparison can 
be applied on processes from different business domains to 
compare merged, as-is, to-be or reference processes on the 
level of information structure using their process models. Its 
application has been shown on a case study from the health 
management domain. To enrich the results with further 
insights, a performance comparison based on business 
process simulation including costs and time analysis can be 
added. 
The goal of the paper was to present the application of 
the quantitative comparison approach. Nevertheless, it will 
need further evaluation in future, more exhaustive case 
studies.
