Abstract—Internationally E-Government (E-GOV) has been 
broadly demonstrated as an anti-corruption instrument in extant 
research, based on the extensive analyses of E-GOV Development 
Index (EGDI) against Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). 
EGDI’s effectiveness in combating corruption ideally involves 
country-specific appropriate policy-driven development along its 
three constituent components: Human Capital Index (HCI), 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Index (TII), and Online 
Services Index (OSI). However, we argue that, while considering 
EGDI’s impact on lowering corruption, existing studies do not 
consider the heterogeneity among the countries in terms of their 
EGDI maturity levels. Also, past research does not delve into the 
analysis of the relative contribution of EGDI components in 
controlling CPI, which may very well vary with EGDI maturity 
level. We posit that, unless these determinants are explored, 
countries would lack in formulating right policies to strengthen 
the enablers they are currently weak in to fight against corruption. 
So, this paper aims to understand the exact role HCI, TII, and OSI 
play individually in alleviating corruption vis-à-vis how these 
index values vary across cohorts of countries having similar EGDI 
trajectories. Using longitudinal clustering based on EGDI, we first 
identify temporal country cohorts and then perform cohort-wise 
panel regression to analyze the individual effects of HCI, TII and 
OSI on CPI. As expected, the three components do not contribute 
uniformly in lowering corruption, and more importantly, each 
assumes significance only under different contingent internal 
factors. So, based on our results, we recommend, for each cohort, 
a set of specific E-GOV development policies targeted for 
combating corruption, thereby helping countries formulate long-
term and short-term measures toward moving up the E-GOV 
maturity stages too.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Corruption is a social menace that corrugates the 
foundations of a government machinery, thereby undermining 
the socio-economic welfare and well-being of the citizens 
nation-wide. Elbahnasawy [1] defines corruption as “a 
manifestation of the principal-agent problem owing to 
information asymmetry and non-alignment of incentives”. It 
has proved to be a major barrier for countries seeking to achieve 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) [2]. Extant research 
provides substantial evidence of the negative externalities, such 
as lowering of economic prosperity, increased environmental 
degradation, growing resource wastage, increased income 
inequalities, and growing poverty, propagated by corruption 
[3]. Taking cognizance of these negative externalities, 
controlling corruption has become imperative for governments 
all around the world. E-Government (E-GOV), which 
advocates the use of Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT) in the delivery of public services, has been 
demonstrated in past studies as an effective anti-corruption tool 
[4] to reduce information asymmetry and bring transparency in 
government service delivery [1][5][6]. In literature, E-GOV [5] 
is defined as “the use of ICTs to enable and improve the 
efficiency with which government services are provided to 
citizens, employees, businesses and agencies”. 
Corruption level of a country is usually estimated with the 
help of the well-known measure, called Corruption Perceptions 
Index (CPI), published annually by Transparency International 
[7]. Countries are given a score between 0 and 100, where “0” 
signifies highest corruption and “100” signifies lowest 
corruption [7]. On the other hand, E-GOV development of 
countries is assessed through the measure, called E-GOV 
Development Index (EGDI), published by the United Nations 
on a bi-annual basis from 2008 onwards (earlier published 
annually during 2003-2005) [6]. EGDI is a composite metric 
consisting of three components: (i) Human Capital Index (HCI) 
– that assesses the human capabilities (HC) and skill levels, (ii) 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Index (TII) – which 
assesses 
development 
levels 
of 
telecommunications 
infrastructure (TI), and (iii) Online Services Index (OSI) – 
which assesses the scope and quality of government’s e-
services or online services (OS) [6].  
Although recent research works [3]–[5] in the “E-GOV–
Corruption” discourse provide substantial evidence regarding 
the potential of E-GOV development in combating corruption, 
we have identified two inter-related research issues that have 
not been adequately addressed in the literature: (i) how the 
impact of E-GOV development on lowering corruption varies 
with the heterogeneity among countries through their temporal 
EGDI evolutions, due to the differing HC/TI/OS capabilities 
and differing levels of internal factors, and (ii) how the relative 
contribution of HC, TI and OS matters in managing corruption 
at various levels of E-GOV maturity across countries. The 
previous studies on E-GOV–Corruption, therefore, do not 
consider adequately the context-specific component-wise 
variations in the EGDI-CPI relationship. Hence, the policy 
recommendations mentioned in these studies are not complete 
and sufficient to a large extent, rendering such policies not

readily 
operationalizable 
at 
the 
country-level 
[8][9]. 
Consequent to such scant research focus and insufficient 
empirical guidance, countries may incorrectly estimate the 
exact impact of the three components, namely HC, TI, and OS, 
in reducing corruption, which could lead to incorrect 
prioritization and inefficient resource allocation and hence, sub-
optimal outcomes thereof [10].  
Our primary focus in this paper is on the context-specific 
role that HCI, TII and OSI play within EGDI in increasing CPI; 
to be more specific, the relative contribution of HC/TI/OS in 
reducing corruption. In order to avoid any over-estimation of 
HC/TI/OS’s impact, we have controlled for the effect of 
governance quality and economic factors on corruption. 
Towards this, firstly we have taken help of longitudinal 
clustering technique to group the countries into clusters 
(referred to as cohorts henceforth), based on the similarity of 
their EGDI trajectories across time; secondly, we have 
employed panel regression to understand the quantum of 
individual impact of HCI/TII/OSI on CPI for each of the 
cohorts. Finally, based on the above findings, we recommend 
context-aware cohort-specific E-GOV policies to provide 
guidance regarding the HC/TI/OS prioritization by countries 
and the enabling factors that the countries should take 
cognizance of, in order to harness the full potential of E-GOV 
development in combating corruption.  
Therefore, the paper contributes to the “E-GOV–
corruption” discourse in the following four ways: (i) we 
account for the heterogeneity among countries in their temporal 
EGDI evolution, taking cognizance of the dynamic similarities 
of countries across time, (ii) we identify the individual roles of 
HC, TI and OS in controlling corruption and the enabling 
conditions under which the effect of HCI/TII/OSI on CPI is 
significant, (iii) we combine the above two analyses by relating 
country-wise 
heterogeneity 
with 
E-GOV-corruption 
correlation, and (iv) we recommend, based on our unique 
combination of analyses, long-term and short-term E-GOV 
strategies closely aligned with the objective of lowering CPI.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The following 
section reviews the relevant literature, Section III outlines the 
research framework and methodology, Section IV presents the 
results and discussions. Section V finally concludes the paper. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND BACKGROUND 
Since our study draws from two distinct streams of 
literature: (i) Country-wise heterogeneity, and (ii) E-GOV-
corruption discourse, we begin with short introduction of each 
followed by brief survey of relevant works in each domain. 
A. Country-wise Heterogeneity 
We extend the definition of a firm’s competitive advantage, 
as defined in the Resource-Based View literature [11], to define 
country-level heterogeneity as “the distinct and unique 
characteristics inherent in countries due to their access to a 
unique bundle of resources and the subsequent development of 
capabilities and knowledge, not easily duplicated by other 
countries.” In the context of its influence on longitudinal E-
GOV development of countries, extant research provides 
evidence for two broad categories of variables to handle 
country-level heterogeneity - (i) Internal Capabilities, and (ii) 
Country-level Governance and Economic factors [3][10][11]. 
Adapting the definition of organizational capabilities [12], we 
define internal capability of a country as its ability to derive 
utility through deployment of valued resources, either in 
combination or copresence. Borrowing from the arguments in 
[11], internal capabilities differentiate countries in terms of 
their absorptive capacity, i.e., their ability to assimilate and 
make use of available knowledge or technology (including ICT 
which leads to E-GOV). This, in turn, highlights the importance 
of internal capabilities in creating unique country-level 
attributes. At the same time, there exists sufficient empirical 
evidence of governance and economic factors, such as judicial 
independence, economic prosperity, institutional strength, and 
press freedom, having a significant role in fostering E-GOV 
development in a country [13]. Hence, it becomes imperative 
that, while using EGDI, one should take country-wise 
heterogeneity into consideration properly. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study 
on explaining E-GOV-corruption connect has longitudinally 
incorporated such country-wise heterogeneity, arising out of 
the 
combined 
effect 
of 
internal 
capabilities 
and 
governance/economic factors acting over time. Few studies that 
try to differentiate among countries, however, either attribute 
such differences to geographical affiliations [9] or confine to 
single time-period, thereby ignoring the underlying structural 
differences among countries over temporal domain. To 
circumvent these limitations, we invoke longitudinal clustering 
– a technique that captures the underlying dynamic structural 
similarities of countries by grouping countries based on some 
variable (EGDI in this study) over a time-period, as explained 
in details in Section III. 
B. E-GOV and Corruption Discourse 
 Existing studies in the E-GOV-corruption discourse have 
demonstrated the ability of E-GOV in lowering corruption at 
the broader index level [1][5][13], as well as at the individual 
resource levels, such as Internet diffusion, citizens’ educational 
capability, or mobile phone penetration [8][9]. However, extant 
studies are silent on taking the country-wise heterogeneity into 
proper consideration while analyzing the E-GOV-corruption 
relationship. Furthermore, these studies have missed out on the 
possibility that the said heterogeneity may stem from the 
variations in HC/OS/TI capabilities of countries. Extant studies 
[5][13]–[16], therefore, have not empirically studied the effect 
of HCI/OSI/TII on corruption. Consequently, the EGDI-
corruption relationship has never been explored at the sub-
index level (i.e., at the level of HCI, TII and OSI), to the best of 
our knowledge. However, unless such understanding is 
explored, countries would be unable to leverage on the strength 
of their internal capabilities, meanwhile lacking in policies to 
strengthen the sub-index they are weak in. Moreover, the use of 
the broad index EGDI masks the inter-country differences in 
their sub-index prioritizations. For example, Chile and Czech 
Republic have almost identical EGDI viz. 0.60137 and 0.60695 
in 2010 and 2014, respectively [6]. However, there are marked 
differences at the levels of their EGDI components. While Chile 
is much superior to Czech Republic in terms of OSI (0.60952 
2

vs 0.37007), it lags Czech Republic in terms of TII (0.27109 vs 
0.57532). As existing literature does not clearly spell out the 
relative contribution of each of the three components of EGDI 
on CPI, countries, therefore, face decision uncertainties while 
formulating their E-GOV development strategies. Due to 
resource limitations, which is a reality in many countries, some 
countries may choose to provide more emphasis on one or two 
of the critical components at the expense of other less 
significant component(s), thereby failing to utilize their limited 
resources effectively [10]. 
Our motivation behind delving deeper into the sub-index 
level comes from the following observation. Despite lack of 
studies probing HC/TI/OS’s effect on corruption individually, 
there exist empirical evidences that point towards the 
possibility of each component having its own significant effects 
in lowering corruption. Education levels and access to 
education have been shown to lower corruption [13], thereby 
building a strong case for HCI’s significance in increasing CPI. 
In support of TII, Internet diffusion and cellphone subscription 
[8] (both being sub-components of TII) have been shown to 
have significant influence in lowering corruption. In support of 
OSI, digitalization of government services has been shown to 
increase transparency, which is an antecedent of reduction in 
corruption. Furthermore, enablers of E-GOV service usage, 
such as Internet adoption has been shown to lower corruption 
levels [8]. We, therefore, posit that the three EGDI components 
– HCI, TII, and OSI – have significant effects in increasing CPI 
in their own capacities alone. 
III. RESEARCH FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY 
As mentioned earlier, we first account for country-wise 
heterogeneity by employing longitudinal clustering to group 
countries with similar EGDI levels. Next, within each group, 
we use panel regression for testing the effects of HC, TI, and 
OS in lowering corruption as per the model of Figure 1, which 
captures the overall structure of the conventional research 
framework used in this kind of study [3]–[5]. We assume that 
HCI, TII and OSI (on the left part of Figure 1) are the three 
basic capabilities derived out of EGDI that contribute to CPI, 
subject to the internal factors (on the right part) explained below 
in details. 
A. Research Model 
Our model (Figure 1) aims to draw upon the resource-based 
view of countries to understand how the unique mix of 
HC/OS/TI capabilities, subject to governance and economic 
factors, contribute to corruption control. We control for the 
effects of governance and economic factors on corruption in 
order to avoid over-estimation of HC/TI/OS’s effects on 
corruption. Regarding the control variables, though there is no 
universally agreed upon set as determinants of corruption, 
based on the existing literature [1], we make use of five control 
variables, namely Government Effectiveness (GE) [17], which 
operationalizes Institutional Strength (IS), Rule of Law (RL) 
[17], which operationalizes Law and Order (L&O), Anti Press 
Freedom (APF) [18], Trade Openness (TO) [17], and Economic 
Prosperity (EP) [17], which represent the degree of political and 
economic freedom enjoyed by the citizens of a country. Causes 
of corruption have been consistently found, in extant research, 
to be deeply rooted in these governance (that contribute to 
political freedom [13]) and economic factors [1][3][13], and 
have therefore been extensively used as control variables. We 
consider IS as the variable that captures GE, as shown in Table 
I, which provides a summary of all variables used in our study. 
B. Data Sources 
Our study uses a balanced panel dataset consisting of 102 
countries with data ranging from 2003 to 2016. The dataset 
comprises 8 time periods with consecutive time-period data 
from 2003 to 2005 and alternative year’s data from 2008 
onwards due to non-availability of EGDI data (the United

Nations did not publish the same for the other years). EGDI data 
contain the three component level data too for HCI, TII and 
OSI. All the four measures viz. EGDI, HCI, TII and OSI score 
countries on a scale of 0 to 1, where “0” signifies low and “1” 
signifies high. The outcome variable, namely corruption, has 
been operationalized using CPI, published annually by 
Transparency International [7]. Table II provides the 
descriptive statistics of all the variables. Our dataset provides a 
total of 816 observations for every variable. 
C. Methodology 
Our methodology consists of two primary sequential steps: 
(i) longitudinal clustering based on EGDI trajectory, and (ii) 
panel data regression within each cluster. 
a) EGDI Trajectory based Clustering 
Although there are several clustering techniques available 
[19], our study employs the commonly used k-means clustering 
technique to create longitudinal cohorts of countries in order to 
capture the dynamic similarities of some countries across time. 
The k-means based algorithm, being an unsupervised learning 
technique, does away with the need to pre-specify the number 
of clusters, hence being appropriate for our exploratory study, 
where the number of clusters is unknown. Some related works 
have done region-specific studies using single time-period data 
[9]. However, they have not used any clustering technique per 
se. So, our paper is the first of its kind to use multi-time period 
clustering employing k-means technique. As mentioned earlier, 
the factor we have used for the longitudinal clustering is the 
EGDI trend from 2003 through 2016. We have used the “kml” 
package present in the open source statistical programming 
language “R” for conducting the clustering analysis. After 
testing with various values of k, we have narrowed down to four 
cohorts, namely A, B, C and D, (Figure 2) because four clusters 
maximize the Calinski-Harabasz Index [20] in the case of 
EGDI. Table III provides the list of countries included in each 
cohort post our analysis. Cohort A represents the largest group 
with 34 countries, while cohort D represents the smallest group 
with 20 countries. 
b) Panel Data Analysis 
Compared to only cross-sectional data or pure time series 
data, panel data includes the inter-individual, as well as the 
intra-individual differences, besides containing information 
along both cross-sectional and temporal dimensions. This suits 
our research requirement perfectly. Moreover, panel data 
analysis has several advantages including: (i) the ability to 
model and/or test more complex behaviors and/or hypotheses 
[21], (ii) the ability to control the effect of omitted variable 
biases, and (iii) the ability to handle the effect of inter-
individual dependencies as 
well as correlation (aka 
dependency) across time. This is not possible in other 
techniques (like Ordinary Least Squares [21]) due to violation 
of independence assumption [21].  
Our research model uses two approaches for fitting the 
panel data: (i) Within Group Fixed Effects Regression, and (ii) 
Random Effects Regression [21]. We have used Hausman test 
[21] to identify the appropriate model for each cohort. Prior to 
running the models, the dataset was tested for the presence of 
fixed effects using Chow test, post which the time effect and 
the individual effects were tested using the Lagrange Multiplier 
test developed by Breusch and Pagan [21]. The Random Effects 
model have been run using either the Swamy Arora’s 
Transformation [21] or the Wallace-Hussain Transformation 
[21]. Heteroskedasticity was tested using Breusch Pagan test 
[21] and was detected in majority of the models. Therefore, we 
have calculated heteroskedasticity robust estimates, using 
Arellano’s and White’s method [21], for Fixed Effects and 
Random Effects regression, respectively. The dataset was 
tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey Fuller test 
[21], where all variables were found to be stationary. 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
We present here our findings, which provide substantial 
evidence regarding the existence of cohort-wise differences in 
the EGDI levels, as well as cohort-specific roles of the different 
EGDI components in lowering corruption. 
A. Cohort-specific Characteristics 
Our findings provide evidence of significant inter-cohort 
differences regarding their EGDI trajectories. Figure 2 shows 
the result of the EGDI-based longitudinal clustering, where the 
vertical axis in the right side of the figure denotes EGDI levels

while the horizontal axis denotes the time period. Table IV 
provides a descriptive summary of the four cohorts (Table III) 
identified therefrom. Cohort C represents the countries at the 
higher end of the spectrum across all the variables used in the 
study, while cohort D represents the countries at the lower end 
of the spectrum across all the variables. In between, we have 
cohorts B and A. It can be observed that countries with similar 
levels of governance levels (IS/L&O/APF), internal capabilities 
(HCI/TII/OSI), and economic factors (TO/EP) have similar 
longitudinal EGDI trajectories demonstrated by their automatic 
affiliation to distinct cohorts (Table IV). Countries are 
identically clustered for all the variables considered in this 
study. In other words, cohort D is the cluster with the lowest 
average value for all the variables, cohort C is the cluster with 
the highest average value for all the variables, with cohorts B 
and A in between. Our results provide evidence regarding (i) 
heterogeneity among countries in terms of their EGDI evolution 
trajectories, and (ii) the heterogeneity being contingent on the 
level of internal capabilities and governance quality/economic 
development levels of countries. As posited, our clustering 
result provides sufficient evidence of   country-wise 
heterogeneity in EGDI evolution trajectories. 
B. EGDI Components and CPI 
The panel regression summary indicates some cohort-wise 
variations in the way EGDI components affect corruption. As 
observed in Table V: (i) cohorts A and B, both with relatively 
steeper EGDI trajectories, have TII as the only EGDI 
component having a significant effect on CPI. Besides TII, 
governance factors, namely IS, and L&O, are significant for 
both cohorts, while TO and EP differentiate the two cohorts, (ii) 
cohorts C and D, both with relatively flat EGDI trajectories 
have HCI as the only EGDI component having a significant 
effect on CPI. Besides HCI, IS has a significant effect on CPI 
for both the cohorts, and (iii) OSI does not have a significant 
effect on CPI for any of the cohorts. Thus, our findings indicate 
that the three EGDI components are not uniform in their 
contribution in lowering corruption. The roles of HCI and TII 
in lowering corruption assumes significance only under specific 
contexts, while OSI has no significant effect on CPI. 
C. Temporal Analysis of E-GOV Trajectories 
In terms of the EGDI trajectory and the relationship 
between EGDI components and CPI, the four cohorts can be 
grouped under two broad categories: (i) an unstable 
transitionary trajectory observed for cohorts A and B, where TII 
has a significant effect in lowering corruption, and (ii) a stable 
flat trajectory observed for cohorts C and D, where HCI has a 
significant effect in lowering corruption. From these 
observations, we draw short-term E-GOV policy measures for 
combating corruption. For cohorts with flat trajectories, HCI 
needs to be given focus in order to lower corruption, whereas

countries in cohorts where EGDI is transitioning towards 
mature levels need to prioritize TII in order to lower corruption. 
As expected, IS has significant effects in lowering corruption 
for all four cohorts; so overall IS cannot be ignored if corruption 
control is desired. L&O has a significant role to play only after 
countries begin the transition, as can be deduced from L&O’s 
insignificance on corruption for cohort D. EP influences 
corruption only for countries which are at the initial transition 
stage (cohort A), which highlights the importance of purchasing 
capacity of citizens to avail the ICT services. For cohorts at 
higher maturity levels, EP’s effect in lowering corruption loses 
significance. As EGDI levels mature (cohorts B and C), TO and 
APF, which foster greater transparency in trading practices, as 
well as information dissemination, start assuming greater 
importance in lowering corruption. 
On a longer term, countries need to plan how they can 
transition towards cohorts with higher maturity in terms of their 
EGDI and corruption levels. Although countries need to 
develop their overall levels for all variables used in this study 
to gain membership to the next mature cohort, there are certain 
factors that should receive higher prioritization on a long-term 
basis as deduced from the panel regression analysis. 
Accordingly, we have recommended adequate short-term and 
long-term prioritization of EGDI components, governance and 
economic factors for each cohort as summarized in Table VI. 
By focusing on the appropriate factors that have significant 
effects on corruption, countries could hasten their shift to the 
next higher mature cohort, while their EGDI strategy being in 
close alignment with corruption reduction.  
V. CONCLUSIONS 
The relationship between E-GOV and socio-economic 
welfare has received major focus in extant research. This line of 
research helps justify the investments that go into building the 
requisite infrastructure for E-GOV, and therefore the importance 
on national E-GOV strategy formulation. Our study also falls in 
this line of inquiry, where we explore the impact of E-GOV 
development on corruption, while taking cognizance of 
associated country level factors, such as IS, L&O, APF, TO and 
EP. We have found that countries are not homogeneous in their 
EGDI maturity, and heterogeneity is due to the combined effects 
of internal capabilities, as well as governance and economic 
factors. Furthermore, the EGDI components that have 
significant effects on lowering corruption are different for the 
different cohorts of countries. So, there is a need for a context-
aware prioritization of EGDI components in order to harness the 
benefits of EGDI in controlling CPI. Towards this, we have 
derived short-term and long-term E-GOV policy measures, for 
each of the cohorts, geared towards lowering of corruption, as 
summarized in Table VI. For instance, let us consider cohort D, 
which is at the lowest EGDI maturity level primarily due to the 
absence of adequate capabilities in terms of TII, as well as EP 
(Table IV). This warrants cohort D to emphasize on TII and EP 
as part of their long-term policy measures.  
Some limitations of this study include unavailability of data 
for all countries thereby limiting our dataset, and the use of 
perception-based measures that suffer from subjectivity. 
Alternative measures could be derived based on the sentiment 
data mined from social media, or online discussion forums. Our 
plan for future works goes like this. Additionally, survey 
instruments 
capturing 
perception 
measures 
could 
be 
administered using these online communities or social media, 
thus leveraging on new avenues for data collection. We have 
used the k-means longitudinal clustering for grouping the 
countries. We intend to repeat this work using other clustering 
methods and compare the results for robustness. Additionally, 
we wish to further work on uncovering the additional reasons 
for the decreasing CPI despite increasing EGDI observed for 
cohort C.
