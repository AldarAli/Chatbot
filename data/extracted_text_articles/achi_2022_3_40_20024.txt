Abstract— In the last two years, university teaching has been 
strongly influenced by online formats, mainly by video 
conference systems. Beyond that, there are also some practical 
examples for the use of immersive environments in higher 
education, mainly focused on the usage of virtual reality (VR) or 
augmented reality (AR) environments. However, this study aims 
to see if immersive 2D environments are also holistically suitable 
for teaching in terms of presence, participation, collaboration, 
and active learning for higher education, as they can offer 
advantages over video conferencing systems, but are not as 
costly as VR and AR solutions. A Master's program at the 
University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt was 
chosen for the study. The selected course was held completely in 
an 
immersive 
2D 
environment 
over 
one 
semester. 
Accompanying the course, subjects were asked to complete the 
Online Learning Environment Survey (OLLES) questionnaire 
weekly for analysis. Thereby a descriptive evaluation of the 
questionnaire takes place. All dimensions of the OLLES 
questionnaire achieve high to very high values. From a purely 
descriptive point of view, it can therefore be assumed that the 
used immersive 2D environment is holistically suitable as a 
learning environment in the tertiary sector. Nevertheless, this 
should be further explored in future studies by also comparing 
different 
courses 
(immersive 
2D 
environments, 
video 
conferencing systems, VR/AR environments, and real-world 
teaching lectures) to make even stronger statements.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
University teaching has been heavily influenced by online 
teaching over the past two years as a result of the COVID 19 
pandemic measures. Besides the isolated usage of VR or AR 
environments [1], primarily the classic video conferencing 
tools such as “zoom”, “GoToWebinar” or “Cisco Webex” 
were used, according to their market shares [2]. All of the 
classic video conferencing tools use video and audio 
transmission in a simple representation of the participants on 
the screen of the end device. Due to the continuous and time-
consuming use of these systems, signs of fatigue and 
weariness could be observed, often referred to as "zoom 
fatigue" [3] [4] also and especially for university students 
within online courses [5]. However, it can be assumed that 
online communication and events will continue in the future 
after COVID 19 pandemic [6]. Therefore, alternatives or 
additions to classic video conferencing systems such as VR 
should also be analyzed in order to check their suitability, 
especially for online university lectures. A first pilot study 
showed higher spatial and social presence for VR group 
meetings in comparison with video conference systems [7]. In 
contrast to video conferencing systems, the representation of 
the participant in VR is integrated into a virtual world and 
allows to explore and interact within a dynamic virtual 
environment [8]. 
Further, within this introduction there are given some 
definitions and explanations about the basic terms like VR and 
immersion and the status quo of VR in education and virtual 
learning environments (VLE). Section 2 shows the related 
works for VR and VLE in higher education and especially in 
tertiary education. Section 3 presents the virtual learning 
environment gather.town and their specific software features 
which are used in the study and also the measuring instrument 
OLLES [9] for analyzing the different dimensions. Section 4 
resumes the results, which are then discussed in detail in 
Section 5. The paper is finished with Section 6 to describe 
limitations and give an outlook to further work. 
A. VR/immersion 
VR can be distinguished between immersive VR (I-VR) 
including additional devices like a head mounted display 
(HMD) and non-immersive VR on the screen of some end 
devices, also declared as desktop VR (D-VR) [10]-[13]. Di 
Natale even suggest a three-way division between non-
immersive systems like desktop VR (D-VR), semi-immersive 
systems like AR or wide field displays and immersive systems 
like HMD or special designed rooms with projected walls 
(CAVE) [14]. While the definition for VR seems to be clear 
in literature, the term of immersion is a multifaceted concept 
without clarification [1]. On the one side, immersion is viewed 
as a kind of objective characteristics in terms of technical 
systems and affordances [15] or a psychological subjective 
characterized by one’s perception of presence and interaction 
[16]. While Bergstrom defines immersion as an objective 
property of the platform environment and presence as a 
subjective feeling [17], it seems that the term of immersion 
started to become synonymous with “presence” [18]. Despite

the strict separation between non-immersive and immersive 
VR, recent studies tend to consider immersion as a kind of 
continuum from highly immersive or high-end for I-VR and 
low immersive or low-end for desktop VR systems (D-VR) 
[18]-[20]. This is probably because there can be some kind of 
immersion and spatial presence on desktop VR systems as 
well. 
B. VR in education 
The high-end immersive VR seems to fascinate and 
inspire people in their first reaction, probably because of the 
high level of immersion and appearance [21]. Especially in 
terms of education, there were several announcements about 
ground breaking improvements by the usage of immersive 
VR, like increasing memory capacity or making better 
decisions [23]. Wu et.al. reported that I-VR-lectures are more 
effective than non-immersive environments [24] and Gao 
assumes better learning outcomes because I-VR is more 
engaging than traditional methods [25]. A meta-study found 
that the majority of studies on immersive learning 
environments from 2014-2019 used AR or VR applications, 
although all forms of immersion in learning and education 
were explicitly included. Among other things, the study shows 
the need for more research on less immersive learning 
environments with higher narrative and greater challenge [1]. 
Although the level of immersion in desktop VR systems is not 
as intense as fully immersive VR technologies, it is not the 
case that higher immersion and presence directly lead to better 
learning performance [19]. Johnson-Glenberg discovered, 
that the main effect for better learning is not the level of 
immersion between 2D or 3D virtual environment but the 
level of embodiment. The study compared the learning 
outcomes between groups learning with a low immersion 
platform on a desktop and a high immersive platform with an 
HMD (I-VR). The low embodied I-VR group performed 
significantly worse than the desktop group with high level 
embodying [18]. Radianti, states that immersive VR 
technologies are particularly used in education, even if their 
level of maturity still seems questionable and there are several 
research gaps [26]. Hamilton found in his literature review 
that in most I-VR studies between 2013 and 2019, there was a 
significant benefit of using I-VR in education. But he also 
restrict that most studies used short interventions and were 
mainly focused on scientific topics such as biology or physics 
[13]. Additionally, there are still limitations remaining, while 
using immersive VR. Besides higher costs for immersive VR, 
above all cyber sickness in terms of e.g. headache, blurred 
vision or dizziness are effects of using HMD technologies 
[27]. This is one reason why such systems should be used only 
for a limited span of time [28]. Due to this and considering the 
specific requirements and accommodations for university 
lectures, desktop VR applications appear to be more suitable 
for online education [9] [29] [20]. 
C. Virtual learning environment (VLE) 
Another keyword often used in connection with virtual 
learning is virtual learning environment (VLE). This term 
includes a wide range of systems like simple web pages, 
learning management systems like MOODLE but also three-
dimensional learning environments like Second Life or 
OpenSim [30]. Reisoğlu, following Zuiker, defines the term 
"3D Virtual Learning Environment (3DVLE)" and describes 
it as platforms for virtual worlds with avatars as 
representatives and the ability to communicate via audio or 
text, such as Second Life or OpenSim  [31] [32]. Other authors 
use the term of “immersive 3D virtual world” or “immersive 
3D virtual environment” for similar systems to describe 
computer based simulated environments in which users are 
able to immerse themselves through avatars [33] [34]. We will 
follow 
the 
wording 
of 
“immersive 
3D/2D 
virtual 
environment” to describe desktop VR with different levels of 
immersion. Within this paper we do not include learning 
management platforms (LMS) for distribution of contents, 
messages, notices and communication via forums and chats, 
like e.g. Moodle although they are included in the term of 
virtual learning environment (VLE) [35] [36]. We want to 
focus on low immersion desktop solutions that provide the 
ability to move, interact, collaborate, and communicate in a 
kind of virtual environment using an avatar. The aim is to use 
them for online master lectures at universities. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
There are already a number of studies and experiences for the 
use of virtual learning environments in higher education 
which are presented below.  
A. Immersive VR (I-VR) in higher education 
There are several studies on the impact of mainly 
immersive VR (I-VR) in higher education. Chien et.al. stated 
that a VR environment increases the motivation and critical 
thinking skills [37]. Tepe concluded that a VR environment 
increases performance and professional skill development 
[38]. Other studies also showed several positive effects on the 
academic success and motivation [39] [40]. Wen-Yu Lee 
discovered higher scores in science concepts for sixth-grade 
students learning with I-VR systems in comparison to students 
without the help of immersive systems [41]. In the field of 
higher education, a meta-study analyzed studies on desktop-
based virtual environments, games and simulations in 
particular. They concluded that these virtual tools could be 
effective in improving learning outcomes [12]. Mystakidis et. 
al. conducted a literature review analyzing the outcomes of 
distant learning and their effect on various criteria of "deep 
and meaningful learning" such as cognitive, social or affective 
aspects for K-12 high school students. As a result, positive 
outcomes were found, especially in terms of performance, 
satisfaction, cooperation and motivation. Although it is also 
emphasized that insufficient didactic quality cannot be 
compensated by online formats [42]. In a metastudy on the 
effects of immersive VR on students' academic performance, 
Akgün concluded that there are many positive effects on 
students' abilities, such as an increase in motivation and other 
positive contributions to learning. Despite to these positive 
results, the study also determined that there are still technical 
and health problems to be solved [43].  
B. Virtual learning environment (VLE) in higher education 
In addition, studies with desktop VR in higher education 
detected better performance achieved in groups using desktop 
45

VR. However dependent from the individual spatial ability 
[44]. Reisoğlu analyzed studies between 2000 and 2015 on 3D 
virtual learning environments (3DVLEs) and various aspects 
such as platforms used, research topics, and achievements. He 
found that the Second Life platform is the most used platform 
and that studies on 3DVLEs peaked around 2012 for 
simulation and learning support. He concluded some overall 
positive emotional and cognitive achievements on presence, 
satisfaction, communication skills and engagement [31]. 
Coffey also analyzed the second life platform against a normal 
computer surface for comparing the impact on intercultural 
sensitivity and reveals significant gains with the usage of a 
virtual environment [34]. Another study analyzed the effects 
of collaborative learning in virtual environments with the use 
of 3D avatars in a virtual learning environment (VLE). The 
results showed that regardless of a collaborative group or an 
individual group, learning improved, but participation in a 
collaborative group had a significant positive effect on 
academic achievement and satisfaction in higher education 
[45]. In a systematic literature review on "simulation games", 
it was discovered that better results in terms of declarative 
knowledge, procedural knowledge and knowledge retention 
could be achieved through the use of desktop-based 
immersive environments for the education of trainees [46]. 
C. VR/VLE in tertiary education:  
One of the early publications on "desktop 3D learning 
environments" without the use of head-up displays in tertiary 
education comes from Charles Sturt University. Here it is 
already pointed out that a desktop application is easier for the 
users and reduces physical and psychological stress compared 
to immersive virtual worlds with head-mounted displays [47]. 
A combination of learning management system with Moodle 
and 3D desktop environment with OpenSim was used in a 
study to design and evaluate a VLE for teaching with 
undergraduate students. There were effects on learning skills 
and understanding of sociocultural aspects that have a strong 
impact on social interaction when students participate and 
collaborate in common tasks and activities [30]. Collaboration 
and interaction seemed to be a high demanded factor 
influencing VLE systems, either by students and also 
academic staff [48]. A special form of 3D virtual learning 
environment is used for analyzing dental students’ 
performance. When comparing stereoscopic 3D vision with 
passive circular polarized glasses to 2D vision on screen, 
significantly better results and higher appreciation for the 3D 
vision were found [49]. Another specific anatomy medical 
study about the role of stereopsis in virtual and mixed reality 
conducted that virtual and mixed reality is inferior to physical 
models [50].  
Overall, there are several studies of desktop VR (D-VR) 
respectively VLE for specific topics, often computer science 
or medicine [28] [49]-[51]. These studies include various 
intensities of immersion, but still lack an evaluation of the 
overall and holistic suitability of 2D desktop learning 
environments for higher education, including the new 
immersive 2D environments that have appeared in the last 
three years. 
III. METHOD 
In the following we present the immersive learning 
environment gather town, in which the course took place and 
the measuring instrument OLLES, which was used for the 
assessment. 
A. Immersive 2D environment gather.town 
The software gather.town [52] was used as an immersive 
2D environment. This is a web conferencing software that 
allows to create a complete virtual replica of the teaching 
building. Within this virtual space, users can move around 
using avatars and interact with each other and their 
environment. Similar to real life. If the avatars now walk 
around in the virtual environment and then meet each other at 
a certain distance, the camera and the microphone of the 
computers are automatically switched on and the users have 
the opportunity to communicate. The graphical user interface 
is quite simple and it does not demand any special 
requirements to run on a variety of computers. In preparation, 
the entire real seminar building was recreated in the 
gather.town 
environment 
and 
the 
following 
virtual 
environment settings and software features were used: 
1) Podium: 
The podium is the classic teaching situation (see Fig. 1). 
Within the gather.town environment, all students and the tutor 
are in one large room. The tutor stands in front at the lectern, 
while the students take their places at the tables. All students 
can see, hear and of course communicate with each other via 
camera and microphone. It is possible to share the screen to 
provide lecture slides or other content to all participants in the 
plenum area. In this way, the tutor can use lecture slides in 
addition to a verbal execution of the learning topic, as they 
would be used in a real teaching situation. 
 
 
Figure 1. This is the podium. You can see a classic teaching situation in a 
shared space. 
 
2) Whiteboard: 
The whiteboard (see Fig. 2) provides an opportunity for 
collaborative work. To do this, the whiteboard must first be 
activated. After that, all users who access the whiteboard at 
the same time can work together on it. This means that all 
users get write permissions and can interact with the 
whiteboard. In addition, a video and audio function for 
communication is available for the workgroup to discuss and 
exchange while working on the board.

Figure 2. In the upper part of the picture, you can see the whiteboard placed 
in the room. Below you can see the view when using the interactive 
whiteboard. 
3) Workshops: 
Workshops are smaller rooms that provide fewer seats 
than the large seminar rooms. Here, there are tables with seats 
and a whiteboard (see Fig. 3). Thus, the users have the 
possibility to do smaller group work. They can use the table 
for meetings via the camera, or the whiteboard for joint work 
or screen sharing for presentation. 
 
 
Figure 3. Here you can see a small workshop room with several seats and a 
whiteboard in the room. 
 
4) Group discussion: 
This is a room that is designed in such a way that a pro and 
a con side can sit opposite each other and participate in a group 
discussion by means of the camera (see Fig. 4). The whole 
setting is accompanied by possible viewers, but would also be 
monitored by a jury that rules the discussion and evaluates the 
individual arguments. 
 
 
Figure 4. This is a group discussion room, where users sit across from each 
other in teams and a jury sits in the middle. 
5) Break rooms: 
In the break rooms, users can stay between the individual 
seminars and have the opportunity to play various card games 
at a game table, making music or watching videos (see Fig. 5). 
In another break room, users have the opportunity to get on a 
yoga mat. A 10-minute instructional video is then played so 
users can join in on the yoga session from home. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Here you can see the break rooms, where multiple users can gather 
and share interactive applications like a gaming table or a yoga room where 
a yoga tutorial is played as a video as soon as you step onto one of the green 
mats. 
6) Other Interactive Objects: 
Within the environment, other interactive objects are 
stationed in the individual rooms or corridors. In the entrance 
area, for example, there is a blackboard on which the timetable

can be viewed, and next door, there is a tutorial that once again 
describes the functionality of the gather.town environment in 
a video. There is also a bookcase. If you use it, you get a web 
window within the gather.town environment, which leads you 
to the online catalog of the university (see Fig. 6). There the 
literature search can be accomplished. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. In the upper part of the picture, you can see a bookshelf, which 
stands freely in the room. Below is the view when you use the bookshelf. 
This is the online catalog of the university. 
B. Measuring instrument 
The OLLES questionnaire in its modified 35-item form 
was used as the measurement instrument [9]. The OLLES 
questionnaire is a web-based survey instrument for use in 
online learning environments in tertiary education. In this 
context, the OLLES questionnaire provides inferences about 
students' perceptions of interaction opportunities within an 
online environment in terms of economy and efficiency. The 
dimensions of the OLLES are Student Collaboration (SC), 
Computer Competence (CC), Active Learning (AL), Tutor 
Support (TS), Information Design and Appeal (IDA), Material 
Environment (ME), and Reflective Thinking (RT). In 
addition, questions about general computer use and Internet 
use were also recorded. All items were measured using a 5-
point Likert scale. 
C. Experimental procedure 
Even before the first seminar, all test persons were 
familiarized with the gather.town environment. Especially the 
basic functions were tested, so that everybody knows them 
and can use them independently. In addition, the OLLES 
questionnaire was introduced, since this was used in its 
original language English, but the test persons were not native 
English speakers.  
There were a total of four measurement time points. The 
seminar duration was always from 8:15 am to 13:15 pm. From 
the start of the test, the seminar was always first held in the 
gather.town environment and at all four measurement times 
the entire questionnaire was completed online directly 
afterwards. 
D. Sample 
All data were collected at the University of Applied 
Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt within the seminar “trend 
analysis and innovation assessment” of the master study 
program “Innovation for small and medium Enterprises”. A 
total of 17 subjects participated in the study. However, there 
were not measured values from all subjects at all four 
measurement time points. From two subjects there were only 
three measured values and from four subjects there were only 
two measured values. This is still sufficient to form an 
arithmetic mean. Nevertheless, one subject was excluded from 
the final analysis because he produced outlier values on three 
dimensions. This leaves n = 16 valid subjects for the final 
analysis. The average age of the subjects is 24.44 years, with 
a minimum of 22 years and a maximum of 30 years. Of the n 
= 16 subjects, 7 are female and 9 are male. 
IV. RESULTS 
The first part of the evaluation is purely descriptive and 
refers exclusively to the mean values of the dimensions of the 
OLLES questionnaire, as well as the further questions on 
computer use and Internet use. 
In the case of computer use, it was found that all subjects 
use their computers daily or at least several times a week. In 
the case of Internet use, it was found that all subjects used the 
Internet on a daily basis. 
When tested for normal distribution with respect to the 
dimensions of the OLLES, Student Collaboration (SC), 
Computer Competence (CC), Active Learning (AL), Tutor 
Support (TS), Information Design and Appeal (IDA), Material 
Environment (ME), and Reflective Thinking (RT), all were 
found to be normally distributed. Those descriptive values can 
be seen in Table 1. 
In the second part of the evaluation, the Wilcoxon signed-
ranked test was used to examine whether there were 
differences between the individual measurement points and 
thus whether there was a change in the evaluation with regard 
to the repetition of the use of the gather.town environment. 
Since a normal distribution could not be determined for all 
variables, even after the exclusion of six subjects with partly 
missing values, the Wilcoxon test was used. Here, all 
requirements were met. 
There were only significant differences between 
measurement time point 3 and measurement time point 4 for 
the dimensions Student Collaboration (Exact Wilcoxon Test: 
z = -2.09, p = .037, n = 12) and Material Environment (Exact 
Wilcoxon Test: z = -2.41, p = .016, n = 12). Otherwise, there 
were no other significant differences between measurement 
time points.

V. DISCUSSION 
In the dimensions of computer use and Internet use, the 
subjects indicated that they use this on a daily basis. In 
addition, the gather.town environment and all basic functions 
were sufficiently explained before the start of the study. Thus, 
we assume that there were no poor ratings for the environment 
due to possible lack of technical skills. 
All dimensions of the OLLES questionnaire reach high to 
very high scores. From a purely descriptive point of view, it 
can therefore be assumed that the gather.town environment is 
holistically suitable as a learning environment in the tertiary 
sector. Nevertheless, the individual dimensions will be 
examined below. 
The Student Collaboration (SC) dimension asks in 
particular about the frequency of communication between 
students. This includes the question of help and feedback as 
well as the mutual exchange of information and resources. As 
already mentioned, studies have shown that collaboration [42] 
[45] [48] and communication [31] [48] have positive effects 
on users within a VLE. Therefore, this is an important factor 
for learning. It can be assumed that high values were achieved 
here in the evaluation, since gather.town provides enough 
possibilities, especially through the functions whiteboard, 
workshops, group discussion and informal encountering, that 
this can also be used profitably. 
The dimension Computer Competence (CC) asks in 
particular about the assessed competence of one's own 
computer and Internet use and also the ability to solve minor 
problems oneself. Since the highest values were achieved 
here, this further supports the assumption that all subjects had 
more than sufficient technical skills to use the gather.town 
environment to its full extent. 
The Active Learning (AL) dimension specifically asks 
about the motivation created, as well as the feedback received 
through the activities or the teaching unit within the 
environment itself. Again, various studies already showed that 
motivation [37] [39] [40] [42] [43] is a crucial factor in the use 
of VLE's. We assume that especially the varied design of the 
gather.town environment, but also the use of break rooms led 
to good scores on this dimension. 
The dimension Tutor Support (TS) asks in particular about 
the participation and accessibility of the tutor. In this respect, 
the response time to questions and feedback play an important 
role. Good communication [31] and interaction [48] lead to 
positively perceived VLEs. The second highest score was 
obtained for this dimension. This may be due to constant 
availability and timely communication, as the tutor himself 
was also always present and responsive within the 
environment. 
Therefore, 
from 
this 
perspective, 
the 
gather.town environment is well suited for interactive 
teaching. 
The dimension Information Design and Appeal (IDA) 
asks in particular how creative and original presented teaching 
materials are and whether graphics used are helpful and 
visually appealing. This mainly refers to the teaching slides 
presented as if they were in a presentation. Nevertheless, the 
colors and walking around within the environment can also 
have an impact on visual perception and lead to improved 
learning. In addition, there are the varied break rooms, so that 
there is also a fairly high rating here. 
The dimension Material Environment (ME) asks in 
particular about the installation process and clarity in using the 
software. Since very high values were also achieved here, this 
further supports the point that all test subjects had more than 
sufficient technical skills to use the gather.town environment 
to its full extent. In addition, it can also be assumed that the 
environment is easy to learn and therefore has a high practical 
value. In general, it can be assumed that VLEs must be 
accessible and not have too many hurdles to ensure a 
successful learning environment. 
The dimension Reflective Thinking (RT) asks in particular 
how well subjects were able to learn within the online 
environment, but also for a comparison to a real classroom. 
Since the scores here are also good, but lowest, it can be 
deduced that an online environment can be a sufficient 
substitute despite having sufficient features that are rated very 
positively in other dimensions, but real-world classrooms are 
still the most suitable form of teaching. 
Repeated measurement of user ratings of the gather.town 
environment showed that there was virtually no difference. 
Although a meta-study by Merchant et al. [12] found small

effects in simulation studies in terms of number of sessions, 
these were measures of learning outcome and not an 
assessment of the immersive environment as in this study. 
Therefore, it can be assumed that a one-time survey after the 
first unit or even after the last unit is quite sufficient. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
This study was exploratory in nature with the primary goal 
of seeing if an immersive 2D environment is holistically 
suitable for teaching in terms of presence, participation, 
collaboration, and active learning, and thus an enhancement 
over classic video transmission tools such as “zoom”, 
“GoToWebinar” or “Cisco Webex”, and the like. Thus, for 
now, only an overview of the use of an immersive 2D 
environment as a learning tool could be provided through this 
study. Group comparisons with other teaching formats could 
not yet be made. However, this is the next step in the research. 
For the next winter semester it is planned to complete the same 
lecture with a classical video conference tool and to run the 
same questionnaire. Afterwards a comparison of the two 
forms of teaching can be made. In addition, it seems to make 
sense to run another questionnaire in the form of the igroup 
presence questionnaire (IPQ) to see if there are differences in 
the sense of presence and how they affect the use. 
Furthermore, it was found that subsequent interviews may 
well provide additional important insights. In conversations 
with students, for example, we found that the gather.town 
environment was also used by students outside of the seminar 
to complete other group tasks. In further subsequent studies, 
I-VR environments can then also be tested in order to be able 
to make a comparison for this as well. At the moment, there 
are many indications that hybrid forms of teaching and 
learning will be used in the future.
