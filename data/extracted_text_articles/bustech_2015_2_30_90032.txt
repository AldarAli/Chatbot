Abstract—Although much has been discussed that cloud 
computing solutions provide a number of key benefits for 
enterprises which decide to apply it, however, there is a lack of 
a certain pattern, which could help enterprises to decide 
whether the architectural transformation to cloud computing 
solution will be economically viable. Mathematical calculations 
and various setting methods of identifying and calculating the 
costs of applying the cloud is becoming a new challenge. Owing 
to lack of investigative studies explaining the cost efficiency for 
business process transformation to cloud computing systems 
architecture to ensure the economic justification of the 
transition taken, this paper is to identify the costs of 
transformation to cloud computing systems architecture, 
outline cost efficiency method/s, and create a calculation and 
analytical tool that could be useful for enterprises and decision 
makers, and use it to assess if transformation to cloud solution 
was economically beneficial and cost efficient for Riga City 
Council.

 INTRODUCTION 
Cloud computing is the future of computing technology. 
Cloud development has a potential to completely change 
how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
companies render services to their customers by using 
technologies. ICT enterprises know that cloud computing is 
able to deliver ICT services efficiently and cost-effectively 
and has many advantages: easy implementation, qualified 
staff, and scalability, making internal resources available 
and enabling enterprises to improve the quality of their 
services. Cloud computing reduces the cost of ICT services 
and decrease processing time while increasing reliability, 
availability, processing capacity and flexibility [5]. 
According to different reports, the revenue from cloud 
computing is estimated in billions of euro and the global 
cloud computing market will reach €193 billion in 2020 
[1][7][13]. 
The challenge arises when making a decision about the 
suitability of cloud computing for enterprises that already 
have working and functional ICT systems. The enterprise 
must decide either to develop and invest in its own 
resources or to make changes based on consideration of the 
total costs or the environmental situation. 
The aim of this paper is to define the cost efficiency 
calculation and analysis method for business processes 
transformation to cloud computing systems architecture to 
ensure that the taken transition is cost efficient and what 
could be used as a tool in decision making.  
In the context of this article, the authors define the 
business process transformation as a gradual process of 
many stages and methods which allows executing the 
process in different environment. For example, if a business 
process runs in environment A, based on architecture X, 
these methods may be applied in certain order to allow the 
resulting process run in environment B, based on 
architecture Y. The transformation can be used to adapt 
desktop application to cloud infrastructure. By measuring 
how effectively alternative solutions can be used to solve a 
particular business issue and how an enterprise acquires 
most business and economic benefits for the lowest 
financial investment, cost efficiency ensures the economic 
justification of business process transformation. 
This is achieved by using a multi-method approach -
systematic literature review, analysis of cloud computing 
costs, comparison between calculation decisions, expert 
interviews and case study of Riga City Council has been 
used for the evaluation of cost efficiency method. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
and identifies the costs of cloud computing solution. Section 
III provides comparison of cost calculation methods and 
components for calculating the cost efficiency. Section IV 
provides the business case to assess if business processes 
transformation to cloud computing systems architecture was 
economically beneficial and cost efficient for Riga City 
Council. The acknowledgement and conclusions close the 
article. 
II. 
IDENTIFICATION OF COSTS 
A. Tangible Costs 
Any enterprise planning to adopt cloud computing 
solution initially has to define the costs of transformation to 
cloud computing architecture that are attributable to the 
specific case. They should be defined so one could perform 
appropriate calculations and evaluations. 
Many different ICT costs can be accounted: infrastructure 
and architecture exploration, evaluation of conformity, 
transformation costs, infrastructure changes and restoration 
costs, maintenance costs, hardware costs, software costs, 
human resources costs, personnel training costs, and other, 
although it is not possible nor needed to use all these costs 
in calculation. Costs should be measurable and comparable.

To identify the costs associated with cloud application 
efficiency and costs calculation cloud application phases 
and road map of cloud objectives and benefits should be 
defined. Violin [2] defines that cloud application life cycle 
consists of four key elements: (1) application strategy, (2) 
choice of supplier, (3) contracting and (4) management and 
governance. The Walterbusch et al. [15] defines similar life 
cycles: (1) initiation, (2) evaluation, (3) transition, (4) 
activity, and also adds a fifth element -final phase-(5) 
continuous monitoring of costs to be able to monitor the 
costs and risks, and move withdraws from the cloud 
services. Hexware Technologies [9] also defines four-step 
process if an organization wants to achieve cloud goals: (1) 
defining 
cloud 
strategy, 
(2) 
application, 
(3) 
ICT 
optimization or application migration, and (4) business 
innovation or creation of new business models. Willcocks et 
al. [13] indicates that the achievement of innovation with 
cloud resources is a two-stage process, which initially 
includes: (1) an enterprise cloud computing application, and 
then (2) innovating using those cloud resources. Enterprises 
will keep looking for ways to benefit from adoption of cloud 
computing although the benefit of innovations enabled by 
cloud computing may be larger [13]. 
This paper shows how to create cost efficiency model on 
the basis of cloud application life cycle and costs and 
benefits during this period, as well as add business 
innovations phase that will provide overview of benefits and 
costs in long-term. It defines the road map of cloud costs, 
objectives and benefits (Figure 1). 
 
Figure 1. Road map of cloud costs, objectives and benefits. 
1) Decision-making: 
This 
stage 
includes 
cost 
components such as time, consulting services and 
information for decision-making. This is a very important 
stage  in all of the cloud application life cycle since it entails 
the analysis of business needs and assessment on whether 
the possible cloud solution is suitable for the enterprise, its 
local infrastructure and technologies. It includes analysis of 
potential costs and benefits, as well as should include 
calculations. These are initial costs. 
2) Transformation: This is adaptation stage that 
includes 
infrastructure 
changes. 
It 
can 
be 
called 
implementation, configuration, integration and migration 
and covers costs of transmission and process factors. These 
also are initial costs. This stage also includes initial training 
that can be calculated by time for preparation of internal 
personnel and external consulting services, and other costs. 
3) Management: 
This 
stage 
includes 
ongoing 
maintenance, operation of cloud services, ICT support and 
ongoing personnel training. These are running costs. 
In order to reflect the full life cycle, the final closing stage 
also should be included, as it includes switch back from the 
cloud of suitable infrastructure. In this paper authors did not 
include this stage.  
4) Business innovations: These have to be evaluated in 
long-term. It also refers to the impact on the environment 
and socio-economic indicators and provides a range of 
evaluation factors that affect use of citizen’s e-services [1]. 
This phase includes intangible costs and benefits. 
B. Intangible Costs 
Besides the obvious costs of hardware, software and 
human resources, cloud solutions entail many other 
components. Costs that are not visible are always hard to 
measure. Nonetheless, they are one of the key factors in any 
analysis since they are just as important as other costs. 
Enterprises must understand these changes and chose 
reasonable cloud application strategies and contracts that 
can reduce risk by estimation of the Service Level 
Agreement (SLA). The following criteria are not imperative 
but they can generate extra costs that may, however, be 
avoided. 
If any of the activities are restricted or hindered, long-
term cloud benefits will be affected. Therefore, the 
understanding of the limitations on the cloud computing 
application is important, just like the factors preventing 
innovations when using cloud computing [13]. Risks like 
hidden costs must be considered since they can hurt the 
expected benefits [16]. It is highly recommendable to reduce 
the risks for enterprises intending to adopt cloud computing 
services with a meticulous cost analysis. It is also important 
to inform enterprises about the factors and various types of 
costs [15]. Ignoring these figures when making a decision, 
the enterprises may get to an outcome quite the opposite of 
the expected economic benefits [2]. 
1) Software 
adaptability: 
Interoperability 
and 
extensibility are very significant when transforming any 
new solution. Before any transformation it is important to 
find the answers to the following questions: how easy will 
the integration of the software be with other applications or 
is it going to be easy to adjust the application to enterprise’s 
needs. 
Without 
answers 
to 
these 
questions, 
the 
transformation to new solution will require much more time 
and money [10]. Each time enterprise modifies its software, 
it should remember that the initial relatively low expenses 
may lead to high costs of backfitting or maintenance. 
Improvement of an existing system or installation of the 
onsite system at the enterprise will more likely have to be 
replaced in five years. Replacement costs and the amount of 
the initial hardware investment will be alike, so it is better 
that these costs are planned. Additionally, after the five-year 
period customers may want to upgrade the software to the 
latest edition. The corporate acquisition of software in all 
areas may reveal the system upgrade costs. It may be 
39

important to make sure the adjustments remain unaffected if 
the system of the enterprise has been customized. In some 
cases, when users are added before the update, it might be 
necessary to purchase additional licenses. On the contrary, 
cloud improvements tend to be iterative, limiting the 
improvement in the costs of operation, which is the major 
reason why the total costs in terms of cloud and local 
systems differ around the five-year range [3]. Can the cloud 
application be adapted to the growth of local application 
development, is another point to consider [10]. There are 
some enterprises that want to install numerous cloud 
applications and integrate them to offer additional 
opportunities for their customers, but they might find that, 
for example, the integration between the two applications in 
the cloud is in no way possible [2]. 
2) Data handling and storage: Data handling and 
storage is one of the indicators with a couple of hidden 
costs. Data movement often raises costs; the price can be as 
high as €1 000.00. Cloud providers may require a fee for 
each download and long-term data storage in the cloud is 
expensive. Besides, an internally done backup copy of the 
data storage cloud is more expensive [2]. It might be 
necessary to buy new server hardware, and these costs may 
rise over time.  
After purchasing the cloud solution, one should plan for 
the same amount of server hardware investments. However, 
some may want to purchase a reserve server to support 
business data from the service provider [3]. Security and 
privacy policies are especially significant factors to any 
enterprise, that is why the following question should be 
answered - what kind of security and privacy policies are 
applicable to the cloud vendor, and how does it relate to 
internal policies [10][16]? 
3) Performance and quality: Performance and quality 
are certainly the benefits expected to improve with the cloud 
solution, although this benefit may bring up some hidden 
costs. SLA could be used to measure quality factors like 
reliability and availability. The type of guarantees and the 
risks of changing the technology matter if enterprises go for 
a cloud solution. Moreover, it is necessary to examine the 
data center and operations’ quality in each technology 
solution, as well as personnel involvement [10].  
The necessity to test the software before transformation to 
the cloud technology may also bring up hidden costs. 
Although using cloud configuration can be really cost-
efficient and save few hundred thousand euros, it may be 
necessary to stabilize the system [2]. With a cloud solution, 
the seller assumes the duty to provide software deployment 
and maintenance, also ensuring data security. The seller also 
determines how the enterprise limits its internal ICT costs, 
although it is not entirely avoidable because there will still 
be the need to manage the system configuration and local 
testing to ensure that application is running in the 
appropriate 
local 
ICT 
environment. 
ICT 
has 
an 
unpredictable nature and its issues makes it difficult to 
accurately identify and predict the amount of investment to 
ensure smooth work of the system, and the ways to manage 
ICT locally, which can significantly increase the total cost 
of ownership of the enterprise [3].  
Naturally, there are many costs related with the 
maintenance of the system of internal resources, but not all 
of them are covered from the ICT budget. With the arrival 
of the cloud, the basic infrastructure costs are included in 
the overall costs. In result, the enterprise has to pay for 
something (for example, electricity and rent) it was not 
charged before. Overall, cloud computing application 
provides lower costs, but requires overall budget changes 
[2].  
Every mathematical approach should apply restrictions 
that should be considered in the framework of the practical 
application thereby distancing from the cost types that are 
not applicable to the given situation [10]. Cost components 
of each individual situation will vary. Therefore, every case 
should be evaluated specifically. 
III. 
METHODS FOR CALCULATING THE COST EFFICIENCY 
Many studies illustrate and provide information on how 
the enterprises can benefit from cloud services, but only few 
enterprises have taken note of this beneficial effect before a 
final decision [15][17]. Despite the fact that most attention 
is paid to risks and safety issues, there are authors who have 
already begun to create new cost calculating models and 
methods. Most studies illustrate the economic benefits of 
cloud computing solutions for enterprises; however, a 
question arises - which method would be most appropriate 
for calculating cost efficiency and how cost efficiency 
should be measured?  
Frequently used cost calculation methods should be 
assessed: 
A. Return on Investment  
Return on Investment (ROI) is one of commonly used 
calculation method what estimates financial outcome of 
business investment and provides an assessment of how 
valuable will be a contribution [11][20]. It includes both the 
cost of investment (initial, running and closing costs) and 
the expected benefit from investment (tangible and 
intangible gains). 
Simple calculation formula for ROI is the following: 
𝑅𝑂𝐼 =
ሺ𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡  𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚  𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡  𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡  𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡
 
The result is expressed as a percentage or proportion. If 
ratio is greater than 0, it is expected that benefits are greater 
than costs, so that the investment can be regarded as 
beneficial [11]. Investment with the highest ROI is regarded 
as better business decision [14]. Obtaining a meaningful 
result depends on all the variables for calculating and 
defining a clear and consistent period of time [19]. For clear 
estimates, it is important to define clear and measurable 
benefits and easily known costs. It can be found that ROI 
calculation can be difficult and misleading for more specific 
investments, such as cloud computing systems and services 
[14][20]. Also, the usage of ROI calculation as the only 
40

BUSTECH 2015 : The Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Technology

financial measurement of decision making would not help to 
predict the feasibility of profit or the risks involved with a 
particular investment [11]. It is, therefore, necessary to look 
at other economic benefit calculations. 
B. Cost-Benefit Analysis 
Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is widely used calculation 
method what obtains the difference between costs and 
benefits to decide whether to make changes [14].  
To compare the benefits and costs of cloud computing, a 
number of variations of CBA can be used – Net Present 
Value (NPV), Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) and Internal Rate 
of Return (IRR). For example, NPV compares the expected 
benefits and costs of a predetermined time period through 
rate, which assists in calculating the present value of the 
future cash flows of transactions [8][11]. 
The formula to calculate simple NPV of the project is: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉 = σ
(𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑡 − 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 ) / ሺ1 + 𝑟 𝑡
𝑇
𝑡=1

 
Costs can be initial and regular, while benefits are mostly 
received over the time. The time effect is included in the 
analysis, in the calculation of payback period. This is the 
time it takes to change benefits for reimbursement of 
expenditure [14]. Benefits and costs are the future value at 
specified time t (number of periods from the beginning of 
the project); r is the discount rate, and t is the year. Also 
CBA evaluates each project and are defined as successful, if 
the calculated value is greater than 0 [11].  
Simplified cloud CBA would evaluate the economic 
benefits of cloud computing usage [14], but despite it allows 
comparisons to be made between investments, it may not be 
able to include all criteria which are deemed important in 
evaluation [8]. It is, therefore, necessary to look at another 
calculation. 
C. Total Costs of Ownership  
Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) is one of the most 
recognized calculation methods in assessing potential 
opportunities for business applications. It helps consumers 
and enterprise managers determine all the costs (direct and 
indirect; initial, running and closure) related to a product, 
service or system throughout its lifetime [14][20]. Basically, 
TCO is sum of all costs accounted during the life cycle of 
the solution [15]. 
The overall TCO can be calculated as: 
𝑇𝐶𝑂𝑇 = σ 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑐,𝑖
𝑡
= 𝑎𝑓,𝑖
𝑡 ∗ 𝑏𝑓
𝑡 
 
TCO calculation includes several cost categories t and 
components c in time period i. All costs are calculated using 
variables for consumed or necessary quantity αᵗf in period i 
with unit costs and prices bᵗf. It comprehensively considers 
the entire lifetime spending, capital costs, cost of operations 
and hence is suitable for base cost estimation [12][20]. 
It can be concluded that all calculation methods use the 
information of costs and are valuable tools for decision 
making. But, it is not possible to identify one for all needs 
of businesses.  
Advantages and disadvantages of each calculation method 
should be identified (Table 1). 
TABLE I.  
COMPARISION OF COST CALCULATION METHODS 
 
Advantages 
Disadvantages 
ROI 
- Information about expected 
savings [6]. 
- 
Great 
for 
clear 
and 
measurable expected benefits 
and easily known cost of 
investment [14][20].  
- Evaluates the benefits and 
costs of proposed alternatives 
[11]. 
- Calculates costs: return and 
investment costs (initial costs, 
running costs, closing costs), 
time, 
expected 
benefits 
[11][14][20]. 
- 
Difficult 
to 
use 
and 
misleading for more specific 
investments such as cloud 
[19]. 
- Looks at business benefits, 
which 
often 
cannot 
be 
measured as objectively as 
costs [18]. 
- Only one ROI calculation 
would not help to predict the 
feasibility of profit or the 
risks 
involved 
with 
a 
particular investment [11]. 
- Not very detailed, and thus 
may not be very accurate 
[14]. 
CBA 
- Information about earnings, 
expected benefits and costs of 
cloud computing usage of a 
predetermined time period 
through rate, which assists in 
calculating the present value 
of the future cash flows of 
transactions [11][14]. 
- Evaluates the difference 
between benefits and costs 
[6][12]. 
- Calculates costs:   initial and 
regular costs, benefits over 
the time, payback period 
(number of periods from the 
beginning of the project) 
[11][14]. 
- Not very detailed, and thus 
may not be very accurate 
[8][14]. 
- Does not include process 
changes and personnel costs 
or, for example, the benefits 
of mobility systems [14]. 
- Future benefits and costs 
are not measured [8]. 
- The chosen rate can 
radically change the results 
of analysis [8]. 
TCO 
- Very detailed and allows the 
assessment of all the costs 
throughout the lifetime of the 
system, service, process or 
product [12][14][15][20]. 
- Good to compare two or 
more alternatives [14]. 
- Provides a realistic and 
holistic measure of the long-
term costs required to acquire 
and 
operate 
technology 
solutions [18]. 
- Identifies hidden costs [4]. 
- Only one alternative TCO 
solution would not prove 
whether transformation to 
cloud is efficient, or not 
[10]. 
- Is not complete cost 
benefit analysis [4]. 
 
Disadvantage to point out of all previously compared 
calculation methods is that intangible costs are difficult to 
value. More sophisticated assessment approaches try to add 
financial value of the intangible costs. The same is about 
intangible benefits. For calculating costs of cloud computing 
solutions it is especially a challenge.  
ROI and CBA evaluate investments, but both look at 
business benefits what cannot be measured as accurately 
and objectively as costs. It can be seen that CBA and ROI 
make use of information about earnings and benefits and 
show how the solution is effective or ineffective. However, 
41

at the same time, the two estimates are not very detailed, 
and thus may not be very accurate.  
TCO can be used as most appropriate calculation method 
to compare two or more alternatives. It is very detailed, and 
allows the assessment of all the costs, including 
identification of hidden costs. But only one alternative TCO 
solution would not prove whether transformation to cloud is 
efficient and economically beneficial or not. 
Ideally, the enterprise will use several methods of 
financial indicators in decision, whether to transform the 
existing business process to cloud computing systems 
architecture, or improve the local architecture. For cost 
efficiency calculation most appropriate would be TCO, but 
it should be improved.  
The cloud cost efficiency model can be formed on the 
basis of cloud activity indicators – Key performance 
indicators [20], which are assessed as costs in each 
category: 
 
Time: 
It 
includes 
the 
time 
required 
for 
the 
implementation of the solution, as well as the 
availability period of the service. 
 
Costs: Costs are based on one or more of the method’s 
results described previously. This paper suggests that 
TCO is most appropriate as a base for comparing two or 
more alternatives and it allows calculating costs 
throughout the life cycle of solution. 
 
Margin: Profitability is the difference between cloud 
computing solutions and local infrastructure solutions. 
 
Quality: It includes performance and intangible costs.  
Cost efficiency method should be at hand to compare two 
alternatives (two alternative solutions - transformation to 
cloud solution and improvements of local architecture) for 
solution of one problem or business needs to calculate 
which alternative is economically beneficial and cost 
efficient.  
Rigorous cost efficiency calculation and analysis 
sequence of actions have been defined in Table 2.

The alternative is cost efficient if its realization during its 
life cycle requires the lowest investment. Cost efficiency 
analysis should include definition of business needs, 
evaluation and comparison of alternative solutions and final 
decision. Evaluation should include calculation and analysis 
of tangible and intangible costs. 
IV. 
COST EFFICIENCY BUSINESS CASE 
A. Business needs 
Common ICT solutions development and support for 
employees to provide fast and effective high quality services 
to clients is the main goal of Riga City Council concerning 
the ICT. Centralization in local authorities including 
Education, Culture and Sports Department subordinate 
institutions – schools was one of the biggest challenges for 
Riga City Council in the year 2011/2012. 
Municipality had to find a new ICT solution that could 
be appropriate for financial statements delivery to 
employees, ensuring the confidentiality of documents and 
electronic accessibility. There are more than 10 thousand 
school employees and pupils in schools of Riga City.  
It was necessary to decide whether to invest in its local 
infrastructure or transform to cloud solution. Potential 
benefits of cloud solution allowed make the decision, but 
whether it was cost efficient? 
In this case, it is not possible to perform the 
measurement of economic performance with existing 
solutions, because there was no solution at all. E-mail 
implementation was a new challenge for decision makers. 
Without a new e-mail solution, it would not be possible to 
provide the current technological opportunities. 
B. Evaluation 
1) Time: Transformation to the cloud as a whole took 
three months. Ad hoc solution would need at least six 
months. Usually enterprises for adopting cloud solution 
would need less time. When outsourcing data to the cloud, 
users and enterprises essentially lose control over their data, 
but Municipality has strong regulations and requirements on 
data handling and storage. Also acceptance of other 
decisions needed more time. 
Service accessibility time would be identical for both 
decisions. 
2) Costs  
a) Decision-making: Decision making costs include all 
involved specialist’s time, what is necessary for strategic 
decision, expenses of information upon which to base the 
decision and expenses of consultations.  
In example of Riga City Council, strategic decision 
took 16 work hours. Hourly rate of the decision-maker and 
the ICT personnel was 50€/h. Information materials were 
not used. The evaluation was conducted by an external 
consultant pricing at 70€/h and it took 40 hours. Decision 
making would require an identical time for both – 
improvements of local system and transformation to cloud 
computing system’s architecture. 
b) Transformation: Transformation costs of cloud 
computing 
approach 
demanded 
€50 000.00. 
Implementation, including the training, was carried out in 5 
days. Standardized transformation to cloud solution took 
less time than it would take if Municipality would improve 
its local architecture. The calculations do not include 
purchase of new hardware because it was not necessary.

c) Management: In evaluation of the management 
phase of business processes that is dependent on the service 
provider’s offer, the service availability is very important, 
and needs to be available 99.99% of time. These values can 
be provided only by a cloud service provider. 
In addition, cloud technology application reduces the 
capital and operation costs associated with servers, system 
licenses, system maintenance, data center and necessary 
support personnel. Maintenance is very important for 
service availability. Cloud computing approach requires 
only one day a year, which is 8 hours x €70 hourly rate of 
the service provider. For traditional enterprise software it 
would be €50 000.00, which includes servers and disk 
space, licensing and maintenance as well as additional 
required human resources. 
Access to e-mail is provided to 17 000 employees and 
30 000 pupils. Access price is set as part of annual 
maintenance. 
Closing costs were not included in the calculation. In 
both cases, it would be €56 000.00.

Table III reflects that costs of transformation to cloud 
computing architecture are lower - €103 160.00 compared to 
€156 000.00 if Municipality would decide to invest in 
developing its local architecture. It can be concluded that 
the transformation to the cloud solution has been cost 
beneficial. 
Figure 2 confirms that costs of transformation to chosen 
cloud solution was less than if improvements of local 
architecture would be implemented.  
Figure 2. Comparison of costs (five year perspective). 
Costs have to be assessed in at least five years 
perspective, to make sure that cost of two alternative 
solutions differences also in further years, since the first 
year involves investments in a new technological solution. 
The first year also involves the costs of decision making and 
transformation. Starting from the second year, these costs 
are not included. Growth of costs is assessed with a 15% 
inflation increase. Inflation rate shows the difference margin 
more effectively.  
d) Business innovations 
Business development: Faster response ability can 
improve service delivery, satisfaction and corporate 
relations of citizens, businesses, employees and suppliers.  
Redistribution 
of 
ICT 
operational 
activities 
offers 
enterprises 
the 
opportunity 
to 
focus 
on 
business 
development, including new and innovative applications 
that enable business and product development to provide 
better services. Cloud solution often causes creation of new 
solutions that were not technically and/or economically 
feasible without it [15]. Cloud computing can help to 
maintain or analyze large amounts of data disclosure and 
fraud. Thus, it can control corruption and improve e-
governance processes - application migration to any 
resident, lost data recovery, data copy establishment, 
pollution reduction, and other expenses [21]. Cloud 
computing can also help human recourses professionals to 
cope with various issues to ensure effective talent 
management, since it can help to solve the main problems of 
affordability, accessibility, timeliness, ease of use as well as 
integration. It also offers a technological solution with a 
potential of organic change that would happen in 
accordance with the enterprise’s own changing needs. 
Personnel have important role as from it depend decision 
whether transformation to cloud computing solution will be 
chosed and integration has been done correctly. 
Impact on the environment: As one of the quality 
indicators can be counted green and sustainability costs. 
Impact on the environment means savings from paper, 
energy and electricity. 
The e-mail cloud solution also used service that delivers 
documents electronically. As a result, there was no need for 
the printing of large amount of papers and transportation 
anymore. That is, since there are 17 000 employees 
receiving payment documentation every month, and, if the 
cost of one printout is €0.10, causing the costs of electricity, 
depreciation of equipment and tear, as well as petrol 
consumed in the process of delivering the payment 
documentation, it can be concluded that for Riga City 
Council it costs €1 700.00 monthly. That makes €20 400.00 
per year. In five-year’s perspective, savings are €102 000.00 
already. This is the whole amount if costs do not increase 
each subsequent year. 
This solution is an important factor in impact reduction 
of technologies to the environment (air conditioning, 
electricity, and other), that allows to achieve significant 
long-term goals.  
Impact on society: This cloud solution provides a 
number of key benefits, which affect not only the e-
governance areas but has an impact on society too.  
Every pupil and teacher is provided with a single e-mail 
address that can be used for professional purposes and 
provides a corporate image. Pupils may use this tool for 
sending documents, mutual communication projects, as well 
as for sharing documents. It saves their time and resources. 
On the other hand, by using this e-mail, teachers can send

transcripts to pupils – that is comfortable and safe. The 
Microsoft e-mail can be used as a tool for a variety of 
projects; it is possible to create groups and chat. It provides 
a quick and convenient use. It also ensures the reliability of 
the Municipality and sent documents. 
3) Margin: As shown in Table IV, in five-year 
perspective, estimating an inflation of 15%, cost difference 
between cloud solution and improvements of local 
architecture will be formed as €377 236.90 savings.

It should be noted that in five-year perspective, the 
ad hoc solution would need to include system upgrade costs. 
4) Quality 
a) Software adaptability: This solution has brought 
several intangible costs. The first was adaptability as it was 
necessary to integrate the application with Riga City 
Council’s local cloud solution and local systems. The first 
challenge was to create a mechanism that would find out 
how teachers and pupils are going to receive e-mail 
addresses and access them, and an identity maintenance was 
created for employees and pupils. This would also be 
necessary if the local infrastructure was developed.  
b) Data handling and storage: Microsoft changed the 
technological infrastructure standard from Live@EDU to 
Office365 one year later, so it was necessary to remake 
authentication solution as well as develop local systems. To 
ensure that the existing Office365 authentication temporary 
solution replacement and school infrastructure business 
continuity, authentication solution development demanded 
€54 000.00, but system development – €18 000.00. 
Unfortunately, a vendor may keep the rights to change its 
solution.  
c) Performance and quality: Quality also includes calls 
to errors or losses. Larger losses would be caused in the case 
of ad hoc improvements. It would go up to €200 000.00 
while the cloud solution is €50 000.00 which is €150 000.00 
less. 
C. Final decision 
Technology develops fast, and society develops along 
with it. At present, it is inconceivable that employees and 
pupils of Riga City Council would not have a uniform e-
mail system. Although they do not have to worry about the 
costs of the solution, indirectly this solution also reduces 
their costs – in terms of time and finance. Nowadays cloud 
computing is the ICT sector’s innovation around the world 
that provides immediate benefits but more importantly - the 
substantial long-term benefits. This solution is flexible 
because it is available on mobile devices, directly 
contributing to the development of the information society. 
Riga Municipality ICT architecture strategic direction is to 
move to a new ICT governance model for the 
implementation of a significant innovation, thus providing 
substantial economic and social benefits for its customers 
(citizens and employees). 
We conclude that business process transformation to 
cloud computing systems architecture was cost efficient, 
and provided analysis method for business processes 
transformation to cloud computing systems architecture can 
be useful as a tool in decision making. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
While cloud computing can provide clear benefits of total 
costs to any enterprise, which can be calculated by taking 
into account the TCO calculation method, it is crucial to 
take into account also the individual business requirements 
and hence the applicable components for each case 
individually. This can all be fixed in the decision-making 
phase.  
It is necessary to understand that some enterprises may 
require specific features or functionality that is not available 
as a cloud solution. It is necessary to assess whether the 
enterprise wishes to customize the solution to the basic 
level, something that is only possible in the local, on-site 
software model. There is a need to assess business 
requirements and then evaluate each vendor’s ability to 
meet this requirement. In the given example, the business 
cloud solution was available, and by calculation, as well as 
through business assessment, it can be concluded that the 
decision has been economically beneficial and efficient. 
Enterprises planning to use the cloud computing services 
are advised to thoroughly analyze costs to minimize risks 
and learn about all the cost types and factors. 
In order to select the most appropriate solution and 
decide whether to improve the existing architecture or to 
implement 
the 
cloud 
computing 
solutions, 
it 
is 
recommended to invest more in the decision-making stage 
(evaluation) - a process that enterprises often neglect and as 
a result it can lead to inadequate achievements. This is 
particularly important because every cloud solution varies 
depending on the components; it is suggested that the costs 
and benefits must be carefully considered over at least a 
five-year perspective, including intangible costs and 
benefits. Generally, enterprises can see that costs pay off in 
the second year already, as it is well presented in the given 
example. As technology develops approximately every five 
years, it is necessary to take into account that use of the 
ad hoc solution will require to invest in infrastructure and 
technological improvements. Those costs can be as much as 
the initial costs of the solution. That is why it would be 
useful to be aware of costs in more than a five-year 
perspective. However, if the enterprise has chosen the cloud 
solution, and especially outsourcing, it does not have to 
think about it. 
During the cost efficiency evaluation to determine 
whether the cloud computing is an economically beneficial 
and effective solution, other important factors also has to be 
assessed that are related to cloud innovation stage, which is 
associated with long-term and socio-economic factors.

After all, the purchase and implementation of the 
software is a business, not a technology decision. The type 
of technology that is chosen according to the business 
requirements of enterprises and organizations is different 
compared to the corporate business objectives, needs and 
risks the company is willing to admit. It is crucial to 
understand that each delivery model has advantages and 
disadvantages, both the financial and technological 
restrictions must be taken into account, as well as the 
specifics of the business.
