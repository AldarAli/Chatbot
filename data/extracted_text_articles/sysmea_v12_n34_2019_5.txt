Abstract‚ÄîWith the continuous evolution of society, the analysis 
of the quality of life of the population has become an 
increasingly complex process, for which it is necessary to 
evaluate not only the factors that measure the financial power 
and the degree of economic development of the region, but also 
of those through which it can be appreciated the integration of 
individuals in society and of their implication within the well-
functioning community. The importance of such an analysis is 
revealed from the implications of the insufficiency or even lack 
of measures to improve the standard of living has on members 
of society. Thus, as a result of the need of determining the living 
conditions, the implementation of the European Life Index 
Framework has been proposed. The Framework aims to 
automate the process of determining the quality of life of the 
population, data which the public authorities can use to easily 
determine the necessary steps for integrating disadvantaged 
people, reducing the poverty rate of the population, and 
improving quality of life. After analyzing the level of quality of 
life in European Union for the period 2007-2017, we have 
noticed that in the case of the former communist states, the 
quality of life standard is lower than that of the states which had 
a political trajectory outside the influence of the communist 
dictatorial regime. Also, due to the public policies mainly 
oriented towards citizens, the Nordic states have registered the 
highest values of the Quality of Life Index, surpassing even the 
countries of Continental Europe.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Measuring the population‚Äôs standard of living is an 
important instrument in determining the degree of 
development of a region, just as a high level of quality of life 
reflects both the well-being of individuals as members of 
society and the well-being of society as a whole [1]. 
Moreover, a high degree of satisfaction of individuals 
regarding the level of quality of life has an important 
influence not only on the increase of the well-being of the 
population, but also on the economy, by increasing the 
productivity of the work and the correct remuneration of the 
personnel, raising both public and private capital investments 
increasing the number of jobs and improving working 
conditions, as well as encouraging a healthy lifestyle 
approach. 
Although Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most 
used indicator of economic performance measurement [2][3], 
it cannot reflect by itself the population‚Äôs standard of living; 
measuring living standards being a complex process that 
must take into account not only the economic but also the 
social side. Therefore, for the most appropriate calculation of 
the Quality of Life Index (QoLI), it had been included not 
only dimensions that include economic and financial 
indicators, but also dimensions that reflect the degree of 
security of citizens, the ability of medical units to provide 
specialized medical assistance, the degree of development of 
the educational system, the integration of the population in 
the field of work, the level of relation of the individuals as 
well as other indicators that have a significant influence on 
both the economic and social welfare. 
The European Life Index Framework (eLIF) [4] is 
designed as a (semi) automatic QoLI calculation system, 
relieving specialists from identifying and applying complex 
sets of calculations. Thus, they have at their disposal a system 
whose task is to calculate the QoLI level from the perspective 
of eight objective dimensions and a subjective one, whilst the 
analysts only have to download the set of data regarding the 
outcome of the parliamentary elections provided by the 
International Institute for Democracy and Electoral 
Assistance (IDEA) and, of course, interpret the final result . 
The present case of study considers the analysis of the 
level of quality of life of the population in the European 
Union, for each individual Member State, over a period of 11 
years, starting with the year of Romania's accession to the 
European Union (2007), up to the last year for which 
statistical data are available for most of the analyzed 
indicators (2017). For a better understanding of the analysis 
context, we will make a brief presentation of the most 
important indicators of measurement of the level of 
development used over time, followed in Section III by a 
focus on the presentation of the nine economic and social 
dimensions used for the QoLI calculation. 
Further, in Section IV, the intent is to present both the data 
sets used in the calculation of the standard of living of the 
population and the sources from which the data were 
obtained, and then in Section V the topic ‚Äúquality 
assessment‚Äù will be approached. Thus, it will be performed 
an analysis of the data sets in order to identify the ‚Äúquality

issues‚Äù and the means used to correct them. Section VI is 
intended for the presentation of the architecture of the eLIF 
framework, where we will detail the calculation formulas 
applied both for determining the QoLI value and for 
determining the values of the dimensions that fall within its 
composition. Next, Section VII is intended to present the 
actual analysis of the standard of living of the European 
Union population for the 11 years analyzed, and the last 
section is reserved for exposing of a series of findings 
regarding the approached subject. 
II. 
 STATE OF ART 
The GDP is the most used indicator of economic 
performance measurement [2][3] in the intertemporal and 
interspatial comparison, expressing the balance of the total 
economy's production account as the sum of gross value 
added of the various institutional sectors and the various 
activity branched and taxes, from which are subtracted the 
subsidies on products, which are not allocated by the industry 
[5]. On a different note, as it can be observed in (1), the GDP 
is the economic indicator calculated from the perspective of 
the overall volume of consumption expenses, both from the 
governmental and the private area, of the governmental 
expenses, of the investments and of the trade balance. 
 
ùê∫ùê∑ùëÉ = C + Gov + I + Export ‚àí Import 
(1) 
C = The households‚Äô expenses; 
Gov = The central and local administration expenses; 
I = The value of the investments; 
Export = The sum of the expenses made by foreigners for 
goods and services produces in the country (exported); 
Import = The value of the expenses of the residents for goods 
and services produces outside their country (imported). 
 
From the financial point of view, the GDP reflects the 
economic development degree of an administrative-territorial 
unit for a given period of time, usually a semester or a year. 
Nevertheless, in comparative analysis, in its form, the GDP 
loses its accuracy because the ratio of the natural or legal 
persons which generates the GDP may enregister fluctuations 
even for the same analysed administrative-territorial unit. For 
this reason, its derivate, the GDP per capita, represents the 
standard instrument for this kind of analysis. Thus, the 
assessment of the GDP per capita may be interpreted as being 
not only an increase of the economic development level, but 
also an increase of the population‚Äôs life quality level from 
various perspectives, as follows: 
 
a) The increase of consumption may result both from 
the populations income increase, and from the 
applications of the governmental measures of 
stimulation of the consumption increase, increase 
which can influence the investments level and 
exports; 
b) The increase of governmental expenses fuels, most 
of the times, the turnover level of the private area; 
c) The increase of the level of the public and private 
investments may determine both the labour 
productivity assessment through re-technologization, 
through the increase of the employees‚Äô abilities, etc., 
and the assessment of the contractors‚Äô turnover;  
d) The assessment of the trade balance may influence 
the life quality level through the increase of the 
availability of capital, capital which can be 
reinvested or used for the employees and/or 
shareholders fidelity. 
 
Even though the GDP is an indicator often used in 
intertemporal and interspatial analysis regarding the degree 
of economic development, it cannot fully reflect the 
population‚Äôs standard of living. Thus, starting from the 
fundamental needs, specialists have identified a wider range 
of factors which have an important influence on the standard 
of living [6], that is: i) financial stability; ii) health and safety; 
iii) interpersonal relationships; iv) the individual role in 
society; v) personal development. 
Another metric for determining the development level of 
a certain region which has captured the attention of the politic 
decisions factors [7] has its origins in the year 1990, when 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched 
a new formula, by means of which the result is calculated by 
considering the factors which influence the richness of 
human life, and not the economy in which human beings live 
[8]. Thus, for determining the population‚Äôs standard of living, 
the indicator suggested by UNDP, the Human Development 
Index (HDI) [9], uses the following three dimensions 
fundamental for the human development [1]: 
 
a) the population‚Äôs health status and longevity; 
b) the level of knowledge the citizens have access to; 
c) the access to resources necessary for a decent 
standard of life.  
 
Even though for the modern man the financial part might 
represent a factor with a strong influence over the lifestyle 
adopted, in the HDI calculation, this factor does not have a 
greater significance than the other two. Therefore, as it can 
be observed in (2), the three factors which have a significant 
influence over the richness of human life are aggregated 
through the means of geographical average, a mathematic 
procedure which ensures the proportional distribution of the 
three factors. 
 
ùêªùê∑ùêº = ‚àöùêªùëíùëéùëôùë°‚Ñé ‚àó ùê∏ùëëùë¢ ‚àó ùêºùëõùëêùëúùëöùëí

(2)  
Health = The population‚Äôs health status and longevity; 
Edu = The level of knowledge the citizens have access to; 
Income = The level of financial resources to which the 
individual has access to for sustaining a decent standard 
of life; 
n = The total number of indicators taken into account (three 
indicators).

The acceptance of the multidimensional nature of the 
factors which have a significant influence over the life 
standard which an individual adopts has led to the emergence 
of a new metric, World Health Organization Quality of Life 
(WHOQOL) [10]. This new method of determining the 
population‚Äôs welfare, implemented by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) with the aim of identifying and 
protecting the vulnerable persons, takes into account more 
dimensions than HDI, that are: 
 
a) physical domain; 
b) psychological domain; 
c) level of independence; 
d) social relationships; 
e) environment; 
f) 
spirituality, religion, personal beliefs. 
 
For developing the WHOQOL 15 cultural centers from 
different countries have participated, which had the role of 
applying the set of questionnaires realized for this purpose to 
a sample of 300 people complying to the following structure: 
i) half the interviewed persons are aged under 45 and the 
other half are aged over 45; ii) half the sample of people are 
male and the other half are female; iii) 250 are persons with 
a disease or impairment and 50 ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù respondents. 
Finally, in order to analyze the variation between different 
domain predictors for the criterion of quality of life, a 
regression analysis has been performed [11]. 
Even though HDI and WHOQOL are two metrics of a 
great importance to be taken into account in the analysis for 
determining the level of economic development and 
population‚Äôs standard of life, the European Union‚Äôs 
Statistical Office (Eurostat) has suggested that, in official 
reporting, the measurement of the population‚Äôs welfare will 
be realized from the perspective of eight objective 
dimensions and one subjective dimension [12]. This set of 
dimensions, also known as ‚Äú8+1 dimensions‚Äù, being 
composed by the following: 
 
a) material and living conditions; 
b) productive or main activity; 
c) health; 
d) education; 
e) leisure and social interactions; 
f) 
economic and physical safety; 
g) governance and basic rights; 
h) natural and living environment; 
i) 
overall experience of life. 
 
As far as the sphere of ensuring the data quality is 
concerned, in literature [13][14][15], the following four main 
dimensions can be distinguished through which it can be 
ensured a level high as possible of the quality of data [1]: i) 
the data accuracy measures the degree of representativeness 
of the data stored in databases against the real world‚Äôs 
elements which they represent; ii) the data consistency refers 
to the data‚Äôs property of respecting the integrity constraints; 
iii) the information completeness measures the database‚Äôs 
capacity of providing complete information to the user‚Äôs 
query; iv) the data currency reflects the degree of the data‚Äôs 
actualization. 
III. 
QUALITY OF LIFE INDICATORS 
Even though GDP has been used for a long period as an 
intertemporal and interspatial comparison metric of the 
degree of economic development and the population‚Äôs life 
standard [2][3], this indicator offers results strictly from the 
financial 
perspective. 
Therefore, 
considering 
the 
measurement of the life quality transcends the financial 
aspect, for the calculation of the life standard, scientists have 
tried to identify and to take into consideration all factors 
which have an important influence [16]. Thus, starting from 
the financial aspect and up to the citizens‚Äô own opinion, 
Eurostat groups these factors in 8 dimensions relative to the 
functional capacities which citizens must have for a decent 
life standard, and a subjective dimension relative to 
individuals 
personnel 
perspective 
on 
the 
personal 
achievement of life satisfaction and well-being [12]. 
A. Material and Living Conditions 
Considering the complexity of life, the living standards 
are associated more like to the real income of the population 
and with the environment in which they live, rather than the 
GDP. Therefore, in order to measure these factors which 
influence the population‚Äôs standard of living, Eurostat 
proposes the use of the Material and Living Conditions 
(MLC) dimension, through which the level of living is 
reflected, not only from a financial perspective, but also from 
the point of view of the living conditions.  
If the financial aspect can be easily measured by reporting 
the purchase power of the population, through the 
determination of the median of incomes and through the 
identification of the inequality of income distribution 
(S80/S20 income quintile share ratio), determining the living 
conditions implies an analysis process of different factors 
which have a major influence of the individuals‚Äô social life. 
These factors reflect, on the one hand, the environment in 
which the analysed population lives, and on the other hand, 
the difficulty of satisfying the basic needs and of a decent 
living, as well as the individuals‚Äô capacity of sustaining the 
expenses necessary to enable them to have a decent living [1] 
(contracting mortgage loans, paying bills, purchasing long 
use goods, traveling inside and outside the frontiers, owning 
an automobile, etc.).  
B. Productive or Main Activity 
With the acceptance on wide scale of money as means of 
exchange, trading goods and services became a simpler 
process, and the individuals‚Äô attention was oriented towards 
developing and improving personal and professional skills. 
Therefore, in tandem with the society‚Äôs evolution, each 
individual must allocate a significant part of his/her personal 
time to provision of labour to ensure the financial source 
200

necessary both for sustaining everyday expenses and to 
engage in different social and professional activities. 
Productive or Main Activity (PMA) is a separate 
dimension, built both from the perspective of the quantity and 
of the quality of the employment, which envisages the 
identification of the effects the professional life has on 
individuals. From the point of view of the quantity, the 
unemployment and the long-term unemployment rate are two 
factors which have a significant influence in determining the 
population‚Äôs living standard because, as it has been related in 
the European Committee‚Äôs  Report [17], ‚Äúpeople who become 
unemployed report lower life-evaluations, even after 
controlling for their lower income, and with little adaptation 
over time; unemployed people also report a higher prevalence 
of various negative affects (sadness, stress and pain) and 
lower levels of positive ones (joy). These subjective measures 
suggest that the costs of unemployment exceed the income-
loss suffered by those who lose their jobs, reflecting the 
existence of non-pecuniary effects among the unemployed 
and of fears and anxieties generated by unemployment in the 
rest of society‚Äù. 
As far as the quality aspect is concerned, the PMA 
includes a series of entheogen indicators through which can 
be used to measure the benefits gained as a result of 
employment, the overqualification of the workforce, the 
equilibrium between professional and personal life (the 
number of working hours per week and the proportion of 
people working night shifts), the discrimination in the 
workplace, the safety at work. At the same time, besides the 
indicators which can be identified as being quantitative or 
qualitative, the PMA also includes two other factors found at 
the boundary between the two categories, involuntary 
temporary work and involuntary part-time employment. 
C. Health  
Health is a dimension which becomes more and more 
important with increasing age because the prevalence of the 
chronic diseases tends to increase as we age, by the increase 
of the life expectancy and the efficiency of the treatments 
against disease and conditions determine an increasingly 
stronger bound between the Health dimension and the 
determination of the population‚Äôs living standards level [18]. 
On the other hand, this dimension has also economic 
prevalence, not only in establishing the budget for prevention 
and population treatment actions, but also from the human 
resources perspective, which, if it does not have the capacity 
necessary for employment, it becomes from a supplier of  
added value in a beneficiary of treatment services.  
Being a complex dimension, more categories of factors 
are 
taken 
into 
consideration, 
beginning 
from 
the 
measurement of the healthy food consumption, up to 
determining the level of health infrastructure. Thus, 
embedded within this indicator, there are, in the one hand, the 
proportion of the population consuming daily fruits and 
vegetables, and on the other hand, the proportion of the 
population with unhealthy habits. Directly linked with these 
factors, there are both the life expectancy at birth and the 
health expectancy at birth, which measure the average 
number of years a new-born lives, respectively the average 
number of healthy years which a new-born lives, as well as 
the proportion of the population which is involved in physical 
activities and the effective healthy life, which measure the 
proportion of the population which considers to be in 
relatively good and very good health.  
Offsetting the indicators which measure the hope of life 
and healthy life of the population, there are the indicators 
which measure the proportion of the population which has a 
long-standing illness or health problem, the proportion of 
population which cannot afford to support health analysis 
(including the dental ones), the incidence of the occupational 
accidents which need medical recovery for more than 4 days, 
and the proportion of overweight population. As long as the 
infrastructure is concerned, the number of hospital beds per 
100,000 inhabitants and the proportion of medical personnel 
per 100,000 inhabitants represent veritable instruments to 
measure the capacity of the medical system to serve the 
population in the context of insuring the needed treatments. 
D. Education 
Education, as a dimension which describes the process of 
assimilation of knowledge and of improving the personal 
skills, represents the foundation of the human society, 
having, at the same time, a major impact upon the 
individuals‚Äô life quality [12]. Therefore, a solid level of 
education can favour the population in identifying and 
accessing some well-paid jobs, which contribute to the 
possibility of accessing high quality medical services and to 
the increase of living conditions.  Furthermore, the risk of 
social exclusion and the poverty level can be diminished, and 
the degree of the population‚Äôs implication in the public life, 
both as simple citizens and as political decision markers, may 
experience a favourable assessment.  
Despite the importance which this dimension plays in the 
individuals‚Äô life, from a scientific point of view, the 
measurement of the population‚Äôs educational level represents 
a complex process, and the mere reporting to the quantitative 
measure of years of schooling may not have the desired effect 
due to the fact that this indicator does not reflect the level of 
accumulated knowledge [19]. Thus, besides measuring the 
number of years which a student spent inside the education 
system, it is also necessary to analyse the factors which 
reflect the knowledge development and the cognitive skills. 
E. Leisure and Social Interactions 
If the time spent for the professional carrier development 
represent a sacrifice which each individual has to accept in 
order to beneficiate of a stable income source, the rest of the 
time is dedicated to household activities and recreative 
activities destined to improve the mental and physical health, 
to improve the self-esteem and self-confidence, to create 
social support and consolidating family bounds [20]. All 
these elements are found in the Leisure and Social 
201

Interactions  (LSI) dimension, dimension which has the role 
of determining the evolution of the self-esteem and the degree 
of participation of the individuals‚Äô in society with the help of 
two categories of indicators: i) indicators of measurement of 
the degree of the individuals‚Äô implication in society; ii) 
indicators referred to the personal bounding (family, friends, 
neighbours). 
Thus, the degree of participation of the individuals in 
cultural and sportive activities; the proportion of the 
population which do not participate at these activities due to 
financial considerations or lack of infrastructure; the degree 
of participation of the individuals in the volunteer activities, 
are all indicators through which it can be determined the 
degree of the individuals‚Äô involvement in society. As far as 
the second category is concerned, which envisages the 
estimation of the support which individuals can receive at 
need, there are used as calculation elements both the 
proportion of persons which have relatives, friends and 
neighbours on which to rely for moral, material and financial 
support, and the proportion of  persons which have at least a 
person with whom may discuss personal matters. 
F. Safety 
Safety is a state of stability both social and economic [1], 
which allows individuals to feel free of menaces and to 
concentrate on the personal and professional activities in 
which they are engaged. From a wide perspective, the Safety 
dimension envisages the measurement of the impact which 
safety risks to which the population is subject to on their 
welfare, being structured under the following criteria: i) 
economic safety; ii) physical safety.  
As the International Committee of The Red Cross defines 
it [21], the Economic Safety is reflected through the 
individuals, households or community‚Äôs capacity to cover 
with dignity the expenses generated by the satisfaction of the 
primary needs. In order to express these factors, in the 
Economic Safety calculation can be considered, on the one 
hand, the power of purchase of the retirees and the proportion 
from the GDP of the expenditure of social protection 
(administrative expenses only), which reflect the level of the 
income sources of the elderly persons and of the ones in 
exceptional 
situations 
(unemployed, 
persons 
with 
disabilities, families with low income etc.), and on the other 
hand, the proportion of the population incapable of coping 
with some unexpected financial expenses or in arrears.  
Physical Security is the component of the Safety 
dimension through which it is evaluated the level of 
protection of the individuals in front of crimes which may 
affect the physical and mental integrity of the victims or, 
through which the victims may be illegally dispossessed of 
personal goods. Such crimes which can be taken into account 
in the calculation of the physical security level are assaults, 
kidnaps, sexual violence, robberies and thefts, traffic and 
consumption of heavy drugs etc. 
G. Governance and Basic Rights 
Governance and Basic Rights (GBR) incorporates a series 
of factors which influence the level of the population life 
standard from the perspective of governance, regulation and 
guarantee of equal rights between the community‚Äôs 
individuals regardless of their health status, financial state, 
political, religious or cultural orientation. Therefore, for 
calculating this dimension, can be considered indicators such 
as employment gender gap and gender pay gap, which 
measure the existing differences on labour market between 
generations; the degree of trust the population has in the 
political and legal system and in Police; parliamentary voter 
turnout etc. 
H. Natural and Living Environment 
Pollution represent one of the world‚Äôs biggest problems 
due to the fact that its effects are increasingly felt, so that just 
for the year 2015 it has been estimated that 9 million cases of 
premature death (16% of all deaths worldwide) have been 
caused by the effects of pollution [22]. From air pollution 
cause by consumption of fossil fuel in industries and 
transportation area, to the pollution of the groundwater as a 
result of the toxic waste storage and to the acoustic pollution 
recorded in crowded cities, they all case harmful effects on 
the surrounding environment and on the population life 
standards.  
Thus, in a world ever more polluted, in which the effects 
of global worming are felt with an ever more increased 
intensity, the peoples‚Äô need and acknowledgement to protect 
the surrounding environment become a task ever more 
important both for the governmental institutions as well as for 
the nongovernmental organizations. For this, starting from 
determining the level of chemical and acoustic pollution up 
to determining the proportion of population which have 
access at least to one drinkable water source, the Natural and 
Living Environment (ENV) dimension represents a valuable 
instrument for determining the level of the quality of the 
surrounding environment in which individuals live and 
undergo their activities; results which the political decision 
factors may use to identity and applicate solutions aimed at 
conserving and improving the quality of the environment. 
I. Overall Experience of Life 
The statistical data are collected and prepared to serve as 
information and analysis resource both for political factors 
implied in the planification and evaluation of political 
decisions, as well as for private organizations and population 
which have the right to be informed regarding the evolution 
of the society they live in. Nevertheless, because no objective 
indicators can perfectly measure the described concept, in 
order to determine the population‚Äôs living standard, the 
subjective wellbeing measurement gains a particular 
importance due to the fact that through this dimension can be 
realised an overall image of the society groups which 
perceive the living standards as good or bad [23].

IV. 
OPEN DATA SOURCES 
In a world found in a continuous evolution, in which the 
speed of the information dissemination is at the distance of a 
click, and the population becomes more and more 
consciousness regarding the power of knowledge, ensuring 
the free access to data becomes a task ever more important 
for the worldwide institutions. Even though the term open 
data may imply that it defines those data which are not 
restricted in use, in their reuse and distribution, some 
suppliers might have different perspective regarding what 
openness represents [24]. Thus, even though the access to 
data is free of charge, the actions of use, reuse, reworking, 
redistribution and reselling might be limited or restricted 
through the terms and conditions imposed by the data 
suppliers [1]. 
In the governmental area, the Open Government Data 
initiatives started to fall into place, so that ever more states 
supply data with free access for users. Nevertheless, even 
though each state has its own rules and priorities of data 
publication, the existence of some aggregators as Eurostat 
facilitates the access of interested persons to sets of public 
data. Thus, Eurostat make available both a user-friendly 
interface, as well as an API Server [25], through which the 
process of obtaining the sets of data can be automated.  
For obtaining the data relative to the 8+1 analysed 
dimensions, the programmatic interface made available by 
Erostat has been used, so that the analysis can be easily be 
extended for any desired period of time. At the same time, 
due to the fact that the data relative to the parliamentary voter 
turnout is not available in the Eurostat statistics, these data 
have been obtained from reliable suppliers as the 
International Institute for Democracy and Electoral 
Assistance (IDEA) [26]. The name of all of these data sets 
can be seen in Table I, where we summarized them in order 
to make available to the audience the used indicators.

OPEN DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT 
In the literature, the concept of data quality is referred to 
as an indicator by which data utility can be measured from 
the perspective of data consumers [27][28], a broad term used 
to describe this concept being ‚Äúfitness for use‚Äù [27][29][30]. 
At the core of the process of measuring the quality of the data 
are the data producers and the data custodians, whose role is 
to generate the data, respectively storage them, to ensure the 
203

maintenance and the security of the data, so as the data 
customers can use them in the provided form or after 
applying some processes of data aggregation, and data 
integration [28]. 
Starting from the significance of the open data concept, 
we can deduce that open data quality is part of the concept of 
data quality that concerns the data with free access for use, 
regardless of the type of license under which they are 
provided [1]. Regarding the practical way of measuring the 
quality of open data, the most widespread dimensions in the 
literature are accuracy, completeness, consistency and 
timeliness [13][28][31]. 
A. Data Currency Issue 
Data currency or timeliness is an indicator of measuring 
the quality of the data used to determine the degree of the 
currency of data in relation to the specific activity for which 
they are used [15]. As in the case of the API provided by the 
National Institute of Statistics of Romania, the API provided 
by Eurostat presents the same deficiency: the update date is 
available for the data set as entities and not for records from 
data sets [1]. Therefore, although we may have a reference 
regarding when to update the data sets, we cannot identify 
whether they have been modified as a result of adding new 
records or as a result of updating existing records. 
B. Data Inconsistency 
The inconsistency of the data can be defined as the lack 
of data consistency, meaning that state of the data in which 
the format and value are not in accordance with the chosen 
data model [32] or which have discontinuities [1]. In the case 
of the current analysis, the inconsistency of the data is 
materialized both by the discontinuity in time of the data sets, 
and by their different format, Eurostat offering a flexible API 
Server that returns the data sets using the JSON-stat standard 
[33], while IDEA offers the possibility to export data on the 
results of parliamentary elections in ‚Äúxls‚Äù format. Thus, as 
can be seen in Table II, the share of missing data is slightly 
over 31%, a result determined primarily by the presence of 
indicators for which data is available only for one year. 
For example, in the case of the Overall Experience of Life 
dimension, which has a single indicator - the High 
Satisfaction Rate, the total number of values expected to be 
present in a data set without discontinuities is 308 
(28 ùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë°ùëüùëñùëíùë† ‚àó 11 ùë¶ùëíùëéùëüùë†). However, because values are 
available only for the year 2013, the share of missing data is 
very high, reaching about 91% L
MN OPQRSTUVW ‚àó XY ZV[TW
MN OPQRSTUVW ‚àó XX ZV[TW ‚àó 100] 
of the total data. For other data sets, the periods with 
discontinuities may be shorter, but the lack of data even for a 
single year for a state prevents us from determining the QoLI 
value for that particular state. 
Therefore, to correct the data discontinuity, the present 
study proposes that the value for missing years be 
supplemented with the value of the previous year, and if for 
any previous year there is no value, the value of the following 
year will be assigned. The advantage of using this approach 
instead of calculating the average of the series [1] is that the 
value thus calculated is closer to ‚Äútruth‚Äù, that is, the average 
of the series can be much higher or much lower compared to 
the fluctuation of the values from one year to the following.

As for the format of the data sets, if in the case of those 
provided by Eurostat a standard format is used which allows 
quickly querying and processing of data, the same cannot be 
said about the data set provided by IDEA. The latter is saved 
in ‚Äúxls‚Äù format, having all data stored in string type columns. 
Moreover, the percentage data is presented as a numerical 
value followed by the percentage sign ‚Äú%‚Äù, which requires 
that, before converting to numerical format, a cleaning 
operation of the values is performed so that they can be used 
in mathematical operations. 
C. Lack of Data 
Determining the level of quality of life of the population 
involves the study of economic, financial and social 
phenomena and processes in which individuals are engaged 
and which influences their lives. To this end, identifying 
official sources and data sets which reflect the factors of 
influence is the first step in conducting such an analysis. 
Unfortunately, although Eurostat provides a wide range of 
data sets from different fields of activity and areas of interest, 
some data sets are not complete, making it impossible to 
perform a comparative analysis in time and space. 
By incomplete data sets are defined the ones for which 
data from at least one country is missing for the entire 
analyzed period of time (2007-2017). Thus, considering the 
principle listed in the previous subsection regarding the 
completion, in Table III we find name of data sets that were 
completely excluded from the QoLI calculation.

VI. 
THE FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE 
Determining the level of quality of life of the population 
is a complex process which, due to the impact it can have in 
determining and applying social and economic policies, has 
attracted the attention of more and more researchers. Having 
as a starting point a series of indicators that, over time, have 
gained visibility in this direction, the eLIF [4] has been 
developed to provide specialists with a complex (semi) 
automatic solution for calculating Quality of Life Index from 
the perspective of 8 objective dimensions and a subjective 
one. Thus, the persons interested in carrying out analyzes 
regarding the state of living of the population are relieved 
from identifying and implementing the QoLI calculation 
formulas; the only tasks being to download the data set 
regarding the outcome of the parliamentary elections 
provided by IDEA and to interpret the obtained results. 
Regarding the design architecture of the eLIF framework, 
as can be seen from Figure 1, the architecture is conceived in 
four steps: i) data preprocessing; ii) calculating the values of 
the QoLI dimensions; iii) preliminary analysis of the result; 
iv) presentation of the result. 
Data processing, as a preliminary step in calculating 
QoLI dimensions, it begins by identifying official sources 
and data sets that reflect the main factors that influences the 
quality of life. Based on both the sources and the data sets, as 
well as the analysis carried out in the previous sections, the 
following step is to trace the 8+1 dimensions that have a 
major influence on the quality of life of the population, and 
then the attention is focused on identifying and implementing 
the data structure on which the subsequent calculations will 
be performed.

Before performing the actual calculations, an important 
step for any analysis is data preparation, that is to say 
processing them to meet the own needs. This process 
involves both performing various corrections on the data 
(cleaning the data, converting the numerical values into 
percentage values, consolidating several indicators into one 
etc.), as well as filling in the missing data with a replacement 
value using the approach presented in the previous section. 
 
 
Figure 1.  The framework architecture.  
However, if during this process it is found that the data 
structure no longer corresponds to the practical reality, the 
procedure returns to the (re)design stage of the data structure, 
and later (re)processing. Subsequently, after processing the 
data extracted from the official sources, we proceed to 
calculating the values of the 8+1 QoLI dimensions, a stage in 
which the formulas for calculating the dimensions reach the 
final form and are applied to the processed data in order to 
generate the analysis data. 
The third stage, preliminary data analysis, is an 
intermediate stage for presenting the final result, with the 
purpose of identifying potential errors and discrepancies in 
the process of calculating the indicators [1]. For example, 
End Meet Inability Rate, Material Deprivation Rate, 
Unemployment Rate, Unmet Dental / Medical Rate, School 
Dropout Rate etc. are indicators which have a negative 
influence on the calculation of the dimensions they belong to, 
which requires in the final formula the use of synthetic 
indicators that determine the weight of the population that is 
not affected (R - Reversed Rate), using the calculation 
formula set out in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Function for getting the Reversed Rate. 
Thus, after correcting the values of the indicators that have a 
significant influence in determining the level of quality of 
life, the flow of operations returns to the processing of the 
data to recalculate the final values of the QoLI dimensions. 
Finally, the last stage, displaying of results, allows users to 
extract the final result broken down by countries and years 
both for the generic QoLI indicator and for the dimensions

that compose it. The actual calculation of these values is 
performed by applying the logarithmic function to the 
product of the indicators / dimensions related to the measured 
metric as in (3).

(3) 
p = The product of dimensions/indicators. 
 
In the case of QoLI, the value is calculated as a result of 
applying the logarithmic function previously presented over 
the product of all the dimensions that compose it as in (4).

Health = Health dimension; 
Education = Education dimension; 
LSI = Leisure and Social Interactions dimension; 
Safety = Safety dimension; 
Environment = Natural and Living Environment dimension; 
Overall Exp = Overall Experience of Life dimension. 
 
The use of the logarithmic function for the calculation of 
the final result is required by the asymmetrical character of 
the dimensions that belong to QoLI, respectively of the 
indicators that belong to the composition of the QoLI 
dimensions, so that it can be avoided the case when a low 
value indicator has to be compensated by another high value 
indicator [1]. After a closer analysis, in contrast to the paper 
[1], in which, for the calculation of the indicators, it has been 
chosen to extract the root of the order n, we considered that 
the logarithmic function is a truer instrument because, as J. 
Martin Bland and Douglas G Altman acknowledge [34], data 
transformation through logarithmic function offers the most 
interpretable results even after applying the anti-log function 
to cancel the logarithmic calculation result. Thus, using the 
logarithmic function to calculate the QoLI result we assure 
that a 1% change in one dimension will have the same impact 
as the 1% change in any other dimension. 
A. Material and Living Conditions 
MLC is one of the most complex dimensions taken into 
account when determining the level of quality of life of the 
population, because, besides determining the financial 
conditions of the population, through this dimension, the 
level of living conditions of the population can also be 
determined. In order to determine the MLC value, the 
calculation of the product of all the indicators related to this 
dimension is considered as in (5), followed by the application 
of the logarithmic function over this product.

B. Productive or Main Activity 
As a dimension that measures the quality of life from the 
perspective of the professional side of individuals, Productive 
or Main Activity includes a series of indicators regarding the 
worked hours, the type of the accepted work contracts and the 
share of the unemployed population. Thus, for the calculation 
of this dimension, the logarithmic formula will be applied to 
the product of the indicators found in the PMA composition 
as presented in (5), with the mention that the Average Work 
Hours (AWH) indicator will be processed to determine the 
weight of the number of hours worked at every 12 hours per 
day over a week according to (6).

Unemp Rate = Percentage of labour force aged 15-74 years 
who are unemployed (%). 
C. Health 
Health is one of the dimensions that has always been a 
reference for the scientific world in the process of 
determining the standard of living of the population, carrying 
out a wide range of analysis of the implication of the level of 
health on the respondents [35][36][37]. As can be seen in (7), 
for the current analysis we considered a series of factors that 
have an important influence on the population both from the 
perspective of the health system's ability to provide 
specialized healthcare as well as the perspective of the 
population to adopt a healthy lifestyle. 
Thus, there can be identified both indicators that measure 
the lifestyle of the population (Fruits and Vegetables 
Consumption Rate, Obese Population Rate, Smokers Rate) as 
well as indicators that show the access of the population to 
health services (Health Personnel, Hospital Beds) and that 
estimate the expectations regarding the level of health of the 
respondents (Healthy Life Rate, Life Expectancy, Work 
Accidents, etc.).

D. Education 
Even if the short-term impact within the Education 
dimension is not no visible, as a primary factor in the 
development of both society as a whole and of individuals in 
private, this dimension has a significant influence on 
establishing the standard of quality of life. Thus, in the long 
term, through a solid education system, which takes into 
account both group and individual needs, the influence of 
education can be reflected both by the development of the 
individual character of the population and by the good 
training of professionals; whom can then be integrated more 
easily into the field of work. As in the calculation formulas 
of the other dimensions, Education is calculated by applying 
the logarithmic function presented in (3) to the product of the 
indicators specific to this dimension as presented in (8).

years) who are participating in education and training in 
the last 4 weeks (%); 
NKFL Rate = The share of people (from 25 to 64 years) who 
don't know any foreign language (self-reported). 
E. Leisure and Social Interactions 
As the leisure time is related to social activities, in 
calculating this dimension are taken into consideration both 
the indicators that reflect the moral support that the 
population can receive from close persons, and the indicators 
by which the social activity of the individuals is reflected.

Thus, the general calculation formula presented in (3) applies 
over the product of all these indicators as in (9).

voluntary activities (%). 
F. Safety 
The Safety dimension is of particular importance because 
it can determine the degree of safety of the population, both 
physically and financially. Therefore, for the calculation of 
this dimension, the product of the indicators that compose it 
will be used as in (10), with the mention that the indicators 
Pension Power and Social Protection Power will be corrected 
by dividing them by 100 as in (11).

Crime Rate = The share of the population who perceived 
there was crime, violence or vandalism in the area 
where they live (%); 
Pension Power = The average pension (Purchasing Power 
Standard per inhabitant); 
Social Protection Power = Social protection expenditure 
(Purchasing Power Standard per inhabitant); 
Unexpected Rate = The share of the population unable to face 
unexpected financial expenses (%); 
Non Payment Rate = The share of the population in arrears 
on mortgage or rent, utility bills or hire purchase (%); 
Offences Rate = Recorded offences (assault, robbery, sexual 
offences, theft, unlawful offences) per thousand 
inhabitants. 
G. Natural and Living Environment 
Natural and Living Environment is the only one 
dimension that, for calculating the Quality of Life Index, 
takes into account indicators through which the state of the 
surrounding environment is reflected. Although green space 
per capita is an important indicator for measuring the mental 
health of individuals [38][39], in the absence of an official 
data set, two other indicators that measure the quality of the 
environment will be taken into consideration, namely: noise 
pollution, and respectively pollution. In order to determine 
the quality index of the environment, the aggregation of these 
indicators is performed in a similar way to the aggregation of 
the other dimensions‚Äô indicators, by applying the logarithmic 
function over the product of the related indicators as in (12). 
ùëù = 
ùëÖ(ùëÅùëúùëñùë†ùëí ùëÉùëúùëôùëôùë¢ùë°ùëñùëúùëõ ùëÖùëéùë°ùëí) ‚àó

(12) 
Noise Pollution Rate = Share of population reporting noise 
from neighbours or from the street (%); 
Pollution Rate = Share of population exposed to Pollution, 
grime or other environmental problems (%). 
H. Overall Experience of Life 
Unlike the other eight statistical dimensions of measuring 
the quality of life from the perspective of the objective 
functional capacities of individuals, the Overall Experience 
is the only dimension that takes into account people's choices, 
priorities and values [12]. Thus, the calculation of this 
dimension is done by means of a single indicator that 
measures the proportion of the population that experiences a 
high quality of life level, as in (13). 
ùëÇùë£ùëíùëüùëéùëô ùê∏ùë•ùëù = ln(ùêªùëñùëî‚Ñé ùëÜùëéùë°ùëñùë†ùëìùëéùëêùë°ùëñùëúùëõ ùëÖùëéùë°ùëí) 
(13) 
High Satisfaction Rate = Share of population rating their 
overall life satisfaction as high (%). 
VII. 
DATA USAGE 
Estimating the level of quality of life is a complex process 
that involves monitoring not only of the economic, financial 
and environmental indicators through which the economic 
development and financial power of the population is 
reflected, but also the social indicators which reflect the 
degree of interrelationship of individuals in society. The 
importance of estimating this indicator stands in the very 
dimensions that come within its composition, being useful 
both to the government decision makers who have the legal 
levers for combating poverty and raising the standard of 
living of the population, as well as the other actors in the 
208

society interested in following the annual evolution of the 
degree of economic and social development of the European 
Union Member States [1]. 
The present analysis aims to determine the level of quality 
of life of the population of European Union, starting with 
2007, the year of Romania's accession to the European 
Union, until 2017, the last year for which statistical data are 
available for most of the analyzed indicators. Thus, we 
envisage the production of statistics that provide the 
interested parties with data on both top Member States that 
record a considerable advance and those with a lower level of 
quality of life in comparison with the other Member States. 
Given that the final result of the study materializes into a 
comparative analysis of the quality of life for the 28 European 
Union Member States, for a period of 11 years (2007-2017), 
the final result of the data processing will be presented both 
in table form, through Table IV and in visual form, through 
Figure 3 and Figure 4. As it can be seen, the result of the 
calculation for determining the quality of life of the 
population can be divided into two sections, depending on the 
political ideology on which the states were governed before 
the 1990s. Thus, in the former communist states (Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Cyprus, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary) as well as in 
four other states outside the sphere of influence of the 
communist regime (Greece, Malta , Portugal, Spain) a low 
level of quality of life of the population can be identified; 
most of the states that did not have a significant influence of 
the communist doctrine, registering a high level of quality of 
life of the population throughout the analyzed period of time. 
One of the pillars of a modern society that has a 
significant influence on both the personal as well as on the 
professional life of individuals, is education, because, 
through continuous learning and improvement of their 
abilities, the members of society can more easily develop and 
benefit from interpersonal relationships and they can achieve 
better results in the field in which they operate. 
Unfortunately, although, theoretically, the early integration 
of children in the education system should enable them to 
develop their personal capacities and abilities, in practice, the 
quality of the education system has a determining influence. 
In this regard we can see that for the analysed period, 
although in Bulgaria and Romania the share of pupils aged 
between 4 years old and the starting age of compulsory 
education does not register values lower than 83%, in 
Finland, country where one of the best education systems in 
the world is found [40][41][42], this indicator starts below 
70%, exceeding the 80% threshold only starting with 2012. 
At the same time, the participation rate of the adult population 
(adults between the ages of 25 and 64) in training courses 
reaches, in the Scandinavian countries, even over 30%, 
whereas, in the vast majority of the former communist states, 
this indicator does not even reach the 10% limit; in Bulgaria 
and Romania are registered the lowest values in the whole 
European Union, with values below the 3% threshold. 
As in any economy, the quality of the education system is 
directly reflected through the level of purchasing power of 
individuals, more precisely, through the level of income in 
relation to their own needs; the population with a higher level 
of qualification can register a higher value of the 
remuneration of the work performed and, implicitly, the 
value of the future retirement pension will be higher. Thus, 
regarding the financial security of the population, we can see 
that, in the countries of the former communist bloc, both the 
purchasing power of the population and the general capacity 
of individuals to deal with unexpected expenses, register 
lower values than the countries in which the influence of the 
communist regime was not so great. Similar trends are also 
identified in other indicators that measure the financial 
stability and living conditions of the population such as 
inequality of income distribution (S80/S20 income quintile 
share ratio), severe material deprivation rate, share of people 
living in over-occupied dwellings, etc. 
As regards health, a particular situation is encountered in 
the case of Bulgaria and Romania, in the meaning that, 
although in these two countries the level of life expectancy at 
birth indicator has some of the lowest values in the whole 
European Union unlike the countries outside the former 
communist bloc that registered the highest values, regarding 
the share of people (aged 16 years or over) having a long-
standing illness or health problem, the situation is completely 
different, in the meaning that in Bulgaria and Romania have 
been registered the lowest share of the population with long-
standing illness or health problem, being followed just a few 
places away by Denmark, while Finland is the country of the 
European Union where the highest proportion of such cases 
has been reported. Therefore, although the lowest life 
expectancy registered in the European Union is in Bulgaria 
and Romania, the resident population lives most of their lives 
without serious health problems and without incurable or 
very difficult to treat diseases, while, in Finland, one of the 
most developed countries, the population often faces such 
problems throughout their lives. 
However, it should be noted that although the two 
countries at the end of the QoLI ranking have the lowest share 
of people suffering from serious illnesses, at the same time 
have the highest share of population who, for financial 
reasons or related to the distance at which the medical units 
are located, cannot benefit from the specialized treatment. 
This phenomenon is prevalent in the former communist 
countries that had a different trajectory of economic and 
social development compared to the western countries. 
Neither with regard to the active involvement of 
population in the life of society, the countries of the former 
communist bloc do not register exemplary values, since in 
most of these states the level of involvement is below 17%. 
In Romania and Bulgaria have being registered the lowest 
rates, 3.2%, respectively 5.2%, while in developed countries 
the share of the population involved in volunteering activities 
can reach just over 30%, and in Scandinavian countries, even 
up to almost 40%. A similar statistic is also reflected in the 
209
International Journal on Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 12 no 3 & 4, year 2019, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/
2019, ¬© Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

share of the population engaged in cultural or sporting 
activities. From this perspective, Romania and Bulgaria are 
also on the last two places, with values below the 30% 
threshold (Bulgaria rising to 31.9% in 2015), while most of 
the other former communist states registering values between 
40% and 70%. On the other side, the countries where the 
influence of the communist doctrine did not have such an 
important impact, the share of the population participating in 
various cultural and sporting activities exceeds 70%, the top 
being occupied by the Scandinavian countries with values of 
over 80% registered over the whole time period taken into 
consideration. 
Analysing the trends that the indicators that make up the 
QoLI ranking registered during 2007-2017, we can notice 
that the European Union is divided into three important 
groups divided according to the economic and social 
evolution of each country. The first group is made up of the 
majority of the former communist states that, in the process 
of transition from a dictatorial regime to an open regime, have 
faced various specific challenges such as guaranteeing and 
protecting the rights, destructuring of oppressive institutions, 
liberalizing the market, strengthening relations with The 
West, attracting foreign capital, etc. Thus, as can be seen in 
Figure 4, the last places are occupied by Bulgaria and 
Romania, which, for the entire analyzed period, maintained 
their last places (28th and respectively 27th), followed by 
Latvia, which until 2011 ranked 26th. After 2012, against the 
background of applying the limiting measures of the negative 
effects of the public debt crisis (freezing wages and 
eliminating bonuses in the public sector; raising and 
introducing new taxes; reducing salaries and pensions, etc.) 
[43], Greece was to record a significant decrease in the 
quality of life, bringing the country to the 26th place, while 
Latvia was to rise of one place, occupying the 25th at the end 
of the analyzed period. 
The second largest group is mainly made up of Western 
countries, which have always had a trajectory oriented 
towards freedom. Although they are not in the top of the 
ranking, the experience of a lasting democracy serves as a 
support for a stronger economy, thus, the success of these 
countries may be determined by several public policies 
implemented over time, of which we list the following [44]: 
 
‚Ä¢ 
reducing variations and conditions for granting different 
levels of social protection such as unemployment 
benefit, social assistance etc.; 
‚Ä¢ 
orientation towards programs for induction within the 
field of work of young people, women and workers with 
limited abilities; 
‚Ä¢ 
emphasizing on policies for balancing professional and 
personal life. 
 
Finally, the podium is occupied by the Nordic countries 
(Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway - which is not a 
member of the European Union) which have always had a 
very high quality of life compared to other European 
countries due to their ability to quickly adapt to new political, 
economic and social changes. The Nordic model of 
development can be characterized from the perspective of the 
following three key features [45]: 
 
‚Ä¢ 
stateness: the Nordic political classes understand better 
than the other European countries that the state does not 
have to be an oppressive apparatus; 
‚Ä¢ 
universalism: financial services and benefits are not only 
aimed at the needy, but also extend to the middle class; 
‚Ä¢ 
equality: equal opportunities are one of the values that 
the Nordics emphasize upon, thus, the Nordic countries 
have a high level of gender equality. 
 
In the end, based on the evolution of the QoLI indicator 
of the states at the end of the ranking presented in Figure 4, 
we can see that they are registering an upward trend, with the 
exception of Greece, which, due to the public debt crisis, was 
forced to apply a series of austerity measures so as to avoid a 
potential bankruptcy of the whole country. Continuing at this 
rate, with the help of both the expertise of the developed 
countries and with the free sources of funding that the 
European Union offers to the Member States in order to cover 
the development gaps between regions (European funds), the 
less developed countries have the chance to quickly recover 
some of this gap. However, even if from 2013 the growth rate 
has become more and more rapid, for a solid development, 
these states must rethink the long-term development strategy, 
taking Poland as example, a country which has managed to 
become an important industrial center in Central and Eastern 
Europe, and Finland which made every effort to restructure 
the education system starting from the Swedish model. 
On the other side of the ranking, the struggle is no longer 
carried out strictly in the direction of improving the quality 
of life of the population, but, rather, toward identifying and 
offering new opportunities and toward implementing 
measures to protect the people in difficulty. Thus, as can be 
seen from Figure 3, the evolution of the developed countries 
is slower, sometimes with a negative trend, with the 
exception of the states that are at the base of the ranking of 
the most developed countries. From this perspective, 
developed countries need to focus on improving their own 
systems, on importing and implementing solutions that work 
in other states (e.g. the Swedish model of education system 
implemented 
in 
Finland 
etc.) 
and 
on 
supporting 
disadvantaged countries because, in a globalized economy, 
the mutual development allows the fruition of the relations 
between partners. 
Thus, having identified the areas where the standard of 
quality of life is low, political drivers can take the necessary 
measures to reduce the disparities between high-growth 
countries and those with low-growth. At the same time, non-
governmental factors have at their disposal a set of data that 
allows them to monitor the activity of the decision-makers 
regarding the reduction of the gaps registered between the 
European Union Member States.

CONCLUSION 
The analysis of the standard of living of the population is 
a complex process that should not be limited only to 
determining the degree of economic development of the 
analyzed area but should be extended also to the social side 
by determining the degree of satisfaction that the analyzed 
group shows in society. Therefore, in addition to the 
economic and financial spheres that reflect the degree of 
economic development and the financial situation, when 
calculating the Quality of Life Index, analysts must also 
consider social indicators that reflect the level of contentment 
of individuals, the level of employee training and the degree 
of absorption in the field of work, the level of security that 
the state offers to the members within its society, the 
confidence of individuals amongst their peers and within the 
state institutions, etc. 
By analyzing the data sets presented above, it can be 
noticed that the eastern part of the European Union, together 
with several states in the northern area, presents the lowest 
QoLI values; all these states having a common denominator: 
having been governed by a communist dictatorial regime 
until the 1990s. Unlike the countries of Continental Europe 
and Scandinavia, the lack of a modern vision, and the

transition from the communist era to the democratic one, can 
be a determining factor in terms of slower development. 
However, it is important to note that, although the former 
communist states had an additional impediment in the path to 
a harmonious development, for the analyzed period of time, 
all these states have a general upward trend of the QoLI level. 
Therefore, the consolidation of the dimensions from both 
the economic and financial spheres as well as from the social 
one, in a single complex indicator such as QoLI, allows to 
carry out complex analysis regarding the level of 
development of some regions and the degree of population 
satisfaction. Thus, with the eLIF framework [4], through 
which the values of the quality of life index can be calculated 
for a given period, political factors have the possibility to 
identify the disadvantaged states that must be supported in 
order to achieve one of the objectives of the European Union, 
that of strengthening the economic, social and territorial 
cohesion and solidarity between Member States. 
Also, this framework allows both non-governmental 
organizations to supervise the involvement of the 
government sphere in applying measures to increase the 
standard of living of the population, as well as to economic 
operators to identify areas with potential for development. 
Another important feature of the framework is its 
adaptability, which can be easily extended to any level of 
administrative detail by including in the analyzed list the 
name of the administrative unit targeted, whether it is a city, 
region, country or other form of administration, provided that 
the administrative unit is of the same type (it would not be 
feasible to compare the QoLI values recorded in counties 
with those of the regions or the values of any other types of 
different administrative units). 
Regarding the further development direction, three main 
objectives will be considered: i) automatic integration of the 
results of the parliamentary elections data set, so as to fully 
automate the calculation process; ii) identification of 
alternative reliable data sources for completing the data sets 
excluded from the analysis (presented in Table III); iii) 
integrating both the QoLI result and the result of the 
dimensions that compose it into an information system 
similar to Visit Romanian Museums [46] touristic 
information system.
