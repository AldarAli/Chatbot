Abstract— Digital innovations have caused a shift in customer 
expectations, resulting in a new kind of modern buyer – the 
digitally conscious customer. The customer experience plays a 
crucial role in digital transformation and vice versa – a lot of 
digital transformation initiatives arise from customer’s pain 
points, business innovation needs and growth imperatives on 
understanding 
patterns 
of 
digital 
purchasing 
culture, 
eliminating information seeking barriers, enhancing virtual 
social interactions, and overcoming challenges of digital 
literacy. The focus of the research is on the transformation of 
purchase process. The research aims to understand the new, 
digital customer journey and behaviour changes patterns, and 
map the transformation process of value-based purchase and 
retail processes. For scholars and practitioners, it is necessary 
to understand who is driving the change in the modern world – 
the digital technology phenomena or the customer value-push 
approach. 
The 
research 
contributes 
to 
the 
practical 
understanding of how digital innovations have affected the 
online information seeking process and what barriers in 
communication have arisen, such as how online social 
interaction and information filter bubbles affect customers and 
at the same time how the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) and 
"dark social" phenomenon affect companies' strategies. 
Customer journeys are becoming more extensive and versatile, 
but also challenging. Thus, the result of the research 
contributes to future mapping the compromise between 
purchase & retail processes for the Modern Customer Journey 
in the digital age.  
Keywords - digital journey; customer journey; digital 
innovation; digitalisation; customer experince. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
The dynamic world we live in is continuously and rapidly 
changing. The ubiquity of the information communication 
technologies has transformed the customer experience. The 
influence of current digital technologies on the lives of 
individuals and communities is evident, and one may claim, 
unprecedented. Mark Weiser [1] 30 years ago in his essay 
“The Computer for the 21st Century” wrote that “the most 
profound technologies are those that disappear...”, they “will 
be so ubiquitous that no one will notice their presence” 
because these technologies will become inseparable and 
indistinguishable from everyday life. The aim of the present 
paper and the ongoing research conducted by the authors is 
to investigate how digital innovations affect user behaviour. 
Digital innovations have caused a shift in customer 
expectations [2], resulting in a new kind of modern buyer 
culture – the digitally conscious customer. The customer 
experience plays a crucial role in digital transformation and 
vice versa – a lot of transformation initiatives arise from 
customer’s pain points (such as purchase convenience, 
online research, website navigation, checkout process, etc.), 
business innovation needs and growth imperatives on 
understanding patterns of digital purchasing culture, [3] 
eliminating information seeking barriers, [4] enhancing 
virtual interactions, and overcoming challenges of digital 
literacy. The digital age, introduced to customers via 
emerging technologies and digital innovations, is inevitably 
changing patterns of societal progress, consumption culture, 
human interaction, values, [5] and even (virtual) identity [6]. 
Embracing digital transformation requires companies to 
identify technologies, that are applicable to their strategy and 
how those may be enacted in the business offerings. As 
digital technology burrows deeper into the organizational 
processes and market offerings, it will inevitably affect 
business strategies, as firms revaluate their perceptions of 
themselves, as well as their relationships with partners and 
customers [7]. Firms are feeling the pressure not just to alter 
their existing business models, but also to operate a portfolio 
of different business models to cope with increasingly 
volatile customers preferences, who demand both, flexibility 
and personalization of products and services [8]. 
Culture is the informational basis of human society, a 
vital condition for its existence. As such, culture is 
inseparable 
from 
the 
information 
and 
information 
technologies. Levin and Mamlok [9] argue that the 
widespread use of digital technologies constructs and 
arranges virtual cyberspace that has become an integral part 
of people’s existence. Yet, cyberspace does not replace the 
familiar reality, but rather complements it and becomes its 
integral part. Perhaps, the most decisive change relates to the 
replacement of the traditional concept of the human being as 
a separate entity by a new ontological self-perception of 
human beings as an information organism, interconnected 
with the entire world. 
Communication has a tremendous effect on our lives; 
transformation of the way how people interact with each 
other, gain information, and learn new things has also been 
affected by digital innovations. Cultural changes or 
modification of society values and habits are influenced by 
18

innovation and invention, globalization and cooperation, and 
the digital innovations are the drivers behind this.  
The societal progress would be impossible without digital 
innovations and interaction between society and technology. 
Practitioners and scholars state that the customer is the one 
who is driving the changes which shape the process of 
digitalization. The challenge is that companies' strategies 
remain behind the speed of transformation [10]. New 
technologies have also created novel challenges for 
companies to understand the changing behaviour of 
customer. 
For practitioners and scholars, it is necessary to 
investigate emerging digital innovation in the consumption 
culture and value-based retail process. Understanding how 
customers react to personalized ads and how those affect 
buyers’ behaviour and priorities may ease the digital 
innovation adoption process for companies [11].  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II, we describe the planned methods that are going to be 
implemented to gather data; in Section III discusses the key 
aspects of digital transformation and digital innovations; in 
Section IV the digital customer journey challenges are 
discussed; in section V the profile of the digitally conscious 
customer is discussed; section VI presents the further 
research objectives. 
II. METHODS 
The main methodology of the further research is analysis 
of consumer data, literature review, consumer interviews, 
customer surveys, social media monitoring, survey data from 
an online panel, secondary data analysis (previous research, 
statistics, etc.), questionnaires and case studies analysis. The 
empirical approach is addressed through experiments of 
purchase and retail processes. The customer perspective we 
plan to investigate via surveys, questionnaires, interviews, 
focus group discussion, primary and secondary data review. 
Customer data we aim to collect with the help of commercial 
providers and to analyse it themselves. After data review it is 
planned to test out theories and hypotheses via dialogues and 
surveys. To address company’s perspective, we aim to 
conduct dialogues, questionnaires, secondary data reviews. 
Case studies are going to be analysed. Based on the results, 
there will be developed strategies for practitioners to 
understand the opportunities to reach the satisfaction 
equilibrium between customer and retailer. Via qualitative 
research, 
there 
will 
be 
investigated 
the 
cultural 
characteristics of the customer journey and retail process. 
The developed strategies are going to be piloted and then 
conducted the second round of collecting the customer and 
retailer vision and feedback. 
Data will be collected fully anonymised with use of a 
mixed method approach for the triangulation of data. We aim 
at carrying cross-European empirical studies to understand 
the comparative perspectives of digital customer journeys. 
We aim to develop the field of purchase and retail processes 
for modern customer journey conceptually and empirically; 
establish collaboration with the stakeholders (digital 
customers and online retailers; practitioners and scholars). 
The present paper is based on literature review. 
III. 
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION  
Literature does not provide a generally accepted 
definition of digitalization nor digital transformation; 
however, some scholars argue that digitalization as a 
technology-induced 
transformation 
process 
improves 
organizational flexibility, agility, and responsiveness by 
simultaneously aligning its operations, strategy, business 
processes, and organizational and IT structures to 
technological advancements [12]. Digital transformation 
cannot be exclusively focused on the technologies, it 
includes alignment of organizational leadership, relationships 
with partners and customers, resources, technology, 
processes, structure, and culture with a strategy that supports 
them and serves as a basis for achieving a competitive 
advantage. According to Denner [13], digitalization of 
products and services is a fast-moving, global megatrend that 
transforms value networks across all industries. Legner et al. 
[14] describe digitalization as a pervasive force, that involves 
transformations of key business operations and affects 
products and processes, as well as organizational structures 
and management concepts.  
There is no commonly agreed definition and set of 
differences between digitalization and digital transformation, 
and scholars continue to use the terms interchangeably, 
without clear statement what is understood by the certain 
terms. Henriette et al. [15] define digital transformation as 
changes in the ways of working, roles, and business offerings 
caused by adoption of digital technologies in an 
organization, or in the operation environment of the 
organization, including process level, organization level, 
business domain level, society level. It affects organizational 
strategies and challenges existing business models to be 
reconsidered and disrupted [16]. Existing business models 
are being optimized, transformed by reconfiguration and 
extension, but some devoured by more adjusting competitor.  
Digital transformation provides companies with an 
opportunity to improve their performance, increase reach and 
ensure better results by using digital innovations [17]. Those 
bring new actors, structures, practices, values, and beliefs 
that complement or disrupt existing practices within 
organizations and industries by affecting all key processes in 
the organization [18]. New business model typology based 
on the smartization of products and services has been 
introduced. In the world of Industry 4.0, sustainability of 
business models is being questioned. Digitalization has its 
impact on collection of operational data through sensors with 
low human intervention, enhances efficiency of data sharing 
among digital units through connected devices [19].  
Innovation concept has been popularized and studied by 
Schumpeter [20]. He described innovations as creative 
destruction or a process of industrial mutation [21] that 
continually changes the existing, destroys old and creates 
new. Innovation, is traditionally perceived as a creative 
disruption thus, presenting a threat to traditional business 
models, current organizational structures, and well-
established business operations [22]. Innovation is the core 
of transformation, and the concept of digital transformation 
is closely related to the definition of innovation. Innovation 
19

is understood as a process of a new or substantially improved 
product, 
idea, 
method, 
or 
business 
process 
being 
implemented 
or 
commercialized 
in 
the 
market 
or 
organization, creating a new value for the consumer, 
competitive advantage new industries and job positions and 
forms along with catalysing the economic growth [23]. 
Digital innovation is understood as implementation of the 
new digital technologies either to the existing practices with 
an aim of their optimization or introducing new process. 
According to [6] the digital concerns arisen from digital 
transformation are lack of clear vision, customer expectation, 
outcome ambiguity, familiarity over innovation, socio-
technical misalignment, and cultural inertia.  
The traditional ways of doing business have changed 
dramatically with the emergence of new information 
technologies. The Internet of things, machine learning, 
artificial 
intelligence, 
cyber-physical 
systems, 
cloud 
computing, wireless networks, robotics, augmented reality, 
big data analytics, and simulations are some of these key 
digital technologies. Nowadays, all physical devices can 
connect to the Internet. Cyber-physical systems incorporate 
the functions of computing, communications, precision 
control, coordination, and autonomy. Cloud technologies can 
be used to increase data sharing across company boundaries, 
improve agility and flexibility of system performance, and 
reduce costs by bringing systems online. Simulation 
optimization-based tools are used for complex systems and 
automation technologies. As a result, systems are becoming 
smarter by using these technologies. These means provide 
opportunities for enhancing customer journey and improving 
customer experience.  Moreover, big data and analytics are 
used for scaling and evolving information technology. The 
data with larger volumes and speeds can be analysed more 
precisely and faster decisions can be made with these 
technologies. The ability to adopt digital innovation is 
becoming a vital mechanism for organizations [24]. The 
capabilities of digital innovations bring great potential for 
companies to enhance customer experience, improve 
communication with purchasers and better understand 
clients’ needs. 
In the frames of the present paper and further research, 
the focus is on the digitalization of consumption and its 
social, 
cultural, 
ethical, 
political, 
and 
economical 
implications. It, thus, answers the call for more research on 
how customers react to personalized ads and how it affects 
buyer behaviour and priorities, consumer activities such as 
the purchase, comparison, and examination of goods [25]. 
The rate at which digital technology can spawn new the 
“smart” products and services is matched only by its ability 
to extend the reach and range of social interactions via 
ubiquitous infra-structure and malleable platforms [26].

Companies obtain massive 
data on consumer 
behaviour. Arising privacy 
issues include 
identification of features 
unknown to the user, 
localization and tracking, 
profiling, making private 
information public and 
linking separate 
information that the user 
does not like to be linked.

AR creates an add-on and 
interactive experience of a 
real-world environment 
through computer-
generated displays, thereby 
creating more interactive, 
vivid, and richer 
experiences for consumers 
[30]. 
Companies are able to 
enhance customer 
engagement and customer 
journey by implementing 
AR, VR and MR. AR is 
being commercialized 
actively, meanwhile VR 
and MR are held behind 
due to the lack of suitable

effectiveness of its social media marketing efforts through 
certain cloud-enabled functions. These insights allow to 
create more relevant and personalised offers for users. In the 
age of social media, businesses have lost quite a lot of 
control over how their brand is perceived. However, on the 
other hand, they have gained a lot of third-party voices that 
can help them promote their brand. Social media is a much 
cheaper and more accessible form of advertising for 
businesses than traditional media, representing a huge 
opportunity. What businesses need to consider in their 
engagement strategy in social media is how they can make 
their messaging contextual and consistent to their target 
audience. This is especially if their main buying segment is 
millennials, who tend to be extremely active and vocal on 
social media and look for brands that align with their values 
and beliefs. 
IV. DIGITAL CUSTOMER JOURNEY 
Digital customer journey and digital customer behaviour 
change patterns are not yet clearly defined. The research, on 
which this paper is based, aims to offer a better 
understanding 
of 
these 
concepts 
and 
an 
integrate 
technological (embodiment), psychological (presence), and 
behavioural (interactivity) perspectives to propose a new 
taxonomy of purchase and retail process in the digital age, 
namely the complementary models, presenting the value-
based compromise between purchase & retail processes for 
modern customer journey in digital age. The models and the 
equilibrium will assist in enhancing digital customer journey 
and provide better opportunities for retailers for economic 
growth. The research aims to provide a better understanding 
of the cultural differences in customer behaviour change 
patterns and digitalization of customer journey; analysis of 
the digital environment complementary elements' effect on 
the purchaser and retailer; map of the social and cultural 
aspects interactions with digital innovations. 
There is no one unique, or even one-industry 
comprehensive strategy approach for the customer journey 
digitalization. 
Digital 
technologies 
have 
affected 
consumption practices – changes in customer behaviour, 
values and loyalty, increased influence of judgements from 
social media, [33] personalized ads, filter bubbles [34] [35], 
information asymmetry and social virtual inclusion affect 
customer's digital journey. Due to the information filter 
bubbles, barriers in communication and the non-transparent 
nature of algorithmic filtering digital users are not aware of 
being in an information asymmetry. The patterns of purchase 
process transformation arise from the customers’ changing 
priorities, barriers in communication and social interaction, 
information seeking challenges and habits. Digital literacy of 
customers also is an important aspect in the transformation 
process, it is affected by the filter bubbles, dark social (non-
traceable source of feedback or way information sharing) and 
“zero moment of truth” (ZMOT) [36] phenomena. ZMOT is 
related to the digital value: the degree to which one actively 
searches for and trusts other users' feedbacks on their shared 
experiences of a product. Aside with the purchase process, 
changes arise with the effect on digital innovation on social 
anxieties, feelings of (in)security, customer loyalty and 
emergence of such phenomena as “virtual identity” [37]. 
In the transformation process the focus of companies’ 
(retailer) perspective lies on the value-based retail chain. Is 
not clear, how do the global interaction, the necessity of 
implementing sustainable approach and meeting the 
customers’ needs affect the development of the value-based 
retail chain. Practitioners are aware, that nowadays, it is the 
customer, who has the power of setting the values, thus the 
customer value-based proposition is crucial for companies’ 
livability. Digital innovation has provided new possibilities 
for retailers, but simultaneously have arisen challenges that 
affect companies’ data analysis and strategy [38]. 
With the present paper and further research, we aim to 
understand the transformation process of the purchase 
process, and what are the drivers behind (virtual identity, 
customer changing values, customer loyalty factors, etc.), 
explore what are the modern barriers in the information 
seeking 
and 
communication 
processes 
(information 
asymmetry, social online interactions, dark social, filter 
bubbles, ZMOT, etc.), understand, what are the challenges of 
digital literacy. We aim to map the change patterns brought 
by digital innovation, that have affected the consumption 
culture, user’s identity formation, social interactions in the 
online world and understand the possible future scenarios.  
Despite the popularity of digital innovations among 
customers and retailers, knowledge of their impact on the 
customer journey remains limited. The main priority for 
retailers is to better understand the customers behaviour and 
their values and then to enhance the journey of digital 
purchase [39]. No prior research has analysed in the depth 
digital innovation affection on customer values, identity, 
behaviour, 
and 
journey. 
Processes, 
data, 
agility, 
prioritization, technology, integration, information, business 
and IT alignment, digitization etc. all matter but are 
conditions for better customer experiences. 
V. 
DIGITALLY CONSCIOUS CUSTOMER 
Smartphones, mobile apps, machine learning, and 
artificial intelligence provided customers the opportunity to 
get what they want and when they want it. This has 
contributed to a shift in customer expectations and created a 
new kind of consumer – one that has changed the way 
business is done in specific industries. The concept of digital 
customer engagement refers to encouraging users to obtain 
digital channels across various industries remotely [27]. 
According to [27], there’s lack of studies concerning the 
factors affected by digital customer engagement. Thus, it is 
crucial to understand digital customer’s profile. 
Disruptive technologies that reduce friction for the 
customer journey tend to be the ones that enhance the 
customers’ experience. There is a strong correlation between 
the effort score and the customer satisfaction levels — the 
lower the effort required by the customer to conduct business 
with a company, the higher their satisfaction level. The 
customer experience plays a crucial role in the digital 
transformation, many digital transformation initiatives arise 
from customers pain points. These are caused by the 
increasing importance of an end-to-end customer experience 
21

improvement approach, which in turn is, among others, 
caused by changing customer expectations and customer 
experiences.  
According to [40], the digital customer experience and 
electronic word of mouth (social media) also played positive 
role on promoting brand image. Digital customer experience 
through e-commerce and electronic word of mouth played 
positive role to boost brand image, brad image had positive 
role to boost supply chain image and finally promoted the 
performance of the sustainable supply chain. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the digital consumption process on one hand is the 
customer, on the other is the retailer. In the future we aim to 
continue the research by approaching this phenomenon from 
the perspective of business interactions and social 
consequences to map the state of current situation of barriers 
in information seeking, lacking digital capabilities, changing 
patterns of customer loyalty, patterns of customer behaviour 
changes. Further research requires to relate these occurrences 
from historical and geographical perspectives’ differences 
and provide scenarios on future changes. It is necessary to 
test empirically the findings of the present research. The 
added value from interdisciplinarity is the comprehensive 
understanding on the research questions, it provides 
understanding for stakeholders on how deep the business, 
society and technology are connected. 
Besides adeptly performance of high-quality academic 
research, meticulous examination of practitioners' case 
studies, and big data analysis of digital customers and online 
users, it is a crucial need to have a real dialogue with the 
society, respectively with representatives of different age, 
gender, and cultures. The public engagement is needed to 
address the research questions of digital customer priorities, 
barriers in information seeking, social interaction, social 
anxieties, feelings of insecurity and customer values. To 
better understand the current state of digital customers and 
online users' feeling of inclusion and level of social media 
judgement affection is not enough to analyse raw data and or 
perform single questionnaires. The data obtained from digital 
innovation agents about digital consumption is needed, but it 
is limited by the information asymmetry impact, filter 
bubbles and other restrictions and inequalities put by digital 
technologies. For making research as close to the real 
situation are needed participatory dialogue events such as 
focus groups and workshops.  We plan to engage society in 
panel debates, focus groups dialogues, workshops, media 
engagement and webinars first to inform society (to assist 
them in understanding the problem the project addresses), to 
hear out their feedback on the project analysis and research 
results, involve society to ensure that the research is on the 
right path in understanding and considering societal 
challenges in the usage of digital technology in purchasing 
process. The societal engagement aims to obtain the clear 
perspective of the research issues and enhance the result 
quality.  
Enhancing customer digital journey requires creative 
approach, in the future research we aim to investigate if the 
human personnel can be replaced by the emerging 
innovations. It is assumed that historical and geographical 
comparison will help understand the process and address 
challenges in developing Modern Customer Journey. The 
future research aims to provide better understatement of 
digital literacy in consumption, map of digital innovation 
effect on the digital user and clear definition of cultural 
differences. For stakeholder communities the benefit of the 
present research is the awareness of digital innovation 
potential (positive and negative), ways of overcoming the 
digital challenges, enhanced customer journey and better 
value proposition from retailers.
