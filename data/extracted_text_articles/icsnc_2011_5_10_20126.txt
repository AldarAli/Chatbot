Abstract—This paper investigates the traffic capacity and the 
quality of service provisioning in cognitive radio networks used 
as secondary networks for dynamic spectrum access in 
accordance with the hierarchical spectrum overlay approach. 
An analytical model for cross-layer performance analysis of 
secondary cognitive radio networks is developed. New 
performance measures for the interference experienced by the 
primary and the secondary users are proposed. A novel 
approach for evaluation of the call dropping probability of the 
secondary users is suggested.

 INTRODUCTION 
Cognitive radio (CR) is the key enabling technology for 
dynamic spectrum access (DSA) [1]. DSA is a new paradigm 
for spectrum regulation which is expected to solve the 
problem with the inefficient spectrum use caused by the 
current static command-and-control approach for spectrum 
regulation (see [2] and the references therein). Radio 
spectrum is a scarce and precious resource and the spectrum 
demands grow increasingly due to newly emerging wireless 
services and applications. Therefore, efficient spectrum 
utilization becomes a matter of great importance.  
Hierarchical spectrum overlay is an approach for DSA 
where secondary (unlicensed or cognitive) users (SUs) are 
allowed to use opportunistically and on a non-interference 
basis spectrum resources which have been assigned to 
primary (licensed or incumbent) users (PUs) but are not 
currently being used (by any PU). The SUs transmit on 
momentarily unoccupied spectrum segments without causing 
harmful interference to the PUs.  Because of the dynamic 
nature of the spectrum available to the SUs, the capacity 
evaluation and the quality of service (QoS) provisioning for 
the SUs is a challenging and demanding task. 
There are many publications on CR used for DSA in the 
literature. Issues related to spectrum sensing are investigated 
in [3]-[9]. Spectrum handover is studied in [10]-[13]. QoS-
related issues in CR networks (CRNs) are investigated in 
[14]-[19]. The capacity of CRNs is considered in [20]-[22]. 
Due to the nature of CR, cross-layer analysis has to be 
applied for a comprehensive and exhaustive performance 
evaluation. There are numerous publications related to cross-
layer issues in CRNs (see [23]-[30]). An overview of the 
general methodology for cross-layer design and some cross-
layer optimization schemes and algorithms are presented in 
[23]. Unified cognitive cross-layer architecture for the next-
generation IP-based mobile tactical networks is proposed in 
[24]. The resource allocation problem in a multiuser 
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based 
CR system concerning the QoS provisioning for both real-
time and non-real-time applications is investigated in [26]. 
Although the papers mentioned above provide important 
results, they do not present a thorough CRN performance 
evaluation encompassing jointly the capacity, the QoS 
provisioning, and some specific CR mechanisms, such as 
spectrum sensing and spectrum handover. 
In this paper, a general and comprehensive cross-layer 
analytical model for thorough performance evaluation of 
CRNs is developed. It jointly considers the CR throughput 
and capacity, the CR QoS provisioning, namely the SU call 
dropping 
probability 
and 
the 
maximum 
tolerable 
transmission delay in the CRN, and the spectrum sensing and 
spectrum handover mechanisms. To the best knowledge of 
the author, the present paper is the first in the literature to 
propose and apply such a model.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The novel 
cross-layer model is presented in Section II, followed by 
numerical results in Section III. Section IV concludes this 
paper.    
II. 
THE ANALYTICAL CROSS-LAYER MODEL 
In the model, each SU is assumed to use one and the 
same transceiver for spectrum sensing and for transmission 
or reception. Spectrum sensing is performed periodically in 
compliance with predetermined quiet periods (QPs) during 
which all SUs stop transmitting to sense PU channels.  
In general, physical layer spectrum sensing for PU 
transmitter detection can be based on energy detection, 
matched filter detection, and cyclostationary feature 
detection [3], [4]. The latter two approaches outperform the 
energy-based detection but require some prior knowledge 
about the PU signals which may not always be readily 
available. In order to preserve the generality and the wide 
applicability of the proposed model, energy-based spectrum 
sensing is considered and assumed to be applied.  
Spectrum sensing may be cooperative or non-cooperative 
[4], [5]. In general, the former outperforms the latter. 
Cooperative spectrum sensing has already been exhaustively 
investigated (see [4], [5], [7] and [8]) and its advantages over 
non-cooperative spectrum sensing will not be discussed 
herein. Since under certain conditions (e.g., if only one SU 
operates on a given frequency band) cooperative spectrum 
sensing may not be possible, non-cooperative spectrum

sensing is assumed in order to develop a general and widely 
applicable framework for cross-layer analysis.  
Energy-based spectrum sensing is assumed to be 
performed with the optimal sensing threshold, i.e. the 
probability for misdetection is equal to the probability for 
false alarm:

where pd is the probability for detection, pf  is the probability 
for false alarm, and pe is the probability for detection error. 
Under these conditions, the probability for detection error 
can be expressed in terms of the Q-function [3]:

where SNR is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the PU signal, α  
is an intrinsic PU signal parameter that relates to its 
randomness (1≤α≤2; α=1 for constant amplitude signals, e.g. 
BPSK, QPSK,  and α=2 for complex Gaussian signals), and 
NB is the buffer size expressed as a number of samples. 
According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, we 
have: 
2
,
NB
= BW
τ                                 (3) 
where τ is the spectrum sensing duration for one PU channel 
and BW is the bandwidth of a PU channel. 
Substituting (3) into (2), τ can be obtained for given pe, 
SNR, BW, and α.  
Let us denote with Tss the total duration of the spectrum 
sensing procedure for a SU during one QP and with r the 
number of observed (sensed) PU channels. Then, we have:

r

where τi is the duration of the spectrum sensing for the ith 
observed PU channel.  
It should be noted that if the number of PU channels n in 
the system is relatively large, it is unreasonable for a SU to 
sense all the PU channels. Therefore, it can be assumed that 
the following relation holds true: 
r << n.                                          (5) 
Let us denote with Tp the duration of the spectrum 
sensing period. For simplicity, Tss is assumed to be equal to 
the duration of the QPs. Consequently, the nominal SU 
transmission time t within one spectrum sensing period is: 
.
p
ss
t
T
T
=

                                     (6) 
It should be noted that due to misdetections, false 
detections, and the PU activity, the mean effective SU 
transmission time Teff within one spectrum sensing period is 
actually less than the nominal transmission time t.  
Let us denote with Tint the mean interference duration 
within one spectrum sensing period due to simultaneous PU 
and SU transmissions on the same PU channel. The 
cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol of the 
CRN is assumed to provide perfect spectrum sharing among 
SUs, so that no interference occurs due to overlapping SU 
transmissions.  
The proposed approach for evaluation of Tint and Teff is 
similar to that in [4] but unlike the method used in [4] where 
a single-channel primary system is considered, the derivation 
of Tint and Teff presented in this paper is generalized in order 
to be applicable to a multichannel primary system. 
The PU call arrival and service processes are modeled by 
Poisson random processes with rates λp and µp, respectively. 
Hence, the offered PU traffic is:

where floor is a function that rounds its argument to the 
nearest integer towards minus infinity. It should be noted that 
when n > 1 (a multichannel primary network is considered) 
and the PU network is not overloaded with PU traffic, the 
relation a > 0 always holds true; otherwise, if the PU 
network is overloaded or congested by PU calls, the use of 
CR for DSA is obviously unreasonable. 
Taking 
into 
account 
the 
negative 
exponential 
distributions of the inter-arrival time and the service time of 
PU calls, η, a, t, and the possibilities for misdetection and 
false detection, Tint and Teff can be derived as follows:

where the first addend in (12) refers to the case in which a 
SU starts transmitting on an available channel and no PU 
calls arrive until the next spectrum sensing period or a new 
PU call arrives before the next spectrum sensing period but 
occupies another available channel or occupies the same 
channel; the second addend in (12) refers to the case in 
which a SU misdetects an occupied PU channel, starts 
transmitting on that channel and the PU call ends before the 
next spectrum sensing period.     
In (11) and (12), ηt is assumed to be the mean 
interference duration when a SU starts transmitting on an 
available channel and a new PU call occupies that channel 
before the beginning of the next QP or when a SU misdetects 
and starts transmitting on an occupied channel and the 
ongoing PU call ends before the next QP.  
Now the CRN throughput and capacity can easily be 
derived. The normalized mean effective transmission time ρ 
of a SU is: 
.

ρ = T
                                       (13) 
The CR is assumed to use non-contiguous OFDM (NC-
OFDM) waveform. NC-OFDM allows the CR to deactivate 
(null) the subcarriers overlapping with any PU transmission 
and thus to adjust the spectrum of its signal to fit into the 
available frequency gaps [17]. Furthermore, CR with NC-
OFDM can be deployed in any primary network irrespective 
of its channelization scheme and even if fixed channelization 
is not supported, which facilitates the wide applicability of 
the model developed in this paper. It has already been 
assumed that perfect spectrum sharing is provided by the 
cognitive MAC protocol. Based on the above-mentioned 
assumptions, the mean throughput of the CRN C (bit/s) can 
be obtained: 
,

served.

In order to evaluate the interference experienced by the 
PUs and to guarantee that the CRN will not degrade the 
performance of the primary network, the following 
constraints have to be satisfied:

normalized mean interference duration. In (18), γ is 
introduced as a new precise performance measure for the

In order to evaluate the interference experienced by the 
SUs, another new performance measure δ is proposed which 
is implicitly relevant to the CR QoS provisioning:

which incorporates the maximum tolerable transmission 
delay in the CRN is proposed. It is particularly applicable to 
the system model considered in this paper.

It can be assumed without loss of generality that SU call 
dropping occurs only if SU connection failure occurs. SU 
connection failure occurs when a SU is unable to transmit 
during several consecutive spectrum sensing periods and the 
maximum tolerable transmission delay D in the CRN is 
exceeded. It should be noted that D is a QoS-dependent 
parameter and may vary according to the type of application. 
 Let us denote with q the minimum number of 
consecutive spectrum sensing periods for which SU 
connection failure occurs if a SU does not have a successful 
transmission during all of these periods. Therefore, we have:

A SU is unable to transmit during a spectrum sensing 
period either due to misdetection and continuous interference 
during the nominal transmission time t, or due to detections 
of PU transmissions or false alarms on all of the observed 
channels. No transmission opportunities are missed due to 
unsuccessful spectrum handovers since the cognitive MAC 
protocol is assumed to provide perfect spectrum handover 
procedure. Consequently, taking into account the above

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, some numerical results (Fig. 1 – Fig. 6) 
obtained using the analytical model described above are 
presented and analyzed. For simplicity, but without loss of 
generality, it has been assumed that the SNR of the PU 
signals is equal on all of the n PU channels and that the 
duration of the QPs is equal to the duration of the spectrum 
sensing procedure Tss. 
Fig. 1 - Fig. 3 show the SU transmission efficiency ρ, the 
interference experienced by the PUs γ and by the SUs δ, and 
the SU call dropping probability, i.e. the SU connection 
failure probability pcf, as a function of the spectrum sensing 
period Tp for different number of observed channels r. When 
Tp increases, ρ, γ, δ, and pcf also increase. As r increases, ρ, 
and pcf decrease but the change in γ and δ is negligible. 
Moreover, when Tp >> τ and r is relatively small (as it has 
already been assumed in (5)), a change in r slightly affects ρ. 
Therefore, in this case, Tp has a dominant effect on both the 
CR throughput and on the interference, whereas r has a 
dominant effect only on the SU call dropping probability and 
affects the CR throughput to a significantly lesser extent in 
comparison with Tp. 
New performance measures γ and δ for evaluation of the 
interference experienced by the PUs and by the SUs have 
been proposed. In order to guarantee that the CRN operates 
on a non-interference basis both (17) and (18) have to be 
satisfied. When ρ is high and δ is relatively low, the CR 
operates efficiently under low interference. If δ is relatively 
high, the CR operates in a high interference environment 
either because of improper configuration of the spectrum 
sensing mechanism or because of unfavorable conditions for 
DSA, e.g. very high PU traffic load.  
Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 also show that if r increases, ρ and pcf 
both decrease, and vice versa. Consequently, by increasing r, 
it is possible to achieve more reliable communications in the 
CRN at the price of reduced throughput and capacity.  
Fig. 4 illustrates that the SU call dropping probability, i.e. 
the SU connection failure probability pcf, decreases if the 
maximum tolerable transmission delay D in the CRN 
increases. As r increases, pcf also decreases. Since D depends 
on the QoS requirements of the provided service, it can be 
concluded that the CR is particularly suitable for delivering 
of non-real-time delay-tolerant services.  
Fig. 5 shows the CR traffic capacity As as a function of 
the signal-to-noise ratio SNR of the PU signals. As SNR 
increases, the time required for spectrum sensing decreases. 
Therefore, the nominal transmission time t, and thus As, both 
increase. However, in order to satisfy the interference 
constraints (17) and (18), it may be necessary to reduce t by 
decreasing Tp. Due to the strong dependence of As on SNR, 
PU channels with higher SNR should be preferred for 
spectrum sensing. 
Fig. 6 shows the CR traffic capacity As as a function of 
the offered PU traffic Ap. As Ap increases, spectrum sensing 
has to be performed more frequently in order to satisfy the 
interference constraints imposed by the primary network, 
which means that Tp, and thus ρ and As, both decrease. The 
interplay of PU traffic and SU traffic should always be 
carefully considered. The deployment of CRNs for DSA is 
reasonable only if the primary network is sufficiently 
underutilized. 
The presented numerical results in this section lead to the 
general conclusion that many cross-layer interdependencies, 
such as those analyzed herein, should be considered in order 
to achieve optimal CRN performance.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, an analytical model for cross-layer analysis 
and performance evaluation of CRNs is developed. New 
performance measures, namely γ and δ, for evaluation of the 
interference experienced by the PUs and by the SUs are 
suggested. A novel approach for evaluation of the SU call 
dropping probability is proposed. Various cross-layer 
interdependencies are investigated and analyzed.  
The model is generic and comprehensive, which 
determines its wide applicability and theoretical significance. 
It can be applied to both infrastructure and ad hoc CRNs. 
Moreover, it can be used as a general cross-layer design 
framework which could be elaborated, modified, or adapted 
to meet specific design characteristics of a particular CRN. 
The analytical model presented in this paper could 
further be extended to consider cooperative spectrum 
sensing, imperfect spectrum handover, and imperfect 
spectrum sharing. Тhe spectrum sensing method could also 
be modified and matched filter detection or cyclostationary 
feature detection could be considered.
