 INTRODUCTION 
A model of microRNA:mRNA regulation and bonding 
from the standpoint of a cryptographic problem is being 
developed. miRNA:mRNA bonding exhibits a wide range of 
regulation. A single miRNA can regulate expression of many 
mRNAs and a single mRNA can be regulated by many 
miRNA. The mechanisms that determine specificity are not 
fully understood. The methodology of the work described in 
this paper is to treat miRNA:mRNA interaction as a short 
hash code authentication problem wherein multiple messages 
with different meanings may generate similar or identical 
codes. The underlying concept is that miRNA sequences can 
be treated as short messages. These messages appear to be 
identical, but are not. In fact, they are uniquely authenticated 
for 
a 
given 
mRNA 
target 
under 
conditions 
and 
conformations that are not totally apparent or understood. 
The challenge of this experimental modeling approach is that 
no assumptions are made about the seed and target sequences 
such as assumptions about evolutionary conservation of 
sequences, length of seed sequence, number and location of 
Watson-Crick pairs within seed:target locus, or any of the 
other 
commonly 
used 
(and 
often 
well-validated) 
assumptions. The goal is to determine if miRNA:mRNA 
regulation can be modeled within the context of a 
cryptographic approach.  
The paper is structured as follows: A description of the 
motivation for the research and the potential benefits is 
provided as well as the challenges in analyzing microRNA 
(miRNA) mediated regulation. This is followed by a section 
summarizing miRNA regulation pathway. This is followed 
by a section summarizing the steps in coding and modeling 
of the miRNA:mRNA problem. This is followed by a 
detailed discussion of the coding and modeling of the 
miRNA:mRNA problem and the resulting output data. The 
paper concludes with a discussion of model validation, future 
work and conclusions. 
A. Potential benefits to using cryptography to analyze 
problems in molecular biology 
The process of encryption and decryption can be used to 
accommodate uncertainty and lack of complete information 
with 
regards 
to 
biochemical 
pathways. 
Unknown 
information that would be essential in creating an accurate 
physics-based 
model 
can 
be 
accommodated 
in 
a 
cryptographic model. The cryptographic process allows for 
wide differentiation between objects that appear to be 
similar or identical.  In the case of microRNA, two similar 
sequences of 22 bases may have drastically different 
patterns of post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA 
expression. By using techniques from coding theory, 
identical genomic or proteomic sequences can be 
differentiated by specific coding for secondary structure, 
tertiary structure or other differentiating characteristics. The 
cryptographic process permits a hierarchy of coding such 
that an iterative modeling process can be performed. 
B.  Advantages of using a cryptography-based process 
One major advantage of this approach is that a properly 
operating authentication process incorporates all of the 
behavior of the system, including behavior that is currently 
not well understood or modeled. This includes lack of 
accurate knowledge of all relevant steric and electrostatic 
forces, concentration dependencies, and understanding of all 
relevant molecular interactions (protein-protein, nucleic 
acid-nucleic acid, protein-nucleic acid, etc.).  In this paper, a 
specific implementation of the protocol will be described 
that only includes the miRNA to mRNA interaction. New 
information about a process can be incorporated by 
expanding the model. The extensible nature of the model 
will allow for adding details such as RNA Induced 
Silencing Complex (RISC)-miRNA interaction coding as a 
future enhancement.

CHALLENGES IN ANALYZING MICRORNA MEDIATED 
REGULATION 
It is known that sequence information alone is 
insufficient to predict miRNA:mRNA regulation.  A single 
miRNA can regulate numerous mRNA. A single mRNA can 
be regulated by numerous miRNA. The presence of the seed-
target matches does not guarantee downregulation of mRNA. 
There are structural considerations such as single or double 
strandedness of the miRNA, and protein bonding domain 
interaction with miRNA are factors in successful miRNA 
translational regulation. Both cis- and trans-regulatory 
effects exist in miRNA regulation as well as cooperative 
bonding effects on multiple miRNAs amplifying the 
regulation of a mRNA target. Location of the target within 
the 3’ Untranslated Region (UTR) of the mRNA is a factor, 
but the target sequence can appear with an open reading 
frame, and appearance of the target within the 3’ UTR is not 
a necessary and sufficient condition for mRNA regulation.  
A. miRNA Regulation Pathway 
The miRNA gene is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II 
to produce a primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA). Due 
to the charged nature of RNA, it is never found free and is 
always complexed with a protein. The pri-miRNA transcript 
is processed by a complex of DROSHA and DGC8 proteins 
to a ds-miRNA hairpin pre-miRNA transcript. The pre-
miRNA transcript is transported from the nucleus to the 
cyotoplasm by Exportin 5 (XPO5) that can only bind pre-
miRNA in the presence of the RAN-GTPase cofactor [1]. 
TRBP recruits the RNAse III DICER complex [2] and 
DICER cleaves the transcript into a ds-miRNA guide and 
passenger strand. The guide strand complexes with Ago2 
and other proteins required for miRNA silencing, e.g., 
GW182 ) to form a RNA Induced Silencing Complex. RISC 
and 
mRNA 
targets 
that 
associate 
with 
sufficient 
complementarity and energetically favorable structures 
downregulate (or upregulate [3]) mRNA translational 
expression . 
B. miRNA:mRNA coding and modeling process 
  Each miRNA and mRNA sequence is coded into a 15-
bit vectors that represent the nucleotide sequence and 
assignment of secondary structure. There are 22 rows; one 
row for every nucleotide in the sequence. The 15 bit binary 
coded vectors are compressed into two sets of integer 
vectors (one integer equaling the sum of the 7 most 
significant bits and the other equaling the sum of the 8 least 
significant bits) for each miRNA, mRNA, a fully 
complementary miRNA sequence, e.g., let7d_comp) and  a 
fully anti-complementary, e.g., let7d_anti). The following 
basic steps are performed: 
 
Each vector is encrypted using a Rivest, Shamir and 
Adleman (RSA algorithm)  key pair (e,n).  
 
The encrypted vectors are decrypted with the 
correct private key and 12 other off-nominal keys in 
a process called detuning. 
 
For each 7-bit integer vector and each 8-bit integer 
vector, a linear vector projection is performed on 
mRNA vector to the miRNA vectors, the 
miRNA_comp vectors and miRNA _anti vectors.  
 
The projections of mRNA vectors onto the miRNA 
vector are compared to the projection of the mRNA 
vectors onto the miRNA_comp vector and the 
mRNA vector onto the miRNA_anti vector 
 
A regulation of expression score is computed on the 
basis of these comparisons.

     MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. MATLAB Prototype 
A prototype model built on the MATLAB platform was 
developed for this research. In this particular model, only 
nucleic acid interactions at the primary and secondary 
structure levels are captured. The prototype utilizes the RSA 
algorithm for encryption. Although the algorithm was not 
intended for this application, it performs well enough to 
demonstrate the principles behind the operation of the model. 
Future versions of the model will utilize a new key pairing 
algorithm that has been optimized for this application.  
B. Coding of RNA bases 
A binary representation of the four RNA bases is 
generated from a series of four 11-bit vectors. Each base is 
represented by a (15, 11) Hamming code. A (15, 11) 
hamming code codes a 11 bit data field in 15 bits and 
provides 4 check bits.  
C. Coding of Secondary Structure Dictionary 
RNA folding is necessary for proper functioning of 
biological activities [4]. The model requires that a secondary 
structure code be applied to every sequence (mRNA or 
miRNA), even if the secondary structure under evaluation is 
modeled as linear, single stranded. The secondary structure 
coding allows two identical sequences to be differentiated. 
Therefore the secondary sequence coding provides for an 
authentication capability. The prototype model has 5 
structural categories (classes of symbols) each with a 
probability mass function that is user-defined. Table I 
summarizes the categories. The location of each base within 
the sequence has a probability of being in a given structural 
category at its location in the nucleotide sequence. The base 
at that location is assigned a value from the Huffman code 
dictionary.  The dictionary is applied via a language that 
provides shorthand for performing the secondary structure 
coding. There are 409 codes assigned to each category.

D. Secondary Structure Coding 
A Huffman code generator produces a set of 2K x 15 bit 
secondary structure code dictionary to be applied as a hash 
code to each base in the RNA sequence. A Huffman code 
dictionary, which associates each data symbol with a 
codeword, has the property that no codeword in the 
dictionary is a prefix of any other codeword in the 
dictionary. The statistical frequency of a given secondary 
structure can be correlated to its Huffman code. Let N equal 
a finite field of a secondary structure space partitioned into 
sets of five members, with q = 409: 
 
Nk= {Xi,Pi,Wi,Li,Si}, 1  i  q, 1  k  22,                         (1)

Every base in the sequence falls into one of the above 
sets. The hamming distance, d, between nearest neighbors in 
any given set is: 
d(SSi

RNA structures have been experimentally shown to have 
a diverse free energy landscape and structural diversity [5]. 
The use of a space of Hamming codes to represent the 
multiplicity of energy and mechanical constraints on each 
molecular structure permits a dynamic modeling approach in 
which a progression of codes can be modeled to represent 
the diversity in the free energy states and structure. It 
remains to be seen if this approach is better than a 
conventional molecular simulations that rely on two-body 
additive force field equations or assumptions that involve 
finding the lowest energy conformation of a RNA sequence.  
The use of Hamming distances as a metric to evaluate 
RNA secondary structures and folding has been utilized 
other modeling approaches [6], however the taxonomy of the 
secondary structures being utilized in this approach is very 
different as well as the method of developing the secondary 
structure codes.  
E. Encryption, Decryption and Detuning 
The Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm was developed 
by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman from MIT to facilitate 
development public key infrastructure based security. 
Originally a classified algorithm, it passed into the public 
domain in September 2000 [7]. The RSA algorithm is a 
convenient mechanism for generating public/private key 
pairs for evaluation of secondary structure hash codes. In 
this model three sets of RSA public/private key pairs are 
used to eliminate any possible bias that might be introduced 
by a single set of keys. The vectors representing each 
sequence will be decrypted with the corresponding private 
key and with 12 other prime numbers in a process called 
detuning. The operation of decryption with keys of 
successively greater distances from the primary decryption 
key should be traceable to thermodynamic states of greater 
energy, i.e., lower stability and lower probability of 
occurrence) for a given sequence. For encryption key E = 5, 
the decryption keys of 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 
13, 11, 7 are used. The key pair of (5, 299) & (53,299) 
satisfies the RSA algorithm; the other decryption keys are 
for detuning. Similarly, for E = (1657, 24811) & D = (73, 
24811), D = 73, 1559, 1483, 1367, 1013, 1009, 691, 601, 
509, 443, 439, 349, 337 are used. For E = (89, 5629) & D = 
(233, 5629), D = 233, 229, 227, 223, 157, 137, 109, 101, 97, 
61, 53, 47, 43 are used. The vector is encrypted with three 
RSA key pairs, in this case (5, 53), (1657, 24811) and (89, 
5629).  
The data is formed by the set of error vectors of the 
decrypted vector projected onto the reference vector.  The 
RSA algorithm uses a public key (e, x) and a private key (d, 
x). There exist two prime numbers, p and q, p  q. The 
following relationships apply: 
 
x = p * q,                                                                           (10) 
(x) = (p-1) * (q-1),                                                          (11) 
e < (x) and relatively prime to (x),                               (12) 
de=1 mod (x) .                                                                (13) 
From the calculated key pairs, additional d’s that do not 
meet the de=1mod (x) are utilized as detuning keys. The 
resulting encrypted vector is decrypted with the decryption 
key specified by the algorithm and 12 additional keys that 
are different from the decryption key. The decryption key 
pairs for (5, 53) are (53, 299), (47,299), (43, 299), (41,299), 
(37,299), (31,299), (29,299), (23,299), (19,299), (17,299), 
(13,299), (11,299), and (7,299). The decryption key pairs

24811), (349,24811) and (337,24811). The decryption key 
pairs for (89, 5629) are (233,5629), (229, 5629), (227,5629), 
(223,5629),(157,5629), (137,5629), (109,5629), (101,5629), 
(97,5629), (61, 5629), (53,5629), (47,5629) and (43, 5629).  
The data is formed by the set of error vectors described in 
the following paragraph.  
The working hypothesis is that the (dm, x), (m=1,2,..,13) 
combination represents a projection of miRNA:mRNA with 
successively lower probabilities of occurrence as dm 
diverges  from d1, e.g., higher minimum free energy for a 
successful regulation event (either up or down regulation). 
Each decryption key pair is associated with a probability 
mass function (pmf), P: 
 
P = {p1,p2,…pm}={ 2-1,2-2,…,2-13}, m=1,..,13

F. Projection of vector column spaces and generation of 
error vectors 
Each sequence is now represented by a series of 
decrypted column vectors. The modeling of miRNA 
association to a mRNA is simulated by the projection of the 
column space of a decrypted mRNA onto the column space 
of the decrypted miRNA under evaluation. It is the error 
vector of the projections that form the data, not the 
projection vectors. Each representation of a sequence 
consists of a column space of two vectors, one derived from 
the 7-bit portion and one derived from the 8-bit portion. Fig.

Each 
mRNA:miRNA simulation has 6 sets of error vectors 
calculated from the error vectors of projections of: 
a) 7-bit mRNA on miRNA for all 3 (e,x), (dm,,x) 
combinations 
b) 8-bit mRNA on miRNA for all 3 (e,x), (dm,,x) 
combinations

An example of the origin of the variables is shown in 
table III. E1, E2, and E3 are the value of the error projection 
for mRNA GATM at the 22nd base position in (starting at 
position 289 referenced to the 5’end) when projected onto 
let-7d miRNA, let-7d miRNA complement and let-7d 
miRNA anticomplement at the same position. The 
projection is for the encryption key pair (89,5629) and the 
decryption key pair (43,5629). This leads to geometric 
relationship shown in Fig.  2. 
G. Significance of the relationship between  and 
 represents the angular distance between the 
mRNA:miRNA projection to a perfectly complimentary 
sequence projected on the miRNA (let-7d comp:let-7d). The 
smaller the angular distance the greater the similarity 
between the state of basepairing (bp) in mRNA:miRNA bp 
and the corresponding mRNA_comp:miRNA.  represents 
the angular distance between the mRNA:miRNA projection 
to a perfectly anti-complimentary sequence projected on the 
miRNA (let-7d anti:let-7d). The smaller the angular distance 
the greater the similarity between the error vector projection 
in 
mRNA:miRNA 
and 
the 
corresponding  
mRNA_anti:miRNA. It is postulated that there exists an 
optimum  and  that represent a maximization of the 
probability of stabilizing the sequences such that regulation 
(either up or down) is maximized. The scoring criteria is to 
retain all scores that satisfy sin  < r*sin , where r ≤ 1. For 
this paper, r = 1. The following scoring logic applies: 
sj,m = [(sin j,m)/(sin j,m)]*pm ,                                         (18) 
where j = {1,…,22} nucleotides and m = {1,…13} 
decryption key pairs. 
IV. 
SCORING 
The evaluation of six mRNAs against a single miRNA 
yields a dataset of up to 20,592 values of  and . Large 
datasets such as this are good candidates for single value 
decomposition (SVD) analysis is used to extract the 
principal values and score the data. SVD is widely used to 
identify the significant elements in large data sets [8]. It is 
widely used in analysis of gene expression.  The entire set 
for each mRNA:miRNA combination is combined into 
matrix of the form X = USVT. The score is the product of 
the most significant members of U and S. The software 
allows the user to bound the maximum and minimum 
scores. Widening the scoring range expands the predicted 
levels of up or down regulation.  The scoring range in table 
II was (-0.5, +0.5). The score is a direct correlation to the 
predicted level of post-transcriptional regulation, Bt,  by: 
 
Scoret = (U1,1 * S1,1), Bt = 2Score

There are two scores, t = 1 and t = 2 representing the 7-
bit and 8-bit integer scores respectively. The two scores 
provide an upper and lower bound of modeled regulation. 
The 
scoring 
range 
can 
span 
upregulation 
and 
downregulation predicted outcomes.                                               
A. mirSVR Scoring. 
The mirSVR algorithm is a powerful scoring system 
with a high degree of “ground truth” in its scoring 
methodology [9]. mirSVR scoring has been calibrated to be 
linear with log expression change. The mirSVR algorithm 
was trained on data from mRNA expression data from a 
panel of microRNA transfection experiments. Target sites 
are represented by miRNA:mRNA features, and local and 
global contextual features such as the composition of AU 
flanking sequences around the presumed mRNA target site. 
mirSVR uses features derived from the miRanda-predicted 
miRNA:mRNA sites, the extent of 3’ binding and local 
features such as AU composition flanking the target site and 
miRSVR defined secondary structure accessibility score. 
Other global features of the mirSVR scoring include length 
of UTR, relative position of target site from UTR ends, and 
conservation level of the block containing the target site. 
The downregulation scores from mirSVR correlate linearly 
with the extent of downregulation. Genes with multiple 
target sites can be scored by addition of the individual target 
scores. 
B. Cryptographic Scoring 
The cryptographic model provides a range of two scores. 
In this comparison, a let-7d sequence and mRNA sequences 
(from microRNA.org, with modifications to fit the 22 base 
sequence length model requirement) are programmed as 
single stranded RNA molecules without any internal 
Watson-Crick or G:U wobble pairing. The error vectors for 
the mRNA projected onto the let-7d vector are scored as 
previously described. Table II summarizes some early 
results. The scores for multiple target sites can also be 
summed to provide total mRNA regulation change.

VALIDATION PLAN AND FUTURE WORK 
The concepts in this paper require a high degree of 
validation. The goal is to team with a partner with the 
laboratory capabilities in running miRNA:mRNA regulation 
assays to: 
 
Validate the results with through carefully selected 
and executed assays. 
 
Evaluate all aspects of the coding and scoring 
algorithms. 
 
Determine the limits of the model to provide an 
accurate up or down regulation assessment. 
 
Increase the fidelity of the model by adding 
ribonucleoprotein-RNA interactions and RISC-
RNA interactions.  
 
Development of a rule set to facilitate automated 
coding and analysis of miRNA:mRNA model 
interactions. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A methodology for using tools from cryptography and 
information 
theory 
to 
analyze 
the 
regulation 
of 
mRNA:mRNA interactions has been presented. The work in 
progress preliminary model results support the concept of 
operations such that additional work will be conducted to 
optimize the model and validate the model results.
