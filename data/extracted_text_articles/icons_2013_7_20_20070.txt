Abstract—It is important to detect an odor in the human living
space and artiﬁcial electronic noses have been developed. This
paper considers an array sensing system of odors and adopts a
layered neural network for classiﬁcation. We use all measurement
data obtained from fourteen metal oxide semiconductor gas
(MOG) sensors. Some sensors are not sensitive while others are
sensitive. In order to classify odors, we use data from all fourteen
sensors even if some of them are not sensitive so much. We will
propose three methods to use the data by insensitive sensors
to ﬁnd the features of odors. Then, applying those features to a
layered neural network, we will compare the classiﬁcation results.

layered neural network; features of odor.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, much research has been done about the recogni-
tion and classiﬁcation of odors [1],[2],[3],[4]. It is important
for human beings to obtain high quality information on odor,
since it is one of our ﬁve senses. We have used these ﬁve
senses to enjoy comfortable human life with communication
and mutual understanding. Artiﬁcial odor sensing and clas-
siﬁcation systems through electronic technology are called
an electronic nose and they have been developed according
to various odor sensing systems and several classiﬁcation
methods [1],[2].
We have developed electronic nose systems to classify the
various odors under different densities based on a layered
neural network and a competitive neural network of the
learning vector quantization method [5], [6],[7],[8].
From our experience, it is difﬁcult to achieve the perfect
classiﬁcation even if we use many MOG sensors [9] since
some of them are insensitive for some odors. This means
that some sensors are actively sensitive and effective for
classiﬁcation. But insensitive sensors may become sensitive
for other odors and we cannot take away those sensors even
if they are insensitive for an odor since they could be useful
for the classiﬁcation of other odors.
To solve the dilemma, we use all sensors regardless of
sensitive or insensitive sensors. We extract the features of
odors by processing all sensors by reforming the data such
that insensitive data become useful. In this paper, we propose
three methods to extract the feature vectors by processing the
insensitive data.
After brief survey of the electronic nose and its measure-
ment and classiﬁcation methods, we propose three methods to
reform the data. The ﬁrst method (Method 1) is to reverse
the data belonging to an insensible group with respect to
horisontal axis and enlarge the negative data. The second
method (Method 2) is to rank the negative data of the method
1 and according to the ranking we assign some weights. The
third one (Method 3) is to add more information about the
transient property of odor data in addition to a maximum value.
Finally, simulation results for odor data are discussed to see
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
II. HUMAN OLFACTORY PROCESSES
Although the human olfactory system is not fully under-
stood by physicians, the main components of the anatomy
of human olfactory system are the olfactory epithelium, the
olfactory bulb, the olfactory cortex, and the higher brain or
cerebral cortex as shown in Fig. 1. The process of the human
olfactory system is shown in Fig. 2.
The ﬁrst process of human olfactory system is to breathe or
to sniff the odor into the nose as shown in Step 1 of Fig. 2.
The difference between the normal breath and the snifﬁng is
the quantity of odorous molecules that ﬂows into the upper
part of the nose. In case of snifﬁng, most air is ﬂown through
the nose to the lung and about 20% of air is ﬂown to the upper
part of the nose and detected by the olfactory receptors.
In case of snifﬁng, the most air ﬂow directly to the upper
part of the nose interacts with the olfactory receptors. The
odorous molecules are dissolved at a mucous layer before
interacting with olfactory receptors in the olfactory epithelium
as shown in Step 2 of Fig. 2.
The concentration of odorous molecules must be over the
recognition threshold. After that, the chemical reaction in
each olfactory receptor produces an electrical stimulus. The
electrical signals from all olfactory receptors are transported
to olfactory bulb as shown in Step 3 of Fig. 2.
The input data from olfactory bulbs are transformed to be
the olfactory information to the olfactory cortex as shown
in Step 4 of Fig. 2. Then the olfactory cortex distributes
the information to other parts of the brain and human can
recognize odors precisely as shown in Step 5 of Fig. 2. The
other parts of the brain that link to the olfactory cortex will
control the reaction of the other organ against the reaction of
that odor. When humans detect bad odors, they will suddenly
expel those odors from the nose and try to avoid breathing
them directly without any protection. This is a part of the
reaction from the higher brain.

Finally, the cleaning process of the nose is to breathe
fresh air in order to dilute the odorous molecules until those
concentrations are lower than the detecting threshold as shown
in Step 6 of Fig. 2. The time to dilute the odor depends on
the persistence qualiﬁcation of the tested odor.

III. ELECTRONIC NOSE SYSTEM
The electronic nose system is an alternative method to
analyze odor by imitating the human olfactory system. In this
section, the concept of an electronic nose is explained. Then
various sensors for odors applied as the olfactory receptors are
explained. Finally, the mechanism of a simple electronic nose
that will be developed in this paper is described in detail by
comparing the function of each part with the human olfactory
process.
The mechanism of electronic nose systems can be divided
into four main parts as shown in Fig. 3.
A. Odor delivery system
The ﬁrst process of the human olfactory system is to sniff
the odorous molecule into the nose. Thus, the ﬁrst part of the
electronic nose system is the mechanism to bring the odorous
molecules into the electronic nose system. There are three
main methods to deliver the odor to the electronic nose unit,
sample ﬂow, static system, and pre-concentration system.
The sample ﬂow system is the most popular method to
deliver odorous molecule to the electronic nose unit. Some

Step 2. Odorous molecules are dissolved and detected by 
the olfactory receptors
Step 3. Signals from olfactory receptors are transported to 
olfactory bulb
Step 4. Olfactory bulb transforms the information of 
olfactory bulb to the information of olfactory cortex  
Step 5. Information of olfactory cortices is distributed    
to the other parts of brain and human can identify the smell

carrier gas such as air, oxygen, nitrogen, and so on, is provided
as a carrier gas at the inlet port to ﬂow the vapor of the
tested odor through the electronic nose unit via the outlet
port. The mechanism to control the air ﬂow of an electronic
nose may contain various different parts such as a mass ﬂow
controller to control the pressure of the carrier gas, a solenoid
valve to control the ﬂow of inlet and outlet ports, a pump to
suck the tested odor from the sampling bag in case that the
tested odor is provided from outside, a mechanism to control
humidity, and so on. Most commercial electronic noses contain
complicated odor delivering systems and this makes the price
of the electronic noses become expensive.
The static system is the easiest way to deliver odorous
molecules to the electronic nose unit. The electronic nose
unit is put into a closed loop container. Then an odor sample
is injected directly to the container by a syringe. It is also
possible to design an automatic injection system. However,
the rate to inject the test odors must be controlled to obtain
accurate results. Normally, this method is applied for the
calibration process of the electronic nose. But, in this case, the
quantity of the odor may not be enough to make the sensor
reach the saturation stage, that is, the stage that sensor adsorbs

the odor fully.
The pre-concentration system is used in case of the tested
odor that has a low concentration and it is necessary to
accumulate the vapor of the tested odor before being delivered
to the electronic nose unit. The pre-concentrator must contain
some adsorbent material such as silica and the tested odor
is continuously accumulated into the pre-concentrator for
speciﬁc time units. Then the pre-concentrator is heated to
desorb the odorous molecule from the adsorbent material. The
carrier gas is ﬂown through the pre-concentrator to bring the
desorbed odorous molecules to the electronic nose unit. By
using this method, some weak odors can be detected by the
sensor array in the electronic nose unit.
B. Odor sensor array
The second process of the human olfactory system is to
measure various odors corresponding to various receptors in
the human olfactory system. In order to realize many receptors
artiﬁcially, we adopted two types of sensors. One is MOG type
and the other is QCM type. The idea of the present paper is to
use many sensors which are allocated in an array structure for
each type of MOG and QCM types. This structure is adopted
based on the human olfactory system. As we will explain in
what follows, the odor sensors are not so small and a rather
wide space is required to measure odors.
C. Data recording
The data recording is corresponding to temporal memory for
the human olfactory system. In the latter case, after learning
odors we could identify an odor suddenly, we store sensing
data of odors in a computer. To read and write the data, we
design an efﬁcient data base structure.
D. Data processing
Using the data base of odors, we must apply an intelligent
signal processing technique to recognize odors correctly. We
pre-process the odor data for noise reduction, normalization,
feature extraction, and so on. Then we use layered neural
networks and competitive networks for odor classiﬁcation
since learning ability and robustness are important in odor
classiﬁcation. The most difﬁcult and important process in the
odor classiﬁcation is to ﬁnd excellent features which are robust
for environment like temperature, humidity, and density levels
of odors.
IV. PRINCIPLE OF ODOR SENSING
Nowadays, there are many kinds of sensors that can measure
odorous molecules. However, only a few kinds of them have
been successfully applied as artiﬁcial olfactory receptors in
commercial electronic noses. Among them, we use MOG
sensors which will be explained in what follows.
A. Principle of MOG sensors
MOG sensors are the most widely used sensors for making
an array of artiﬁcial olfactory receptors in electronic nose
systems. These sensors are commercially available as the
chemical sensor for detecting some speciﬁc odors. Generally, a
MOG sensor is applied in many kinds of electrical appliances
such as a microwave oven to detect the food burning, an
alcohol breathe checker to check the drunkenness, an air
puriﬁer to check the air quality, and so on.
Generally, it is designed to detect some speciﬁc odor in
electrical appliances such as an air puriﬁer, a breath alcohol
checker, and so on. Each type of MOG sensors has its
own characteristics in the response to different gases. When
combining many MOG sensors together, the ability to detect
a odor is increased.

In order to classify the odors we adopt a three-layered neural
network based on the error back-propagation method.
V. EXPERIMENTAL DATA
We have carried out two experiments, Experiment I and
Experiment II, as shown in Table II where variation means
ﬂuctuation level for each species. In Experiment I, we have
measured the odors for the same kind of coffees produced
in the different countries such as Colombia, Guatemala, and
Ethiopia and the odors of two kinds of blend coffees such
as blend coffee 1 and blend coffee 2. In Experiment I, six
times of odors measurements have been repeated for each
coffee. Thus, the total number of features of odors are thirty
for ﬁve kinds of coffees. In Experiment II, we have measured
odors of three kinds of teas, coffee, and cocoa as shown in
Table II. In Experiment II, we have measured six times for
each species as done in Experiment II. Thus, total number of
the features in Experiemnt II is also thirty as in Experiment I.
The experimental conditions for both Experinet I and II are
summarized in Table III.

The neural network is a layered type based on the error
back-propagation method. The number of neurons for this
experiment are fourteen in the input layer, thirty in the hidden
layer, and three in the output layer, that is, 14-30-3 structure.

The reason why three neurons in the output layer is that three
bits can represent eight neumerals where in Experimet I and
Experiment II, we use ﬁve pattern for classiﬁcation.
We have separated the six measurement data for each odor
into three training data and three test data. The combination
of the data is 6C3=20 for each odor and total number of the
test data becomes 32 × 105. Among them we have selected
six thousand data for the evaluation. In Fig. 4 and Fig 5, we
show the sample paths of blend coffee 2 of Experiment I and
Tea of Experiment II, respectively.
We select the maximum value of each sample path as a
feature of an odor for a sensor. The reason to use the maximum
value is that the odor will be accumulated in the sensor for a
while in the beginning and then, the molecule will be oxidized,
which means that the resistance of the sensor becomes lowest.
Thus, the maximum value reﬂects steady state of the odor.
In the experiments, we have used fourteen sensors. Thus, for
each odor, we have a vector of fourteen dimensions. In Fig. 6
we show the feature vectors for three coffees of Colombia,
Guatemala, and blend 2 in Experinet I.
The classiﬁcation results using the data measured by using
fourteen sensors for Experinets I and Experiment 2 are given
by Table IV and Table V, respectively.
We notice that these experimental results are not so good.
Paticularly, in Experiment I it is necessary to improve the
classiﬁcation results. In this case, from Fig. 6 we can see that
there are two groups for the feature vectors. One is sensitive
for odors and the other is insensitive among fourteen sensors.
Thus, if we could use the data of insensitive sensors, we could
expect to improve the classiﬁcation results since there exist
differences of features between odors even if the ﬂuctuation
levels are not large.

VI. THREE METHODS FOR IMPROVING THE
CLASSIFICATION RESULTS
In what follows, we will propose three methods to use the
data in order to improve the classiﬁcation rate.
A. Method 1
Neurons become sensitive near thresholds since the deriva-
tive of the sigmoid function becomes maximum at the thresh-
old value. In other words, the outputs of the neurons become
insensitive when the absolute value of the net input becomes
very large. Thus, it is preferable to move the net input to
become some regions such as [-5,5]. Thus, we propose Method
1 stated as follows. First, we make two groups for the feature
vectors such that one is sensitive and the other is insensitive.
In Experiment I, lower ranking group (G1) is sensors 1, 2, 5,
6, 7, and 14 and higher ranking group (G2) is sensors 3, 4, 8,
9, 11, 12, 13.
Then, reverse the sign of values in G1 (cf. Fig 7) and scale
the values with negative sign such that the maximum among
G2 is equal to the absolute value of the smallest value of G1
by linearly interpolation (cf. Fig 8) .
B. Method 2
This method is a ranking of the measurement data. First,
separate the data into two groups, G1 and G2 as Method 1 and
reverse the sign of values in G1. Then, arrange in decreasing
order of absolute value and assign the value 1.4 for the ﬁrst

absolute vale. After that, scale the value in G2 in the same way
by assigning values from 1.7, 1.4, 1.3, 1.1, 0.9, 0.3, 0.3. The
scaled values were determined by trial and error according to
the rule that G2 is more important than G1 values (cs. Fig 9
C. Method 3
This method uses additional information about the transient
property. In addition to the maximum value we use the slop of
the transient slope (cf. Fig. 4). In this case, we must change the
number of neurons in the input layer and the neural network
becomes 28-30-2.
Using those methods, we have simulated Experiment I and
Experiment II. The simulation results for Experiment I by
three methods are shown in Table VI, Table VII, and Ta-
ble VIII, respectively. From these results, we can see Method
1 could improve the classiﬁcation results by 31% compared
with the result of Table IV.
Among three proposed methods, Method 1 is the best,
Method 2 is medium, and Method 3 is the worst for Experi-
ment I. This means that the slope information is not so much
efﬁcient to improve the classiﬁcation results for Experiment I.
The reason is that from Fig. 4 it is so sensitive to calculate
the slopes from the data and rough estimated values of the
slope results in worse classiﬁcation results. As for Method 2,
by trial and error the classiﬁcation results may be improved
more. But such trial is not so welcome in computation.
The simulation results for Experiment II by three methods
are shown in Table IX, Table X, and Table XI, respectively.
From these results, we can see Method 1 could improve the
classiﬁcation results by 11% compared with the result of
Table V.
Among three proposed methods, Method 1 is the best,
Method 3 is medium, and Method 2 is the worst for Experi-
ment II. This means that Method 2 is sensitive to the method

not so bad. Therefore, Method 1 is most preferable to improve
the classiﬁcation results.

increase the classiﬁcation accuracy. Basically, we have pro-
posed three methods by using the data measured by insensitive
sensors. From these results, using those data is efﬁcient to
improve the classiﬁcation accuracy so much. We will search
new features of odor information for classiﬁcation in the
future.
