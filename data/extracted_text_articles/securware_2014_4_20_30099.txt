Abstract—Cloud computing is widely used to provide on demand
services as a consequence of its beneﬁts such as reduced costs,
structure ﬂexibility and agility on resource provisioning. However,
there are still people that are not comfortable with the idea of
sending their sensitive data to the cloud such as the personally
identiﬁable information (PII) that could be used to identify
someone in the real world. Moreover, there have been cases of
data leaks, which resulted in huge losses both for companies
and its clients. Therefore, this article addresses the security and
privacy aspects of identity management. We present a model that
tackles privacy issues within the PII that is stored on identity
providers (IdPs). Thus, our proposal supports users and improves
theirs awareness when disseminating PIIs.

Introduction
Cloud computing is been largely adopted to provide ser-
vices to industry. As presented in [1] and [2], the reduced
costs, ﬂexibility and agility are the main characteristics for the
widespread successful of cloud computing. However, there are
people that are not comfortable to send their sensitive data to
the cloud [3]. Moreover, it is pointed out by the Cloud Industry
Forum in [2] that when the cloud is in discussion there are
huge debates not about the technology aspect per se, but rather
about the commercial and governance issues that relate to data
security and privacy.
Users have the right to be skeptic about the privacy and
security aspects of that model. Hence, there have been recent
cases of data breaches and leaks as noticed in [4] [5] [6],
which resulted in identity data leaks. Therefore, as pointed
by Betg´e-Brezetz, Kamga, Dupont and Guesmi in [7] cloud
service providers should focus on protecting sensitive data than
on tight security perimeters, hence, the biggest threat may be
internal.
S´anchez, Almenares, Arias, D´ıaz-S´anchez and Mar´ın in
[8] and De Capitani di Vimercati, Foresti and Samarati in [9]
discussed that as soon as users’ data is on identity providers
(IdP) the control on how that data is disclosed, stored and used
is lost. Moreover, data stored in the cloud may be sensitive and
if linked with its owner identity may violate his/her privacy.
This paper addresses some security and privacy aspects of
identity providers. In one side, we tackle the lack of control
that users have over their identiﬁcation data (PII) that is stored
on identity providers. On the other side, it is proposed an
enhancement in the dissemination process to support users with
their PII data disclosure, in a way that it is lowered the risks
of unaware/unintentional data dissemination.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II
gives a brief overview of the concepts that are going to be
used throughout this paper. Section III presents and discusses
related works. Section IV describes the issue that is going to
be addressed and presents our proposals. Section V closes the
paper with the conclusions and future works.

Background
In order to provide a better understanding of the issue
that is being addressed and the proposed model, this section
presents a brief overview on each concept that will be used
throughout the rest of this paper.
A. Privacy
Landwehr and et al. in [10] deﬁnes privacy as the control of
release of personal data that users have. Furthermore, privacy is
a fundamental human right as pointed out by United Nations
(UN) in its universal declaration of humans rights [11]. In
addition, the Human Rights Council reinforced that the same
right that people have oﬀ-line must also be protected on-line
[12].
Therefore, privacy is a vital characteristic that has to be
considered into every system. Identity provider systems should
not be an exception and have privacy added into its design.
In addition, Diaz and G¨urses presented in [13] three
diﬀerent paradigms of privacy:
•
Privacy as a control – privacy violations are often as-
sociated with disclosure of data to third parties. In this
context, privacy technologies provide individuals with
means to control the disclosure of their information
and organizations with means to deﬁne and enforce
data security policies to prevent abuse of personal
information for unauthorized purposes. Thus, the main
goal of this paradigm is to provide users with control
and oversight over collection, processing and use of
their data;
•
Privacy as conﬁdentiality – the previous paradigm
relies on the assumption that organizations that collect
and process users’ data are completely honest. How-
ever, once data is under the control of an organization,
it is hard for individuals to verify how their data is
being used. This paradigm aims to prevent information
disclosure, focusing on minimizing the information
82

SECURWARE 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

disclosed in a way that cannot be linked to users
identity;
•
Privacy as practice – this paradigm views privacy in
a social dimension, as users make privacy decisions
often based on how their social groups make those
decisions. In this context, technologies strive to make
information ﬂow more transparent through feedback
and awareness, enabling a better individual and col-
lective understanding on how information is collected,
analyzed and used.
Moreover, there are plenty of legislations that aim to protect
users’ privacy in the Internet and communication systems. In
Europe, there is the Data Protection Directive [14], in USA,
we have the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) [15], the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act [16], the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule [17] and in Brazil,
it was recently approved the Internet Bill of Rights[18]. All
of those aforementioned acts aim to protected users against
unwilling data disclosure and processing.
B. Identity management
Identity management can be deﬁned as the process of
managing users’ identity attributes [19]. Moreover, Hansen,
Schwartz and Cooper in [20] stated that identity management
systems are programs or frameworks that administer the collec-
tion, authentication, and use of identity and information linked
to identity. Thus, it provides means to create, manage and use
identities’ attributes.
Bertino and Takahashi in [21] presented the roles that exist
in an identity management system:
•
Users – entities that want to access some kind of
service or resource;
•
Identity – set of attributes that can be used to rep-
resent a user, it is also called personally identiﬁable
information (PII);
•
Identity provider (IdP) – provide means to manage
users’ attributes. It delivers users’ PIIs to service
providers;
•
Service provider (SP) – delivers the resource/service
desired by a user. It delegates the process of authen-
tication to IdPs and usually is responsible for the
authorization process.
Therefore, identity management systems are the frame-
works, which enable users to properly manage their PIIs.
Thus, they enable users to access resources and services using
identiﬁcation data that is stored in identity providers, from
which a subset of the identiﬁcation attributes may be disclosed
to service providers.
In this context we also have the concept of federation,
which is deﬁne by Chadwick in [19] as an association of ser-
vice providers and identity providers. Furthermore, Orawiwat-
tanakul, Yamaji, Nakamura, Kataoka and Sonehara in [22] said
that a federation allows users to access resources in multiple
administrative domains (ADs) by initially authenticating with
their home AD instead of authenticating with the accessed one.
Therefore, identity federation is a set of standards and
technologies that enable the exchange of identities in a secure
way between diﬀerent administrative domains.
Shibboleth [23] is one of the tools that can be used to create
a federation; it uses Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) to exchange data between IdPs and SPs. In one hand,
it has an IdP module that is developed in Java and can cope
with distinct data repositories, such as databases, Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Central Authentication
Service (CAS). On the other hand, its SP module is developed
in C as a module for the Apache Web Server and it is used to
manage the access control of a protected resource.
Shibboleth [23] has a plug-in called uApprove.jp, which
is presented in [22] that provides users with some means to
manage PII disclosure and some feedback about the reasons
of the data collection. Figure 1 presents the Shibboleth’s with
its plug-in uApprove.jp work ﬂow. Each step is described as
follows:
Figure 1. Shibboleth + uApprove.jp workﬂow
1)
Unauthenticated users by means of a browser access
a protected resource;
2)
The service provider sends users to the discovery
service (DS) in which they have to choose an IdP
that has their attributes;
3)
Users submit to DS the IdP they are enrolled. The DS
starts the session initiators at the protected resource
and sends users to the selected IdP;
4)
IdP answers the request and presents users with a lo-
gin page in which they have to enter their credentials;
5)
Users present their credentials that are checked upon
the IdP database. If the authentication process ends
with success, the IdP presents users with SP’s terms
of usage (ToU), which users should read and accept;
6)
After the ToU acceptance, users are presented with
an attribute release page of uApprove.jp, which will
display user’s attributes from which the user can se-
lect/unselect the optional ones, accordingly to she/he
will.
7)
The IdP creates an assertion with the result of the
authentication and user’s attributes that were chosen

by the user to be disclosed, which is sent to the SP
through the users’ browser;
8)
With the authentication conﬁrmation and some PII
data the SP can deliberate about the resource delivery.
There are other tools that can be used to create federations
such as OpenAM and OpenId Connect. This paper uses Shib-
boleth for its widespread adoption in the academia and because
it is developed and maintained by the Internet 2 foundation as
a free open source framework to build federations.
III.
Related work
Switch in [24] developed a plugin to Shibboleth IdPs that
provides awareness of data disclosure when accessing some
resource/service. However, users cannot select which data is
going to be disclosed, the user has either to agree or disagree
with the PII dissemination.
Orawiwattanakul, Yamaji, Nakamura, Kataoka and Sone-
hara in [22] tackled the lack of control on PII disclosure
in cloud federations. It proposed an extension of [24] that
would enable users to select among all non-mandatory at-
tributes which ones they wish to disclose to the SP that is
being accessed. This way, it guarantees that data disclosure is
happening with user consent.
In a diﬀerent approach to deal with privacy in cloud,
S´anchez, Almenares, Arias, D´ıaz-S´anchez and Mar´ın in [8]
proposed a reputation protocol that weights the reputation of
entities in a federation in order to support data disclosure. This
way, users can check SPs reputations among the federation
before they send any data to it. It is also provided a way in
which users would have the ability to check what is being done
with their data, and based on that they could lower or increase
the provider reputation.
Betg´e-Brezetz,
Kamga,
Guy-Bertrand,
Mahmoud
and
Dupont in [25] addressed the cloud privacy and security issues
in which users send data to cloud providers without any
guarantee that it is going to be secured in a proper way. As
S´anchez, Almenares, Arias, D´ıaz-S´anchez and Mar´ın did in
[8], it was proposed a o deﬁne if a user trusts or not a cloud
provider and the level of trust. Based on how much the user
trusts the cloud provider, he/she could send data in plain text,
partially encrypted (encrypted with some metadata in plain
text) or fully encrypted to the cloud. It was also proposed a
package called PDE (Privacy Data Envelope) to carry users’
data to the cloud. That package could hold the data (encrypted
or not) with some policies that state how, where, by whom and
when that data can be used.
Works [8] and [25] suﬀer from the same problem, a SP
with a good reputation does not mean that it is not vulnerable
to attacks, and that it is taking all the required measures to
guarantee users privacy.
As an alternative to previous presented works, Chadwick
and Fatema in [26] addressed the lack of means to create
access policies for data stored in the cloud and the absence of
standards to apply such policies deﬁned not just by users, but
also, by countries where data is stored. It was proposed a series
of web services that would analyze policies that are uploaded
within the data before any action is executed. Therefore, once
an application receives a request to process some data, it should
consult the proposed web services if it can proceed with the
requested action.

Betg´e-Brezetz, Kamga, Dupont and Guesmi in [7] com-
bined the approached of reputation presented in [25] with
policies presented in [26]. Its proposal addresses privacy issues
of cloud computing in an end-to-end fashion way. It used stick
policies with the PDE proposed in [25] to carry all together
policies and data to the cloud. The proposal consists in adding
on cloud service providers points that evaluate those policies
before using the data, these points are called data protection
module (DPM), which would guarantee the evaluation of
deﬁned policies before any process is made with the data. It
is also deﬁned that the PDE containing the policies and data
would just be sent (processed, copied and stored) into cloud
nodes that have the DPMs modules deployed.
Works [7] and [26] experience the same problem, that is the
lack of guarantee that a provider is truly obeying the proposed
models. Users do not have means to check if the protection
modules were developed, deployed and are working properly.
Having presented the related works, we can categorize the
papers that were presented into the following properties:
•
Use of cryptography – use of cryptography to store
data at a provider;
•
Based on reputation – use of reputation to back up
users’ decision of which data and how it is sent to
SPs;
•
Use of Policies – policies that regulate how data is
used/disclosed at a provider;
•
Awareness of data disclosure – provide feedback to
make users aware of data dissemination;
•
Disclosure support – provide means to support users
when they are disseminating data from an IdP to a SP.
Table I matches the properties shown above with the ones
found in presented related works. Therefore, it can be noticed
that our proposal combines the properties found in related
works, striving to enhance the support and privacy in identity
providers.
IV.
Enhancing privacy on identity providers
This section discusses and presents the issues that are being
addressed. Thus, it introduces our proposals to tackle those
problems.
A. Privacy issues
There are legislations [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and guide-
lines create by Jansen and et al. [27] and Security Alliance in
[28] to address privacy issues that arise in information systems.
Those laws and standards aim to guarantee users rights over
their data. Furthermore, works [7] [8] [22] [24] [25] [26] tried
84
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-376-6
SECURWARE 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

to address some of the issues that exist when data is stored out
of users boundaries. However, there are still a lack of models
and mechanisms:
•
Lack of control over user’s PII – users do not have
eﬀective means to manage their data that is stored in
identity providers;
•
Disclosure support – as presented in a research by
Zhang and et al. in [29] people could not successfully
deﬁne their personal information disclosure policies.
Therefore, there should be created a way to support
users when they are disseminating PII information.
The lack of control that users have over their sensitive data
gets worse once they migrate to cloud services. As presented
by Mather, Kumaraswamy and Latif in [30], once organizations
have migrated to the cloud they lose control over their structure
used to host services. Moreover, Zhang and et al. discussed in
[31] that loss of control can lead to data leaks as a consequence
of curious/malicious system administrators of the underlying
structures.
B. Working with privacy in identity providers
Our proposal uses the concepts of privacy described by
Diaz and G¨urses [13], striving to minimize data disclosure and
provide means for users to eﬀectively control personal data
disclosure. Thus, it makes the ﬂow of data more transparent
providing users awareness of data dissemination.
In addition, users are responsible for data entered into IdPs,
which is then used to access some service provided by an
SP. Thus, users should have means to proper control data
disclosure, and that process must be improved to be more
transparent for its users.
Therefore, we extended the federation framework presented
earlier. In one hand, we added templates for data dissemination
to support users with the PII disclosure. On the other hand, we
used the cryptography approach to store PII data encrypted in
IdPs.
Our model is presented in Figure 2, users would enter their
PII data into IdP providers encrypted with some key, therefore,
the disclosure process had to be extended to allow users to
open the data they wish to disseminate. We propose that layer
of protection over the PII data, in order to make it harder to
access and disseminate that data without users’ awareness and
consent.
We also created a way in which users can send their
preferences for data dissemination to IdPs in order to ease
and secure the disclosure process. As pictured in Figure 2,
those preferences would be created as policies written in XML,
they would be drawn by entities such as security labs, privacy
commissioners and security experts of the area who hold the
knowledge of which data can cause more or less harm to users’
privacy if disclosed.
The process of data dissemination from IdPs to SPs was
extended to cope with our proposal of templates for data dis-
semination. The dissemination process has to use the proposed
templates to support users with data disclosure.
Therefore, our proposal adds new objects into the model
of identity management of the Shibboleth framework. Each
object and its role is described as follows:
Figure 2. Enhancing privacy on identity providers.
•
Template data dissemination (TDD) – it is the template
which users can get from entities that the user trust,
customize if needed (as Bob does in Figure 2) and en-
ter it into IdPs to help them manage their PIIs release.
It guides users throughout the disclosure process with
diﬀerent granular conﬁguration to diﬀerent SPs;
•
Cryptography Keys – are the keys used to encrypt and
decrypt users PII that is store in the IdP. Users would
encrypt their PIIs before sending them to IdPs with
Key I, and during a transaction when some PII data
is needed users would be asked to open that data with
key II in order to disseminate it to a SP.
The following subsections present the extensions that we
developed in order to make Shibboleth IdP and its uApprove.jp
plugin cope with our proposals. We divided the work into
addressing the loss of control on users PIIs and adding support
to users at the disclosure process.
1) Addressing the loss of control on users PIIs: Papers
[7] [31] [26] suggested that there could be curious/malicious
internal entities into providers (SP and IdP) with privileges and
technical means to harm users privacy. Therefore, we propose
to store users’ PIIs into IdPs encrypted in a way that just the
user can decrypt the data and use it.
We did not propose any way to deal with this situation at
the SP side at this moment. In one hand, because as argued
by Chadwick in [19] if the fair principles of data collection
and minimization are followed the SP will just receive a
pseudonym and some data that by themselves do not give any
hint about the user’s identity. On the other hand, because the
IdP concentrate all the sensitive information needed to link
a system user to a person. Furthermore, as presented by De
Capitani di Vimercati, Foresti and Samarati in [9], data per
se is not sensitive, what is sensitive is its association with an
identity.
We developed a tag library using Java Web technologies to
be used as a basic framework to create forms in which users
would enter their PII data as they usually do when creating an
account in some IdP system as shown in Figure 3. However,
the data that is sent to the IdP will be encrypted with some
key, just the password and the login would not be encrypted,
as they are needed to execute the authentication process.

(a) User’s public key.
(b) Key derivation from passphrase.
Figure 3. Privacy enhanced sign up forms for IdP.
The framework we developed gives the following options
to users when asking for a key:
•
Use a public key – the user can choose to enter a
public key that she/he already has as the key to encrypt
the PII data, as shown in Figure 3(a);
•
Use a pass-phrase – users can enter a pass-phrase that
is used to derive a pair of keys from which we take
the ﬁrst one and encrypted their data before sending
them to the IdP, as depicted in Figure 3(b).
Both of the aforementioned approaches are performed at
the client side, the user’s keys are never sent to the IdP
server. Thus, to encrypt the data at the client site we used the
web programming language Javascript with libraries Cryptico
[32] and pidCrypt [33] respectively when users desire to use
a passphrase or a public key to encrypt her/his data. Thus,
both libraries are based on the Javascript cryptography library
developed by Wu [34].
Our proposal inserts data into the IdP encrypted. Thereby,
(a) User’s private key.
(b) Key derivation from passphrase.
Figure 4. User decrypting data to send to SP.
we had to change the ﬂow of message presented in Figure 1,
hence the IdP would not have users’ PII in clear text anymore.
It was needed an extension to enable users to decrypt the data
that is going to be sent to SPs as pictured in Figure 4.
If the user selected to send data encrypted with a pass-
phrase or a public key, there will be some diﬀerence when we
decrypt the PII needed to send to the SP.
In one side, if users selected to encrypt data with a public
key, when the decryption is required we ask them for a private
key as depicted in Figure 4(a). On the other side, if they chose
to encrypt data with a key derived from a pass-phrase, we then
ask for the pass-phrase to derive the keys, from which we use
the second key generated to decrypt the data as pictured in
Figure 4(b).
2) Adding support to users at the disclosure process:
Birrell and Schneider discussed in [35] that the control of
PII dissemination can be inconvenient forcing users to de-
cide which data can be sent to which SP every time they
access a new service. Furthermore, Zhang and et al. in [29]
86
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-376-6
SECURWARE 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

demonstrated that users usually fail to successfully deﬁne their
data disclosure policies. Thus, Hansen, Schwartz and Cooper
in [20] argued that one single default setting would not suit
properly every user needs. Therefore, we proposed the use of
TDDs based on diﬀerent user types, this way, we could have
diﬀerent TDDs, enabling users to customize data disclosure in
a granular way. The TDDs developed in XML look like the
document presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Example of TDD
Thereby, we extended the Shibboleth IdP to use the TDDs
shown above. This way, when users reach the process of PII
disclosure, they will be presented with a page in which the
attributes to be disclosed will already be selected/deselected.
V.
Conclusion
While papers [8] [25] and [7] [26] tried to manage privacy
in the cloud respectively by assessing cloud service providers
reputation and creating sticky policies within data, our proposal
tackles the lack of control of users’ PIIs into IdPs and the
lack of support when disclosing PIIs to SPs, respectively
by encrypting PIIs into IdPs and using templates for data
dissemination to support users when disclosing data.
Our proposal avoids curious and malicious system admin-
istrators to gather users’ PII data without permission in IdPs. If
an administrator accesses the data repository she/he will not be
able to retrieve any relevant data about a user identity, hence,
that sensitive information will be encrypted.
Furthermore, our proposal is a lightweight extension on
top of Shibboleth identity provider and its uApprove.jp plugin,
which works transparently to SPs, thence, all of the extensions
were developed at the IdP. Moreover, once the proposal is
deployed it can prevent PII data leaks that cause identity theft
and the correlation of big data processing with a speciﬁc user’s
identity without her/his consent.
In addition, this paper focused on tackling some privacy
issues in identity providers, there are still issues to be dealt
with at the service provider side, such as means to control
attributes that were released from an IdP to a SP. Our proposal
of personas to manage the granular release of users PIIs has
the goal to lower the risks that arise with the dissemination of
certain combination of attributes. It does not protect privacy
by itself; users are still vulnerable to malicious SPs that may
collude to proﬁle a user identity in a federated environment.
Therefore, as a future works we intend to investigate means
to enforce users privacy in service providers.
As a next step to be taken in our research we will extend
the OpenId Connect federation protocol, in order to add our
proposals. The OpenId Connect protocol uses JSON instead of
SAML (XML), which makes it easier to use in mobile environ-
ments in which XML processing can become a problem. We
also intend to investigate the possibility to use web semantic
into our proposals, to ease the adaptation of systems already
developed and to decouple identity management models and
protocols from the technology aspect.
