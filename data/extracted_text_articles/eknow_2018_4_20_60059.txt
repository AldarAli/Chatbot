Abstract—A comprehensive assessment of publication data in 
the Knowledge Management domain was conducted. By using 
the related literature in the Science Citation Index (SCI) 
database from 1974 to 2017, a scientometric approach is used 
to quantitatively evaluate current research landscape and 
trend. This shows that Knowledge Management is in the 
growth period with a maturity of 87.22%, a total of 8121 
articles covering 113 countries/territories and the top 3 most 
productive countries are China, USA and England. There are 
4556 research institutes engaged in the research field of 
“Knowledge Management” and the top 3 most productive 
institutes are Islamic Azad University, Wuhan University of 
Technology and Harbin Institute of Technology.  Research 
hotspots, such as performance, system, innovation, firm, 
information technology, strategy, organization and ontology 
are shown in a keywords clustering mapping. In addition, 
keywords with the strongest citation burst, such as Expert 
System, 
Organizational 
Memory, 
Artificial 
Intelligence, 
Decision Support, Social Media, Big Data and Total Quality 
Management demonstrate the trends of this field. The result 
provides a dynamic view of the evolution of “Knowledge 
Management” research landscapes, hotspots and trends from 
various perspectives which may serve as a potential guide for 
future research.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Knowledge Management (KM) is the process of creating, 
sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information 
of an organization which has existed for more than 40 years 
as a research area [1]. KM is widely used in Management [2], 
Business Information [3], Science [4], Education [5], 
Engineering [6] and so on. 
In the recent years, scholars conducted a comprehensive 
review of the research in the field of knowledge management. 
Corso et al. [7] reviewed and described the different streams 
and approaches emerging in literature on knowledge 
management in product innovation. Liao [8] surveyed and 
classified KM technologies using seven categories as follows: 
KM framework, knowledge-based systems, data mining, 
information and communication technology, artificial 
intelligence/expert systems, database technology, and 
modeling, together with their applications for different 
research and problem domains. Chen et al. [9] reviewed the 
development of knowledge management using a literature 
review and classification of articles from 1995 to 2004. 
Bjornson et al. [10]’s systematic review identifies empirical 
studies of knowledge management initiatives in software 
engineering, and discusses the concepts studied, the major 
findings, and the research methods used. Gallupe [11] 
surveyed the landscape of knowledge management system 
research and provided a framework for research into the 
development and use of these systems in organizations. 
Marra et al. [12] debated on the role of knowledge 
management in supply chain management by reviewing the 
published literature. Durst et al. [13] reviewed research on 
knowledge management in small and medium-sized 
enterprises to identify gaps in the body of knowledge. 
In this paper, a scientometric review of the landscape and 
trend of published knowledge management research is 
performed 
by 
investigating 
the 
scientific 
outputs, 
geographical distribution and international cooperation, 
distribution of institutions and journals with the aim to offer 
another perspective on the development of research in the 
field of Knowledge Management. Moreover, innovative 
methods, such as co-citation analysis, keyword semantic 
clustering and burst detection were applied, which can 
vividly reveal the landscape and trends from various 
perspectives. 
  The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II, we present the data and methods used. Section III contains 
the results and discussion. WE conclude this work in Section 
IV. 
II. 
DATA AND METHOD 
A. Data Collection 
The bibliographic records used for analysis in this paper 
were collected from Web of Science (WoS) of Clarivate 
Analytics on November 15, 2017, and specific search 
strategy is as follows: 
Topics = “Knowledge Management*” 
Timespan = All years 
Databases = SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, 
CPCI-SSH, BKCI-S, BKCI-SSH, ESCI, CCR-EXPANDED, 
IC. 
The query resulted in 8121 bibliographic records. The 
whole records were then retrieved and downloaded for 
subsequent analysis. 
B. Methods 
After data collection, cleaning, conversion, deduplication 
and other operations, a basic analysis with regard to highly 
productive countries/territories and institutes, highly cited 
references and highly cited authors was conducted by 
Microsoft Excel. H-Index and other metrics were calculated

countries/territories, institutes, categories and keywords was 
conducted by the scientometric software CiteSpace [14] and 
VOSViewer [15] with the aim to identify the intellectual 
structure, 
hotspots 
and 
trends 
of 
the 
Knowledge 
Management research. Semantic clustering of keywords was 
conducted based on word2vec [16] and burst detection of 
keywords was conducted by the algorithm proposed by 
Kleinberg [17].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Scientific Outputs of Knowledge Management Research
Figure 1 shows the number of papers and maturity 
forecast between 1974 and 2017 in the field of Knowledge 
Management. The black curve is the annual number of 
article. The earliest published time is 1974. Henry [18] 
argued knowledge management as a new concern for public 
administration. From the curve, we found that a substantial 
interest in Knowledge Management research did not emerge 
until 2002, although a few articles related to Knowledge 
Management were published previously. The highest number 
of papers arrived at 2009, with 671 articles, accounting for 
8.26% of the total number and the average number of articles 
was 193.4 per year. The red curve is the cumulative number 
of papers. According to the theory of technology maturity, 
the cumulative number of documents could be fitted by the 
Logistic Growth Model [19]. The least squares method for 
curve fitting is used to get the parameters in the equation, 
where the blue curve is the result which is described by (1). 
 y = 9196 / (1 + exp551.3014-0.27427x)      
   (1) 
Here, x and y denote the year and article number, 
respectively. According to this, we can divide the 
development of Knowledge into four stages: infant period 
(before 2002), growth period (2003-2018), mature period 
(2019-2024) and stable period (after 2024). According to the 
above 
stage 
division, 
the 
research 
of 
Knowledge 
Management in 2017 was in the growth period with a 
maturity of 87.22%. 
B.
Characteristics of Geographic Distribution
Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of countries/
territories in the field of Knowledge Management which was 
generated 
from 
author 
affiliations. 
One 
obvious 
characteristic is that these research institutes are mainly 
located in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia and 
Australia. Institutes in Europe are mainly located in the 
western region containing countries such as Great Britain, 
France, Germany and Italy. Countries in North America are 
mainly represented by the US. Institutes in Southeast Asia 
are mainly located in China (Mainland), South Korea, 
Taiwan (Territory) and Japan. 
Table I lists the top ten most productive countries/ 
territories in the field of Knowledge Management. Overall, 
China is the first most productive, but fifth most influential 
country in this field, with a total number of 1315 papers 
(1204 independent papers, 111 internationally collaborated 
papers), 235 institutes and 2755 citations. Its top five most 
productive institutes are Wuhan University of Technology 
(54 papers), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (50 
papers), Wuhan University (48 papers), Harbin Institute of 
Technology (44 papers) and Chinese Academy of Sciences

International Collaborations
In order to vividly show the collaboration between 
countries/ territories, a network was generated by the 
VOSViewer (Figure 3). The size of the node represents the 
number of documents, while the color indicates the number 
of times the node is referenced. In total, there are 113 
countries/territories in the field of Knowledge Management. 
As can be seen, the major contribution of the total output 
mainly came from three countries, namely, China, USA and 
England. In order to find the most influential countries in the 
field, we use the "Burst Detection Algorithm" in CiteSpace 
to detect the surge in research interest within KM research, 
and ten countries are found to have citation bursts: USA 
(119.4374), China (64.0792), Indonesia (29.3474), Germany 
(24.4142), England (22.4903), Romania (16.0049), India 
(14.8139), Colombia  (14.6504), Poland (13.4845), Australia 
(12.5315), suggesting that they have abrupt increases of 
interest in the research of Knowledge Management. 
Betweenness Centrality metrics provide a computational 
method for finding pivotal points between different 
specialties or tipping points in an evolving network [14]. 
Thus, high betweenness centrality nodes such as USA, 
Australia, Spain, England indicates that these countries play 
an important role in this research filed.

Overall, a total of 4556 research institutes in the world 
were engaged in Knowledge Management during the period 
1974 to 2017. Figure 4 shows the cooperation network of the 
institutes. In order to show the core institutions of this field, 
we filter out the institutions with a small number of 
publications and get an institute co-occurring network with 
256 nodes and 342 links. Obviously, Islamic Azad 
University takes the first place with a frequency of 75 
articles. In second place is Wuhan University of Technology 
with a frequency of 46 articles. We also notice that China’s 
other institutes, such as Harbin Institute of Technology, The 
Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Wuhan University and 
Chinese Academy of Sciences were also on the top of the list. 
The nodes in the network with red colors are the institutes 
with strong citation bursts. Obviously, thirteen institutes are 
found to have citation bursts: Harbin Institute of Technology

Journal Distribution and Co-occurring Network
The distribution of the Journals in the field of Knowledge 
Management was displayed in Figure 5. Overall, Journal of 
Knowledge Management is the most productive one, with a 
total of 168 papers and 2609 citations, followed by 
Knowledge Management Research & Practice (77 papers, 
434 citations), Expert Systems with Applications (67 papers, 
2869 citations), International Journal of Information 
Management (55 papers, 1399 citations) and so on. We can 
also conclude that Expert Systems with Applications is the 
most influential journal, though it has only 67 papers. In 
order to show the relationship between institutes, a network 
of co-occurring was generated by VOSViewer and was 
displayed in Figure 6. Overall, there are 3255 journals in this 
field and the largest connected component consists of 1710 
nodes accounting for a half part of the total nodes, indicating 
that relationship of journal in this area is getting closer and 
closer.

in different fields with the aim to identifying the important 
areas for research. Andrew et al. [22] discussed the 
Knowledge Management from the organizational capabilities 
perspective through analysis of surveys collected from over 
300 senior executives which provide a basis for 
understanding the competitive predisposition of a firm as it 
enters a program of knowledge management. Davenport et al. 
[23] examined the differences and similarities of thirty-one
knowledge management projects. Sanchez et al. [24]
researched the modularity, flexibility, and knowledge
management in product and organization design. Hedlung
[25] developed a model of knowledge management and the
n-form corporation which was built on the interplay between
articulated and tacit knowledge at four different. Lee et al.
[26] discussed knowledge management enablers, processes,
and organizational performance from an integrative view and
empirical examination which can be used as a stepping stone
for further empirical research and can help formulate robust
strategies that involve tradeoffs between knowledge
management enablers. Long et al. [27] diagnosed cultural
barriers to knowledge management and concluded four
perspectives. Ruggles [28] discussed the state of the notion 
about Knowledge Management in practice. Earl [29] drew on 
primary and secondary data to propose a taxonomy of 
strategies, or “schools” for knowledge management with the 
aim to guide executives on choice to Initiate KM Projects. 
Madhavan et al. [30] used the notions of tacit knowledge and 
distributed cognition as a basis to elaborate that the T-shaped 
skills, shared mental models, and new product development 
(NPD) routines of team members, as well as the A-shaped 
skills of the team leader, are key design variables when 
creating NPD teams. 
In order to find the research landscape about Knowledge 
Management 
in 
detail, 
a 
keyword 
clustering 
and 
visualization method based on word2vec [16] was used, and 
Figure 10 shows the result of such method. Each peak in the 
figure represents a keyword or topic in the field. The 
distance between peaks is determined by the semantic 
similarity between them, and the height of the peaks 
indicates the importance of the keywords which can be 
calculated by indicators such as frequency, betweenness 
centrality and so on. Here, the frequency was chosen as the
