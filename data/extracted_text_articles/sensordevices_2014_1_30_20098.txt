Abstract—The resistance of platinum thin-film was reduced by 
carrier density increment in the presence of hydrogen gas. The 
resistance change depended on the thickness of the platinum. 
Using these phenomena, a bridge-type hydrogen sensor, which 
converted this resistance change into a voltage change, was 
developed. The developed sensor was able to detect hydrogen 
at room temperature. Furthermore, we suggest a method in 
which the response and recovery time is accelerated by 
applying a pulse voltage to the sensor. The developed sensor 
can use DC and AC voltage as the driving power source.

 INTRODUCTION  
A large amount of energy is being consumed and fossil 
fuel is mainly used as the energy resource. However, the use 
of fossil fuel is exacerbating the greenhouse effect and there 
is a finite supply of fossil fuel. Therefore, a new energy 
resource as an alternative to fossil fuel is required. Recently, 
hydrogen has been attracting attention as a new source of 
energy. However, when the concentration of hydrogen is 
more than 4.1%, it is liable to explode. Therefore, the 
development of a hydrogen sensor that can detect low 
concentrations of hydrogen is required. Several types of 
hydrogen sensor have been reported, including those based 
on catalytic, thermal conductivity, electrochemical reaction, 
resistance change, work function change and optical change 
[1]-[10]. A metallic resistance change type sensor (resistance 
based) can operate at room temperature and the structure of 
this sensor is simple. Generally, this hydrogen sensor uses 
Palladium (Pd) as the hydrogen storage metal. While Pd has 
a good response toward hydrogen, its durability is weak. To 
address this issue, we developed a hydrogen sensor using 
Platinum (Pt) instead of Pd [11] and the resistance of the Pt 
thin-film was reduced by the carrier density increment in the 
presence of hydrogen gas. Moreover, it was clarified that the 
resistance change depended on the thickness of the Pt [12] 
because of the carrier density change caused at only the Pt 
surface. To develop a practicable hydrogen sensor made of 
Pt thin-film, a bridge circuit using four Pt thin-film 
resistances was investigated. It is advantageous that the 
bridge circuit sensor can reduce environmental noise and off-
set signal. Moreover, it can convert resistance change to 
voltage change and can detect hydrogen concentration by 
voltage change. In this study, two bride types of sensor, 
which consist of one or two hydrogen sensitive thin-film 
resistances (Type 1 and Type 2), were developed. Then, the 
hydrogen response of these two sensors was evaluated. 
Moreover, the effect of pulse voltage applied to the sensor 
was investigated in order to improve the response and 
recovery time (time taken to achieve a 90% response to a 
step change). Section II describes schematic of sensing chip 
and experimental procedure. Section III describes the result 
and discussion. Section IV addresses the conclusion.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
A. Schematic of sensing chip 
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the sensing chip. 
The sensing area consists of four resistances (R1 – R4) and 
these resistances can be regarded as a bridge circuit. In this 
study, two types of thin film having different resistances, 
were fabricated. When the sensor is exposed to hydrogen, 
the thin layer, which has high resistance, is greatly reduced 
and the thick layer, which has low resistance, decreases 
slightly.

Therefore, the resistance change can be measured by the 
bridge circuit and this resistance change depends on the 
hydrogen concentration. The whole sensor is 3 mm × 5 mm, 
and each resistance size is 0.5 mm × 0.1 mm. This sensor can 
also reduce environmental noise using the same material.  
B. Production procedure of sensing chip 
Figure 2 shows the production procedure of this sensor. 
First, glass substrate is cleaned by ultrasonic cleaning in 
acetone and ethanol alternately. Next, the surface of the glass 
substrate is coated by photoresist using a spin coating 
machine and baked for 90 s at 110 °C. After that, the glass 
substrate is irradiated with ultraviolet rays through a mask 
pattern of the circuit and immersed in a developer solution. 
Subsequently, the glass substrate is baked in 5 min at 60 °C 
and a metal film is deposited on glass substrate by sputtering. 
Finally, the fabricated circuit is cleaned by ultrasonic 
cleaning. From the above procedure, only metal remains on 
the circuit (Figure 1 (a) ~ (f)).These processes are repeated 
three times. In the first process, an electrode layer is formed 
by titanium (Ti) (50 nm) (Figure 1 (1)). Next, the reaction 
layer is formed by Pt (5 nm) on Ti (3 nm) (Figure 1 (2), (3)). 
Finally, the low reaction layer is formed by Pt (20 nm) 
(Figure 1 (4)). In this study, two types of bridge sensor, Type 
1 and 2, were fabricated as shown in Table 1.

C. Measurement condition 
The hydrogen sensor must be able to detect a hydrogen 
concentration of less than 4.1% because the hydrogen 
concentration range of explosion is between 4.1% and 74.2%. 
In this study, gases of air (80%-nitrogen and 20% oxygen) 
and 1%-H2 (1%-hydrogen and 99%-air gas) were prepared in 
order to evaluate the hydrogen response. Three volts are 
applied to input terminals (Figure 1 (b)-(d)) of the sensor as 
the driving power source. Then, when gases are injected into 
the chamber for 5 minutes alternately, the voltage between 
the output terminals (Figure 1 (a)-(c)) is measured. When 
DC voltage is applied to the sensor as the driving power 
source, the wiring affects the output. To reduce the effect of 
the wiring, AC voltage (6Vp-p, 1Hz) is applied to two 
terminals (Figure 1 (b)-(d)) of the sensor as the driving 
power source. In this case, the terminal voltage of the other 
two terminals (Figure 1 (a)-(c)) is measured as well as the 
DC measurement.  
D. Improvement of response time 
The conventional hydrogen sensor has the problem of 
slow response time. In this study, in order to accelerate the 
response time, it was attempted to accelerate the reaction by 
increasing the temperature of the sensor. Therefore, pulse 
voltage (40 V) was applied to the sensor for 3 s. As 
mentioned above, the gas is changed from air gas to 1%-H2 
gas to fill the chamber with 1%-H2 and the pulse voltage is 
applied to the sensor to reduce the response time by 30 s 
after changing the gas (waiting time to fill gas). In the same 
way, the pulse voltage is also applied to the sensor to reduce 
the recovery time as well as the response time by 30 s after 
changing the switch from H2-1% gas to the air gas to fill the 
chamber with the air gas. 
III. 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 3 shows the hydrogen response of the developed 
sensor using DC measurement. Output of Type 1 and Type 2 
increased in the presence of hydrogen gas. Here, R1, R2 and 
R4 of Type 1 are the same because the film thickness is the 
same. Therefore, the output of E is given by (1). 

    EEi (R2 – R3)] / [2(R2 + R3)]    
Moreover, in the case of Type 2, R1 is equal to R3, and R2 is 
equal to R4 because the film thickness is the same. 
Consequently, the output voltage is given by (2)

When the sensor is exposed to the hydrogen gas, R2 (Pt/Ti 
=20 nm/3 nm) and R3 (Pt/Ti = 5 nm/3 nm) are reduced by 
carrier density increment. Moreover, the resistance change 
depends on the thickness of the platinum. The results of 
reference [12] show that Pt/Ti (20 nm/3 nm) decreased 0.14 
Ω and Pt/Ti (5 nm/3 nm) decreased 5.8 Ω. Therefore, the 
output increased because the change of R2 and R3 is different. 
Compared with Type 1, output of Type 2 is larger. Type 2 is 
useful as a sensor. As for the response time, the 90% 
response time in the case of no pulse voltage was about 210 s. 
When the pulse voltage is applied, the total response time 
and waiting time (30 s) is about 50 s. After pulse voltage is 
applied, the output becomes saturated in 20 s because high 
voltage was applied to the sensor and the temperature of the 
sensor increased by joule heat. Moreover, the recovery time 
is more than 12 h when the pulse voltage is not applied. 
However, when the pulse voltage is applied, total recovery 
time and waiting time (30 s) is about 50 s. After the pulse 
voltage is applied, the output became about 0 V and was 
saturated in 20 s. The reason for accelerating the response 
and recovery time is described below.  
This sensor uses the chemical change of (3), (4). 
        H2 ⇄ 2H+  + 2e-        

      4H+ + O2- + 2e- ⇄ 2H2O     
Therefore, heating a sensor is a simple method of increasing 
the speed of the reaction rate.  The Arrhenius equation (5) 
shows the reason for this, 
         k = A×exp (-Ea/RT)      
where k, A, Ea, R, T are the rate constant, constant, 
activation energy, gas constant, and absolute temperature, 
respectively. The more T is increased by heating and the k of 
(5) is increased, the greater the reaction of (3), (4) is 
accelerated. For these reasons, the response and recovery 
times are accelerated. Therefore, the pulse voltage 
application is useful for accelerating the response. Moreover, 
in this study, the sensor is heated by pulse voltage only when 
the heating is required. In such a way, power consumption 
can be reduced. Figure 4 (a) shows the hydrogen response of 
the developed sensor using AC measurement. As shown in 
Figure 4 (a), it is difficult to show the hydrogen response 
because of the offset effect. To solve this problem, the 
instrumentation amplifier (AD627AN) was used. The offset 
is canceled by the antiphase of the sensor output. The gain of 
instrumentation amplifier is 5. Figure 4 (b) shows the 
hydrogen response of 
AC 
measurement 
using 
the 
instrumentation amplifier. The output increased by the 
presence of hydrogen gas and the hydrogen response could 
be detected clearly. Moreover, the response and recovery 
time is accelerated, as well as the use of DC voltage as the 
driving power source.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
A bridge circuit type hydrogen sensor was developed 
utilizing the principle of electrical resistance change in Pt 
thin-film. This sensor can detect hydrogen concentration at 
room temperature. In addition, DC and AC voltage was used 
as the driving power source and the voltage change caused 
by the hydrogen sensor was detected when using AC voltage, 
which can reduce the effect of the wiring. Moreover, the 
response and recovery times became shorter by applying 
pulse voltage to the sensor. In future research, the developed 
sensor will be evaluated under various condition to apply to 
practical use such as hydrogen station and fuel cell vehicles.
