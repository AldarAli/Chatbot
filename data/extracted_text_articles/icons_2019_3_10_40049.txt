Abstract—
An image histogram is a set of
parameters
commonly used to automatically evaluate the image during
processing or recognition. When comparing or classifying
different images, the histogram data can be analysed as it
presents the overall colour or intensity composition of the
image. This is very important in case of texture classification as
the system must provide sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we
present an approach and algorithm for visual analysis of
images
with
different
histograms,
which
can
be
easily
implemented
as
a
software
application,
improving
substantially the image classification after non-destructive
testing of vehicle tire’s sidewall. The main contribution of this
work is a software product for automated defect detection
against a series of images, generated by laser shearography in
a tire factory.

INTRODUCTION
Histogram analysis [4] is often used to automatically
evaluate an image during its recognition process.
Previous researches show that it is possible to use the
histogram
of
grayscale
images
generated
by
laser
shearography [6] for non-destructive testing of vehicle tires,
together
with
Multi-Layer
Perceptron
neural
network
assisted calculations for pattern classification [3]. After
further
analysis,
that
method
demonstrated
some
disadvantages, as some of the textures, which have obvious
defects, were skipped while others, being part of the non-
affected surface, were highlighted as defects. Also, another
finding was that some of the images’ histograms were
identical due to similar samples (same model tires) in the
automated shearography approach. Even if the position of a
pixel or a set of pixels within the image is changed, the
histogram will remain the same. That problem created the
need to introduce a new flexible approach. The basic
requirements led to the implementation of an algorithmic
type, allowing parallel calculations and processing as well as
high performance, even with limited hardware resources.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we present the algorithm step by step. An example of
detected defects in images of tire carcasses is included. The
conclusions and comparison with another approach for
pattern recognition are presented in Section 3.

DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD
The analyzed image color pattern is in grayscale. Initial
conversion to 8 color grayscale takes place to additionally
optimize the calculations. Each single pixel has a color code
and is described by an elementary random event. All
elementary random events 1, 2, …. , b generate an event
sequence with length b, where b is the number of all different
color codes discovered within the given image. For example:
If the different codes are 1 = 0, 2 = 32, s3 = 64, 4 = 96,
5 = 128, 6 = 160, 7 = 192, 8 = 224, then b=8.
Sequences of k simple events are introduced and each
sequence allows recurrence. The relocation of two simple
events will cause the production of a new sequence. A
number collates to each sequence
(1)
where i = i, i = 1,… k.
Introduction
of
the
unique
sequence
outlines
the
dependency between all simple random events, which can be
described
simultaneously
by
relation,
regression
and
correlation between simple random events.
Considering the above definitions, we can present the
image as a row vector of all simple random events.
Following (1), starting from left to right and using a step
with length 1 (single simple random event) and for pre-
selected k-tuples, we calculate a number that corresponds to
a class in the histogram. That is how the frequencies of the
selected k-tuples are defined.
Figure 1 shows an image of a vehicle tire, the result of
non-destructive control based on laser shearography, after
initial conversion to 8 color grayscale. The image size is
64x64 pixels.

Zone of defect
Figure 1. 64x64 pixels image, representing defect in vehicle tire
carcass based on laser shearography.
For Figure 1, it was calculated that 1 = 0, 2 = 32, 3 =
64, 4 = 96, 5 = 128, 6 = 160, 7 = 192, 8 = 224 and
b=8. The 2-tuples (k=2) are taken into consideration, which
generates bk classes, or 64 classes in the given example.
The histogram is calculated according to (1) and is
illustrated in Figure 3.
An approach for generation of an arranged dataset based
on the pixel information (symbols) is to scan the image in
predefined direction (i.e. rows and columns) and to generate
an array of k consecutive symbols – the so called “k-tuples”.
After all k-tuples are generated, their histogram can be
calculated for subsequent classification analysis. Figure 2
presents the process of generating the k-tuples; if k=3, the
scan step is 1 and the directions is a row, followed by a
column.

The same process with k=3 is shown in Figure 4.

The histogram in Figure 3 shows the frequency of
appearance of separate 2-tuples within the image and gives
an opportunity for the initial image preparation to take place.
It is known that the optimal selection of classes in a given
histogram defines the expected frequency of a class between
N(2/5) – N(3/5), where N is the count of the simple random
events (N=4096 for the current example) [1]. That is why
N=147 is chosen.
All the classes from Figure 2 meeting the above
requirement and having a count less than 147 are presented
in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Selected pixels for N=147
Figure 5 shows the pixels of the classes with frequencies
less than N.
The dependency between simple random events is
defined by calculating the relation, regression and correlation
between them. The definitions of relation, regression and
correlation are given in [2].
The
relation
between
simple
random
events
is
calculated by the sections P [2]:

Figure 6 illustrates the relation between simple random
events, as per Figure 2.

(2) and (3) for the selected pixels, shown in Figure 5
A limiting constant (1/64) is selected. The constant is
defined by the number of the classes – 82. In this way, each
random event’s probability is 1/64. If random events are
equipropable, then the relation between them is going to be
0, according to (2). So, the classes with relation less than
1/64 are selected and the results are displayed in Figure 7.

the image, shown in Figure 1.
The coefficient of regression R of a simple random event
according to the simple random event
is defined as a
difference between conditional probabilities following (4)
[2].

Condition (3) of asymmetry defines that there are two
ways to calculate R, against indexes i and j. The numeric
values are shown in Figure 8.

relations, presented in Figure 7
A limiting constant (1/39) greater than (1/64) empirically
is used for the examined set of images.
In Figure 9 are displayed the classes having regression
coefficient less than (1/39).

CONCLUSIONS
The described method has been applied to over 50
grayscale
images,
result
of
shearography
based,
nondestructive testing in a tire factory. The number of the
detected defects was 50 (100%), which proves the approach
as reliable for detecting defects or abnormal differences in
the texture (of the tire carcass). Compared to the X-ray
based approach presented in [7], it proves its effectiveness
and
simple
implementation,
eliminating
the
potential
endless loop if different types of defects exist in a single
image. The proposed method can distinguish two or more
visually different images with same histograms. Also, the
required user decisions and manual interventions, that can
potentially cause errors, are less than in the approach given
in [7].
Due to its algorithmic structure, it was implemented
easily as an experimental software and demonstrated fast
processing combined with satisfactory results. It is robust
against images with identical or similar histograms due to
the
implementation
of
the
unique
sequence
logic.
Potentially, the approach can be applied to all kinds of
textures in grayscale images and its further development can
be beneficial. As a future improvement, it could be
beneficial the calculations to be executed over Graphics
Processing Unit [5], to increase the parallel processes
handling capabilities. The defining of the limiting constant,
based on the user’s expectation, is a weakness of the method
and something that will be researched further. Future
researches
and
development
should
include
a
wider
overview of the most recent approaches applied to pattern
classification in images, resulted of nondestructive testing.
