Abstract—The  emergent  blockchain  technology  has  become
even more widely used in various areas, apart from financing,
where bitcoin is already a great success. Fully secure, highly
available and with many consensus algorithms on the network,
the use of this technology, as well as any emergent one, offers
challenges and opportunities that need to be explored. This
paper  proposes  a  systematic  mapping  of  challenges,
opportunities and common problems in many areas.

 INTRODUCTION 
From a survey developed by Mettler [1], it was identified
that until 2025, about 10% the Gross National Product will
be provided from the use of blockchain technology. That was
an important data to encourage big companies to invest more
than  half  billion  dollars  in  2015,  in  search  for  new
approaches  and challenges  to using this technology. The
great  interest  in  blockchain  is  due  to  the  fact  that  it
withstands a safe and distributed network with inviolable
lodgers, as well as the fact that there is no authorized dealer
[2] that interferes in the result and data control.  
 
Blockchain technology has been drawing attention in the
market because of its good acceptance with cryptocurrency,
such as bitcoin. It is an electronic payment system peer-to-
peer in which the algorithm proof-to-work is used to ensure
an irreversible transaction history [2]. Several areas, such as
healthcare [34][39], IoT [5][10], chain of supplies [16][17],
energy [6] and public sector [18][41] are developing cases of
use  with  blockchain  technology  to  create  new  business
opportunity, decrease  of  costs, audit  data,  integrate  with
stakeholders basis, improve generation process and increase
security of transmitted data.   
 
However,  with  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  in
projects,  challenges,  problems,  characteristics  and
opportunities appear in the analysis of the pre-project or
during the development through blockchain technology in
projects. 
According  to  Nakamoto  [2],  blockchain  is  a  public
distributed timestamp server that registers every transaction
that happens and allows data storage, verification and audit
of those. Blockchain consists in an array of blocks composed
of many transactions and every block is linked to another, as
a chained list. The authenticity to each transaction is verified
by a digital signature based in Elliptic Curve Cryptography
(ECC).
Another concept to be considered is the use of smart
contract.  They  are  customized  scripts  that  perform  the
necessary  logic  to  provide  a  complex  service,  like
management  of  state  and  controlling  verification  of
credentials [26]. It contains the business logics that may
interact with other contracts, make decisions, store data and
send cryptocurrency to another recipient [7].
This paper  aims to answer  these  questionings in the
context of adopting this technology in projects. 
This study is divided in 4 sections. In the first one, it will
be  explained  how  the  blockchain  technology  works.  In
Section 2, it will be explained how the research protocol will
be developed. In Section 3 a thorough examination will be
carried out from primary studies. Finally, the conclusion will
be in the fourth section.
II.
PROTOCOL APPLICATION
Based  on  Kitchenham’s  work  [4],  a  well-defined
outlining protocol stage is necessary to reduce the researcher
bias. The following protocol was divided in stages. In the
first one, it was made a main survey question with secondary
ones, aiming a broader research. The second stage is the
criteria  protocol  definition  for  insertion  or  exclusion  of
papers. The third stage is the application of primary studies
selection  protocol.  The  fourth  stage  will  be  checklist
generation in order to verify research quality. The fifth and
last stage will be the analysis whether the present research is
relevant. 
A.
Survey Questions

How  to  analyze  the  viability  of  blockchain  in
projects?
 
 From  the  main  survey,  secondary  questions  were
formulated with the aim of helping understand the problem.

Which challenges and opportunities are there with
blockchain solutions?

Which  characteristics  are  more  present  in
blockchain solutions?

Which are the most common problems found in
blockchain projects?
B.
Insertion and Exclusion Criteria
In  order  to  reduce  researcher  bias,  it  was  created  a
criterion through a well-defined protocol. For this research,
91

ICSEA 2019 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

only  studies  which  aim  to  present  characteristics  and
challenges  in  the  adoption  of  blockchain  technology  in
projects will be considered. This systematic mapping will be
limited to verify studies which were published from 2016 on.
The following exclusion criteria were used.

Studies not published in English.

Studies which are unavailable online.

Studies  not  based  on  this  present  research  or
unpublished.

Preface, brochure, interviews and reports.
C.
Search Strategy
The following virtual libraries were used:
•
IEEE Xplore;
•
Sciencedirect;
•
ACM DL
Combinations of strings were created to guarantee that
relevant information would not be excluded when querying
different search engines and databases. As a result, three
search strings were created
•
((blockchain  AND  challenges)  OR  (blockchain
AND opportunity));
•
((blockchain) AND (solution OR characteristics OR
application));
•
((blockchain) AND issues);
With the creation of search strings in each virtual library,
the option advanced search was used on September 30th,
2018 and some papers published from January 2016 until
2018 were included. The result of each respective digital
library, which  were  later  removed  to avoid duplicate  of
papers by Mendeley tool, was grouped according to their
respective virtual library as shown in Table 1.
TABLE I. 
THE AMOUNT OF STUDIES FOUND IN EACH
VIRTUAL LIBRARY
Library
Number of articles
IEEE Xplore
1001
Science Direct

ACM DL
183
The  combination  of  strings  showed  a  result  of  183
research articles from Science Directory Library. In IEEE
Xplorer there, were a total of 1001 research articles. Finally,
the ACM DL Library generated 104 papers as shown in
Table 1.
D.
Choice of Studies Process 
In this section, the process of choice of primary research
articles will be outlined by using a protocol of insertion and
exclusion.
In the first stage, 1288 research articles were found from
virtual libraries. After the removal of duplicates, there were
906 distinct files left. For this process, Mendeley software
was used along with Zotero.
Within the developed protocol, in the second stage, each
research article was verified whether they were in the context
of the research or not, with the analysis of artefacts titles.
However, certain studies, after a thorough analysis of
titles, could not be conclusive regarding their relevance to
this study. Due to that, a third stage was added: abstract
verification.
In the fourth stage, the introduction and conclusion of the
work were analyzed to verify relevance of the state of art
approached in this paper.
Lastly, a  qualitative  analysis  will  be  made  from  the
reading of all articles left, excluding, this way, artefacts that
are not relevant to this research. 
After the execution of the stages of the protocol, 1249
studies  were  removed,  and  a  total  of  39  artefacts  were
analyzed. 
E.
Quality Control
In order to evaluate this research quality, it is necessary
the primary studies to be analyzed critically. All in all, a
protocol  was  developed  and  executed  to  minimize  the
amount of initial studies. Based on that, a following stage
was deemed necessary, in which, it was made the reading of
the research  articles.  Six  secondary  questions were  then
created with the purpose of evaluating the credibility and
relevance of each artefact.
The three initial questions were used to investigate how
blockchain technology is generally being used in projects, as
criteria for excluding unrelated artefacts. The other questions
were used to evaluate if the paper approaches themes that
add value to the use of blockchain in projects, as well as if
the paper found does not approach only blockchain.
The questions that will help assess the quality of the
research are:
1.
Were  the  challenges  and  opportunities  of
blockchain technology use clear in the article?
2.
Were the characteristics of blockchain technology
well-approached in the research?
3.
Were the common problems with the blockchain
approached?
4.
Was a survey developed with the user about the
implementation of blockchain project?
5.
Was  the  article  not  restricted  to  just  discussing
blockchain?
6.
Does the paper make an analogy of the use of
blockchain adding value in the final product?
After the analysis and extraction of articles chosen, based
on the protocol, there were a total of 39 files left, which were
approved  in  the  quality  control.  The  process  of  quality
control will be explained in the next section. It will focus in
remaining 39 artefacts.
III. RESULTS
Based on the execution of the developed protocol, 39
primary studies were selected [2] and [4] – [41]. It was
92

identified  the  use  of  blockchain  in  different  areas,  as
described below.
According  to  the  selected  primary  studies,  it  was
observed  a  higher  demand  in  the  use  of  blockchain
technology  in  the  IoT,  healthcare,  cryptocurrency,
government, energy and voting, respectively.
In the next section, a quantitative and qualitative analysis
of the primary studies was held.
A.
Quantitative Analysis
The research showed a total of 39 primary researches by
126 different authors and they were published from 2016 to
2018.  It was identified a total of 229 keywords related to
blockchain.
In regards to frequency of publishing, it had a growth of
interest  for  blockchain’s.  In  2016,  it  had  2  publishing.
followed by 17 in 2017 and 20 in 2018. The large amount of
publishing across the years show up a huge interessing for
blockchain.
From the primary studies, the interest in blockchain was
identified in the areas  of IoT, healthcare,  supply chains,
government, big data, design, cloud computing and digital
property. 
Among 39 primary articles found, 229 keywords were
found. The most found keywords were: internet of things (7),
bitcoin (5),  iot  (4), government  (4),  smart  contracts  (6),
cryptocurrency (3), iot security (3), cloud computing (3),
trust  (3),  decentralized  iot  (2),  consensus  protocols  (2),
blockchain challenges (2), voting (2), food safety (2), data
integration  (2),  egovernment  (2),  finance  (2),  distributed
ledger (2), business (2), voter (1), big data (1), food chain
(1), and smart agriculture (1).
It has been observed with keywords in the research that
the use of blockchain can be applied in diverse areas that go
beyond Nakamoto [1] in cryptocurrency. That is a fact of
relevance to this research.
B.
Qualitative Analysis
The result of the qualitative analysis will be displayed in
this  section  from  39  primary  studies,  taking  into
consideration  six  criteria,  to  evaluate  the  credibility  and
quality of the studies. The classification of artefacts will be
either  positive  (1)  or  negative  (0)  and  there  will  be  a
reference to the article.

Based on the results as shown in Table 2 it was observed
from the first question, there is, indeed, a great tendency for
blockchain use to generate opportunities and challenges in
many areas. Among the 39 selected articles, 28 described
that the characteristics of the use of blockchain can help in
projects. Analyzing the third question, related to common
problems, the primary articles showed high rate of problems
in the adoption of blockchain in projects. Analyzing the
result of the fourth question, it was observed that the use of
surveys was not relevant as a tool to support decision and
generate new opportunities. The fifth question is focused on
quality assessment, since it analyzes whether the articles are
restricted  to  describing  blockchain  only. Thus,  the  sixth
question is related  to verifying whether  blockchain  adds
value to the final product. In conclusion, from 39 selected
articles, 35 use blockchain as an addition to the final product.
 
IV.
DISCUSSION
The following subjects will be approached in the primary
studies according to the questions used in the quality control
assessment.  It  will  be  taken  into  account  the  studies
93

ICSEA 2019 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

involving IoT, government and healthcare, once these are the
most recurrent subjects.
1.   Which challenges and opportunities are there with 
blockchain solution?
In  IoT,  according  to  [5],  it  was  identified  that  the
blockchain network can help in Iot area to keep data safely
and immutable. This way, generating opportunity to track
data that was once generated by different devices. One of the
greatest challenges in integrating data generated by devices
and network is due to the fact that these devices have already
delivered corrupt data. Therefore, it is necessary that the
devices to be tested before is put in the network, besides of
being allotted, in order to avoid physical alteration. 
Reyna  et  al.  [5]  comments  about  the  value  that
blockchain brings, providing a network where information is
traceable, immutable and highly safe. In cases which the data
is provided by devices, blockchain will play an important
role integrating the parts.
Elsden et al.  says in his article [21] that the outcome of
the survey resulted in the use of blockchain in IoT, as a way
of keeping the devices interoperable and safe for sharing and
exchanging messages.
To the author Smith, the safety in IoT with integration in
blockchain networks is challenging due to the limitations in
processing,  being  necessary  a  smaller  precision  in  the
algorithm  proof-of-state,  used  on  the  network.   This
approach  can  generate  attacks  in  blocks  with  bigger
reputation, generating new blocks with invalid data. 
As  opportunity,  Kahn  and  Salah  [10]  defend  that
blockchain technology, based on smart contracts, can be used
to manage, control and, the most important, keep IoT devices
safe. Another point raised is the possibility of using a public
key of 160-bit form blockchain generated by Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature algorithm (EDCSA) instead of 128 bits
from IPV6. blockchain can generate and allocate addresses
offline for around 1.46  1048 IoT devices., removing needs
∗
of an entity internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
central authorizer of devices.
In  article  [26]  it  reports  that  the  possible  use  of
blockchain in the network can track millions of connected
devices,  process  transactions  and  coordinate  devices,
allowing  connection  peer-to-peer  to  send  messages  and
allowing  blockchain  to  control  the  devices  connected
through smart contracts.
Regarding healthcare,  Jiang et al. [39] verified that great
part of the products developed that used blockchain recorded
only data generated in EMR (electronic medical records),
ignoring data from PHD (personal healthcare data). In the
article  [13]  the  author  debates  the  necessity  of  not
manipulating data generated from EHRS (electronic health
records).  It  can  entail  manipulation  of  data,  and
consequently, problems to patients. 
The use of blockchain, along with smart contracts, will
help keep the integrity, safety and immutability of network
data. This way, a greater collaboration among hospitals and
clinics will help save 93 billion dollars in 5 years’ time in the
USA from the safe mass data sent from blockchain [13].
According to Mettler [1] the possibility to create a shared
infrastructure among researchers and doctors comes from
data generated by patients using blockchain. This will allow
further analysis of wasted resources, operational problems
and  improvement  of  user  service.  The  author  comments
about the challenges in patient’s data privacy, and about the
possibility to create a new platform, where users would be in
control of their data.
At  last,  there  is  an  opportunity  for  the  user  to  be
compensated  for  allowing  access  to  their  data  in  the
blockchain. Alhadhrami [36] exposes that the data privacy in
the blockchain network is a challenge due to public data.
Therefore, it is necessary to take some precautions in the
moment of sending data to the network. In article [26] it
comment about the opportunity of using public blockchain as
a way of centralizing data from patients with the challenge of
patronizing the data inserted. 
In government, Antipova [32] describes the opportunity
of using blockchain to help audit data, removing the need for
a centralizing entity and avoid fraud, since these transactions
in the network are inviolable. 
There are challenges in the area of public blockchain.
The  need  for  attention  in  anonymous  transaction  in  the
network, deems necessary the supervision of a third-party
with the intention to avoid possible alterations in the result
and audit. Batubara [41] comments that there are challenges
in  the  adoption  of  blockchain  in  e-governments.  She
mentions the creation of new governmental models, as well
as acceptance, since the creation of a platform needs the
cooperation of multiple institution and stakeholders. 
As  seen  in  [12]  it  portrays  the  opportunity  to  use
blockchain  as  an  integration  tool  among  different
governmental database. In article [18] it is mentioned that the
use of blockchain in governmental solutions will help reduce
costs, frauds payment error and the transparency of shared
data between government and citizens. 
2.   Which characteristics are more present in blockchain 
solutions?
In the IoT area,  Karafiloski and Mishev [26] describe the
use of blockchain smart contracts along with smart lockers
connected to the network, to create a renting system without
the need of a third party. The network consensus is the tax
agent.  Khain and Salah [10] argue that the data transmitted
from the devices to blockchain will always be encrypted and
signed by the sender. That guarantees authentication and
integrity of the data sent. 
Another feature is the possibility of audit transmitted data
form  devices  in  the  network  and  smart  contracts,  as  a
decentralized authenticator with simple logic rules and multi-
party. That would have minor complexity to the devices, if
we compare the traditional authorization protocol in which
Role Based Access Management, OAuth 2.0, OpenId, IMA
DM and OMA Lightweight M2M are used. 
According  to  Alketbi  et  al.  [18]  the  change  from  a
centralized  architecture  to a distributed P2P will remove
flaws,  throughput  and  raise  in scalability of  the  system.
Blockchain  will  favor  in  setup  management  of  devices,
storage of sensitive data and to enable micro payment.

Regarding healthcare, Alketbi et al. [18] sees the use of
blockchain as a facilitator for sharing files among users and
doctors, insurance agencies and others, with privacy in focus,
and smart contracts, so that the user is in control of the data.
Shae and Tsai [13] argue about the need of not manipulating
the data in clinical trials in order to avoid health problems in
the patients. In this article, blockchain is described as a
solution to this problem, since the data in the network are
safe,  transparent,  available  in  real  time  and  inviolable.
Consequently, contributing  to  a  greater  precision  in  the
report.
The research articles [26] and [34] describe the need of
choice in which the used data must be sent to the blockchain
network. It is proposed the insertion of user metadata, such
as visitor ID, provider ID and payer ID with a linkage to an
external database. 
In government area, Antipova [32] exposes the need for
government standardization of database in the blockchain, to
maximize  compatibility, interoperability, repeatability  and
quality.
The possibility to audit the data inside the blockchain
network in real time is a very important characteristic that
will help the government to identify fraud swiftly. 
According to [12] using blockchain in government area
will help unify different public service base to allow user
improve their data understanding through authorized smart
contracts.  Olnes  e  Jansen  [9]  analyzed  that   digital  ID
management, safe records  maintenance of digital files are
more adequate cases for government inside the blockchain. 
From T. D. Smith’s survey result [11], it was found the
use of Ethereum as a widely used platform.
3.   Which characteristics are more present in blockchain 
solutions?
In IoT, Karafiloski and A. Mishev describe [26] that the
limitation  in  processing  devices  and  mining  timing
transactions will limit the number of devices to do that in the
network. Billions of devices in the network can lead to a
crash. In their research article, Khan and Salah [10] report
that even if blockchain provides a robust safety to IoT,  there
is still a mechanism problem of consensus, upon mining
hashing power which can be compromised, allowing the
invader  to  be  the  network  owner.  Equally,  private  key
generated in the network are dynamically limited, allowing
the attacker to compromise some account in the network.
In healthcare, the articles [34][11] relate the issue of
keeping all the healthcare database in the network due to its
high operational costs  and the possible security breach in
public blockchain encrypting. Shae and Tsai [13] mention
that data coming from clinical trials sent to blockchain can
entail problems in final reports, since they are shown and
updated in real time. 
In  government,  Hou  [12]  comment  that  the  use  of
blockchain in governmental solutions involve the integration
with various systems, different organizations  and problems
with time and expenses that hinder  solution.  The use of
blockchain as a way of keeping long term unused data, since
it guarantees data reliability. The author defends that data
should be recorded in blockchain as well as in third-party. In
the article [18] summons that blockchain can be attacked  by
Dos(Denial of Service) causing and impact in processing
legitimate pending transactions to miners leading to slowness
in the network.  
Olnes and Jansen [9] created a survey with the main
people in the public sector in 2018, observing emerging
technologies: Robotics, Blockchains, Artificial Intelligence
and Virtual Reality. As a result, the majority answered that
blockchain is immature and not ready to be used in the
public. 
4.   How to analyze the viability of blockchain use in 
projects?
From this present research, it has been observed that
there are challenges and problems in adopting an emergent
technology such as blockchain. Once the viability of using
blockchain  in  projects,  some  characteristics  must  be
observed according to some points below.
Safety:
•
In  projects  which  there  is  the  need  of  keeping
sensitive  data  in  the  network,  some  precautions
should be taken to avoid data  to be read by others
[36]. It is necessary the adoption of a routine of
cryptography  before  the  data  is involved  in the
network.
•
A. Reyna et al. [5] mentions that recorded data in
the  network  are  inalterable,  which  gives  more
security in projects that require reliability. The case
described is in IoT.
•
For solutions which require the need for integration
among many parts involved, A. Reyna et al. [5]
mentions  that  the  network  will  help  keep  data
integrity,  if  there  is  the  necessity  for  every
transaction to be signed by the sender.
     Data Integration:
•
A. Reyna et al. [5] observes that blockchain  will
help  with  the  integration  of  data  provided  by
different devices safely, once all data is signed by
the sender. This will help with more critical projects
which  need  data  integration,  transparently  and
safely.
Auditing:
•
For  projects  in  which  there  is  the  need  for
assessment in real time. Antipova [32] describes
that  blockchain network will help avoid fraud and
increase transparency of data, due to the fact that
every transaction is public and inalterable. 
     Data availability:
•
In projects which require high availability of data,

centralizing entity in controlling data, as well as not
manipulating data. 
     Smart Contract:
•
Khan and Salah [10] defend that blockchain based
in smart contracts can be used to manage, control,
and the most important, to keep IoT devices safe.
This matter, raised by the author, can help projects
to create smart contracts as self-manageable micro
services  with  business  rules  in  the  blockchain
network.
     Data Uniformity:
•
Karafiloski  and  Mishev  [26]  mention  the
opportunity  of  using  blockchain  network  as  a
centralizer of public data from patient, creating a
standardization  of  data  inserted  and  this  project
usually involves stakeholders. It is necessary that
the parts involved create a protocol of data before
sending the transaction to the blockchain network.
     Limitations:
•
For  Smith  [11]  in  IoT,  the  integration  with
blockchain network is challenging due to the fact
that  devices  have  limited  processing,  being
necessary  a  smaller  precision  in  the  consensus
proof-of-state used by network. That can result in a
massive attack on account of the consensus being
reduced. This limitation is taken into consideration
in projects which there is the need for mining of
micro  processed  transactions  or  devices  with
limited processing.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper aimed to identify opportunities, problems and
challenges in the use of the emergent blockchain technology
in many areas. It has been found 906 initial studies, with a
total of 39 primary artefacts left.
To  assure  quality  of  the  evaluated  primary  research
articles, a protocol was developed composed by four stages,
resulting in a great interest for using blockchain in areas such
as healthcare, IoT and government. In each area, there is the
interest of assuring safety of data, integration of data and
scalability of services through blockchain.
Regarding viability of blockchain use in many areas that
do  not  involve  finance,  there  are  still  problems  and
challenges in diverse areas that have been presented. It is
necessary a deeper research per area in order to mitigate risks
in the adoption of and emergent technology in small and big
projects.
This  works  presents  a  important  summarization  of
blockchains  aspects  such  as  problems,  challenges  and
opportunities of technology adoption in projects and it adds
important set of information for the area, as for now, the
amount of works presenting consolidated ideas related to
blockchain are not common and are important in a theme
that can be explored in a variety of ways.
As a future work, guidelines are to be created to provid
projects  and  engineers  with  means  to  better  choose  the
adoption of blockchain technology in several areas.
