Abstract—Network function virtualization (NFV) and
software-deﬁned networking (SDN) represent new
paradigms in networking. In this paper, we extend
the concept of NFV to include the functions associ-
ated to the physical objects of Internet of Things
and name it as network and physical functions
virtualization (N&PV). We propose a novel path
computing framework under QoX constraints based
on such N&PV functions embedding and the paths
algebra. This novel framework is assessed by means
of three use cases and its potential and ﬂexibility are
demonstrated.
Keywords–network functions virtualization; soft-
ware deﬁned network; paths algebra; QoX constraints.
I.
INTRODUCTION
According to [1], software-deﬁned networking
(SDN) emphasizes the role of software in running
networks through the introduction of an abstraction
for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so,
separates it from the control plane. This separation
allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as
experience has already shown.
According to [2], network function virtualiza-
tion (NFV) is a powerful emerging technique with
widespread applicability. Among the NFV high-
level objectives we mention: (i) improved capital
efﬁciencies compared with dedicated hardware im-
plementations; (ii) improved ﬂexibility in assigning
VNFs to hardware.
In this paper, we extend the concept of NFV to
include the functions associated to the physical ob-
jects of Internet of Things and name it as network
and physical function virtualization (N&PFV). The
path computation problem is addressed, under a
wide range of quality constraints: service (QoS),
network economics (QoNE), energy (QoEn), re-
silience (QoR), grade of service (GoS), transport
(QoT), information (QoI).
The main contribution is the proposal of a novel
path computing framework under QoX (where X
represents S, NE, En, etc.) constraints based on
such N&PV functions embedding and the paths
algebra. The framework is assessed by three study
cases and its usefulness and ﬂexibility are demon-
strated.
This paper is organized in the following way:
Section I deﬁnes and introduces the goals and
problems analyzed in this work. In Section II, the
related works are described and the main contri-
butions of this paper are highlighted. In Section
III, an architecture is proposed following the RFC
7426. In Section IV, the procedures used in this
work to identify and to select candidate paths are
explained, and a ﬁtness equation deﬁned to provide
an optimization criterion. In Section V, three use
cases are presented to validate the proposed archi-
tecture and path selection procedures. Section VI
summarizes the results and concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
To reduce costs and improve network manage-
ment, the industry has recently introduced NFV; an
initative that is being standardized by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in
a joint effort that includes the world’s major service
providers and network equipment manufacteres [3]
[4]. The main goal of NFV is to go one step
beyond standard information technology (IT) vir-

tualization in order to consolidate all the cur-
rent network functions onto high volume servers,
switches and storage that can be located anywhere
in the network (commodity hardware). Services are
deployed by chaining a set of Virtual Network
Functions (VNFs) in the commodity hardware. In
this way, functionality can be decoupled from lo-
cation, allowing software to be located at the most
appropriate places. As a consequence, services can
be deployed sharing hardware resources that can
concurrently execute more than one functionality,
reducing network operators’ capital expenditures
(CAPEX) and operating expense (OPEX). A com-
prehensive survey on NFV can be found in [5].
SDN is an emerging paradigm that proposes to
separate network’s control plane from the under-
lying routers and switches (data plane), promot-
ing network control centralization, and introduc-
ing the network programmability. The separation
of concerns introduced between the deﬁnition of
network policies, their implementation in switching
hardware, and the forwarding of trafﬁc, is key to
the desired ﬂexibility: by breaking the network
control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes
it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in
networking, simplifying network management and
facilitating network evolution. A comprehensive
survey on SDN can be found in [6].
The implementation of NFV is being deﬁned
in consonance with the SDN paradigm. In fact,
the management support for the ﬁfth generation
of mobile networks is being conceived as a collab-
orative implementation of SDN and NFV [7] [8].
Currently, the open standardization of SDN is be-
ing performed by the Open Networking Foundation
(ONF) [9]. However, the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) is currently working in the ofﬁcial
standardization of SDN and its control protocol
Open Flow (OF) [1] [10]. Inside the Internet Re-
search Task Force (IRTF), a research group is also
working on SDN since 2013 [11]. With regard to
NFV, the main standardization is being done by
ETSI, speciﬁcally, the NFV cluster is currently
producing the standard documents [3].
This paper proposes a path computing frame-
work under QoX constraints. In this framework, a
path computation element (PCE) is in charge of
computing optimal solutions to either the routing
problem with regard to technical and economic
objectives, or the resource allocation problem in
NFV or network virtualization environments.
With regard to resource allocation in future
internet architectures, there are two widely rec-
ognized problems: The virtual network embedding
(VNE) problem has been tackled in the last years
by the research community [12]. Also, the resource
allocation problem in NFV has been recently tack-
led by several approaches [13]–[17].
The main contribution of this paper, besides the
deﬁnition of an architecture for inter-domain SDN
and NFV, is the proposal of a novel path com-
puting framework under QoX constraints based on
such N&PV functions embedding and the paths
algebra [18]. The framework is assessed by three
study cases and its usefulness and ﬂexibility are
demonstrated.

PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
The purpose of this work is to propose an
architecture to deploy N&PV functions. There are
no restrictions concerning the N&PV functions to
be considered. Any of the functions proposed by
ETSI in [2] are of interest and PCE as described
in [19] as well.
Figure 1 shows a possible SDN implementation
of N&PV functions among different autonomous
systems, that has the following characteristics:
(i) each autonomous system has its own SDN
controller. The controller communicates with the
switching elements using the OF protocol (repre-
sented in grey in the ﬁgure); (ii) the controllers
gather statistics of the underlying substrate network
(represented in black in the ﬁgure), process the
information and publish in the shared database;
(iii) the shared database can be accessed by all
controllers (represented in blue in the ﬁgure). It
can be either a centralized or distributed database
physically hosted in the cloud; (iv) the controllers
form a logical full connected network (represented
in red in the ﬁgure).
In this work, we adopt the SDN architecture
and terminology as proposed in [1]. Accordingly,
this proposal focus on two planes, namely: Control
Plane (CP) - the collection of functions responsible
for controlling one or more network devices; (ii)
Application Plane - the collection of applications
and services that program network behavior.
The controllers shown in Figure 1 are entities of
the CP and the PCE is the main N&PFV function
considered in this work and is an entity of the

between the infrastructure provider (InP) that owns,
controls and publishes the statistics about its in-
frastructure in the shared database, and the service
provider (SP) that access the shared database and
using the PCE running in the application plane
identiﬁes and selects the routes that maximize its
technical and economic objectives.
IV.
PATH IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION
The concepts of paths algebra, developed in
[18] and extended to solve the VNE problem [12]
are used in this work.
The paths algebra uses M as the set of m
adopted routing metrics and F as the set of k
metrics combination functions.
A synthesis S[.] is a set of binary operations
applied on the values of the links combined-
metrics along a path to obtain a resulting value
that characterizes this path as far as the constraint
imposed by the combined-metrics is concerned.
The syntheses are restricted to the following set:
{add(), mult(), max(), min()}.
A path α is worse or less optimized than a
path β, if S[α] ⪯ML S[β], where ⪯ML stands for
multidimensional lexical ordering. For example,
we may have ⪯ML= {≥, ≤}, that is translated
by the following ordering relations: (i) S1[α] ⪯
S1[β] ⇒ S1[α] ≥ S1[β]; (ii) S2[α] ⪯ S2[β] ⇒
S2[α] ≤ S2[β].
Table I presents the parameters, syntheses and
ordering relations to be used to achieve different
QoX objectives.

A. Fitness equation
Let Xi(p) =< xd, xj, xt, xp > be a vector
in which each element represents the end-to-end
delay, jitter, throughput and packet loss rate of ﬂow
fi when using path p respectively. The problem is
to ﬁnd a path p from source node to destination
node for each ﬂow, such that xd ≤ wd and xj ≤
wj and xt ≥ wt and xp ≤ wp for each ﬂow fi.
Consider a path p. Its QoS(p) may be evaluated
by means of a ﬁtness value FIT(p) given by (1) in
which H(n) = 0 if n < 0 or H(n) = 1 if n ≥ 0,
and α, β, γ and δ are the weight factors of the QoS
parameters, that only depend on the application,
and α + β + γ + δ = 1.
The ﬁtness equation has to be deﬁned according
to the application / service and the objective to be
optimized.
The paths algebra framework associated to the
ﬁtness equation provides a powerful and ﬂexible
tool to optimize multidimensional InP and SP
objectives, and it can be fully implemented by the
proposed architecture.

PROOF OF CONCEPT SCENARIOS
EVALUATION
In this section, we describe three scenarios and
show how the proposed architecture and imple-
mentation strategy allows to achieve the envisaged
objectives. All scenarios share a common denom-
inator, namely: employment of N&PFV paradigm,
implemented within a paths algebra framework by
the proposed SDN architecture shown in Figure 1.
A. VNF chaining
The VNF chain composition and embedding
is the main resource allocation challenge in NFV,
commonly called NFV-RA [14]. The objective of a
NFV-RA algorithm is to embed a set of VNF em-
bedding requests (VNFRs) on top of a shared SN
infrastructure in an efﬁcient way. The algorithm has
to consider placement constraints and dependencies
between VNFs. Figure 2 shows a possible solution
of the chain composition problem, depicting a
VNFR and two possible chainings of its VNF
instances.
VNFs can split the trafﬁc ﬂow. In Figure 2a,
this is depicted as links leaving the VNFs: if a VNF
has more than one link, the trafﬁc ﬂow is split into
several subsequent sub-ﬂows. For each link, the rel-
ative trafﬁc (rrel) rate is deﬁned. For instance, for
a deep packet inspection VNF separating incoming
data into two streams (for example, TCP and non-
TCP trafﬁc), it can be speciﬁed that 60% of the
incoming trafﬁc is forwarded to a VNF 2 and 40%
to VNF 3 (cf. VNF 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 2a).
Depending on the ordering of the VNFs, band-
width demands of the network ﬂow changes. The
ordering of VNFs is ﬂexible, but has to consider
dependencies between VNFs. Based on the de-
pendencies, valid chaining options of VNFRs are
derived. Figure 2b depicts two possible chaining
options for the VNFR shown in Figure 2a) where
dtotal is the demand per node depending on the
incoming trafﬁc load. For each VNF, one or more
VNF instances are created: this is due to the fact
that in some scenarios, if the network ﬂow is split,
trafﬁc has still to be processed by the same types of
VNFs, even if trafﬁc is not routed through the same
VNF instances (in Figure 2b, both chains require
two instances of VNF 4).
Once a valid chain is chosen (for instance,
VNF-FG 1), the subsequent challenge is to al-
locate it in the substrate network with regard
to a predeﬁned optimization criterion. Each VNF
speciﬁes whether it needs to be placed on a stor-
age/networking/computing node. Hosting capabil-
ities of substrate nodes and links are limited, the
amount of required processing capacities is spec-
iﬁed for handling the network ﬂow. For example,
a VNF performing video encoding should always
be embedded on top of a computing node and
demands 500MHz of CPU processing capacities
to encode 100MBit/s. The amount of required
capacities depends on the amount of data handled
by that VNF instance (see Figure 3).
This problem is an extension of the VNE prob-
lem. The difference is that the node mapping shall
consider the type availabilities in each substrate
node. To map the VNFs, existing VNE approaches
may be used [22]. The mapping of the virtual links
can be made using the paths algebra framework in
the proposed architecture.

B. Optimization-of-QoEn-and-Qos
In this section, QoEn and QoS aware path
computing will be considered to show how paths
can be provided to allocate a set of NFVs perform-
ing functions over the data plane, regarding QoS
guarantees (bit rate, delay, delay jitter and losses)
while energy consumption is optimized. Figure 4
shows a network topology that is used in this use
case.

Figure 4. Network topology for the QoEn and QoS scenario.
The energy consumption model considered here
is an on-off model. We also assume that services
can be shifted (moved to other servers) and consoli-
dated (some servers can be switched off to save en-
ergy). In this situation, the cost of shifting services
must be considered, since energy is required to
move service from one server to another. A ﬁtness
equation can be deﬁned in this use case including
all these elements. The procedure to search paths
follows 2 basic steps: (i) concerning QoS, search
all paths meeting the demanded QoS; (ii) select the
paths minimizing the energy consumption. At this
stage, shifting and consolidation can be considered,
for those paths where QoS can be still guaranteed.
Metrics considered include the following: energy
consumption, revenue (the resource of the service
allocated), cost (the total amount of resources con-
sumed to get a certain revenue), acceptance ratio
(the ratio of accepted services) and cost / revenue.
Let’s consider simple demands from nodes 1
to 7, 2 to 4 and 6 to 3, all demanding bit rate
30 and maximum end-to-end delay < 20. In these
conditions, the best allocation will be (1, 2, 3, 4,
7) for 1 to 7, (2, 3, 4) for 2 to 4 and (6, 5, 3)
for 6 to 3. In the case 6 to 3, the path (6, 2, 3)
is also possible but delay is larger. So, with no
shifting and consolidation, the remaining resources
after the best allocation is shown in Figure 5.

The metrics are the following: acceptance ratio
= 100%, energy consumption = 7 (7 nodes on), cost
= 30 x 4 links + 30 x 2 links + 30 x 2 links = 240,
revenue = 30 x 3 demands = 90, cost / revenue =
240 / 90 = 2.67.
Let’s activate now shifting and consolidation:
load in node 5 will be moved to node 2, and
node 5 will be switched off. In this situation,
all the metrics remain the same but the energy
consumption is reduced from 7 to 6.
So, the beneﬁts of searching paths by means
of specialized NFVs and deciding using shifting
and consolidation mechanisms in order to manage
QoEn while meeting QoS are proved.

and QoR scenario.
In the ﬁgure, (i) each gray node represents an
autonomous system and is identiﬁed by a number;
(ii) there are 7 autonomous systems in the network.
The autonomous systems 1 and 7 are split in two
just to avoid the use of bi-directional links; (iii)
the autonomous systems 1 and 7 give access to the
data centers DC1 and DC2, respectively; (iv) each
autonomous system has its own SDN controller
and publishes its reachability, performance and
business related information in the shared database.
This is represented by the vectors on top of each
arc meaning the cost/revenue and availability, re-
spectively.
1) Scenario description: A SP wants to access
to provide Big Data processing services to Internet
of Things (IoT) customers identiﬁed as C3, C5 and
C6. Due to the nature of their critical applications
related to healthcare, they want to establish an SLA
in which the QoR and QoNE are assured.
2) QoNE and QoR ﬁtness evaluation: From the
information available in the shared database, the
SP built the adjacency (A), availability (Av) and
cost/revenue (C/R) matrices. The available routes
to the data centers DC1 and DC2 for each customer
found using the paths algebra framework are: (i)
customer in AS3 – (3, 5, 6, 2, 8 = DC1), (DC1 =
1, 2, 3), (3, 5, 4, 9 = DC2), (DC2 = 7, 4, 3); (ii)
customer in AS5 – (5, 6, 2, 8 = DC1), (DC1 = 1,
2, 3, 5), (5, 4, 9 = DC2), (DC2 = 7, 4, 3, 5); (iii)
customer in AS6 – (6, 2, 8 = DC1), (DC1 = 1, 2,
3, 5, 6), (6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 9 = DC2), (DC2 = 7, 4, 3,
5, 6).
Using the synthesis equations given in Table
I for QoNE and QoR the availability and cost
/ revenue ﬁgures for different situations can be
evaluated.
The evaluation of QoNE depends on the
adopted price models. The simulations were run
considering 90 ≤ av ≤ 100 and 2.5 ≤ p ≤ 4.0,
where av and p represent availability and price
respectively. We adopted three prices models in
which the price depends on the network availabil-
ity: a linear model that may be considered as a
reference and the other two represent less (ﬁrst
quadratic) and more (second quadratic) aggressive
price policies. The prices are given in arbitrary
monetary units.
The QoNE is evaluated by the ﬁtness equation
FIT = αg − gl
gl
+ β av − avl
avl
that considers the
normalized gain g and availability av as variables.
The normalized gain g is given by g = p − cr
cr
where cr is the C/R offered by InP. α = β = 0.5
are weighting factors, gl = 0.2 and avl = 97% are
the minimum acceptable values for the normalized
gain and availability, respectively.
The results are given in terms of normalized
ﬁtness deﬁned as ||FIT|| =
FIT
max(|FIT|).

sults for the proposed scenario.

At high levels of network availability the price
models are equivalent, where for medium or low
network availability levels the difference in price
models may represent going from proﬁt to deﬁcit.
From the end user point of view, it is clear that
the network availability is his/her guarantee to pay
a fair price for the service. Otherwise, high prices

will be practiced to protect the gains of the SP.
If the SP offers access to only one data center, it
always achieves a positive ﬁtness and can use the
price models to increase either the attractiveness
of its service by lowering the prices or its gains
by increasing the price. If it offers simultaneous
access to both data centers for a same customer,
there is no policy that may provide positive gains
for the price models adopted in this study.
D. Discussion of results
The study cases presented in the preceding
sections aim at optimizing different objectives,
employ linear and non-linear variables, and deal
with technical and economical constraints. All the
cases are solved using the same mathematical
framework: the paths algebra. It has been proved
that the paths algebra provides an harmonized and
coherent environment to accommodate a complete
and diverse set of objectives and is a powerful way
to implement services policies.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no
equivalent published results that we could compare
to. The results available int the literature are, in
general, restricted to single autonomous systems,
linear variables and the technical and economical
aspects are treated separately.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, a novel path computing frame-
work under QoX constraints based on N&PV
functions embedding was proposed. It relies on
virtual PCEs running in the application plane of an
SDN architecture and on the controllers that can
conﬁgure the switching elements across multiple
autonomous systems. Path identiﬁcation and selec-
tion employs the powerful paths algebra framework
enhanced by a ﬁtness function that is deﬁned
according to the application/service and objectives
of the SP. The framework was assessed by three
study cases and its usefulness and ﬂexibility was
demonstrated.
As future works, we intend to adapt the algo-
rithms of VNE to solve the VNF chaining prob-
lem and evaluate the overall performance sim-
ulating different topologies under different QoX
constraints.
