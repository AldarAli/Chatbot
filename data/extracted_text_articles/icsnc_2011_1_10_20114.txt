Abstract— In this contribution, we study the spectral efficiency 
performance of spread spectrum networks, where the 
networks are generalized to consider the frequency reuse 
factor and arbitrary processing gain resulting from in-cell 
interference, which adds undue penalties in the form of 
network cost. We observed that interference cost generates an 
increase in the received efficiency relative to frequency division 
multiple access (FDMA), weighted against a reduction in the 
signal requirement resulting from using the code division 
multiple access (CDMA) network. In particular, we focus on 
spectral efficiency optimization by studying realistic FDMA 
and CDMA networks operating in Nigeria. Performance 
models for both case studies are also proposed and simulated 
using observed data means as model predictors. We discovered 
that bandwidth effects of channel coding, modulation and 
spread spectrum do have impact on the spectral efficiency and 
the received power by all users under peak load conditions, 
thus necessitating the need for efficient coding and modulation 
and rate adaptation techniques as feasible solutions for 
improving channel capacity and efficiency of the scarce radio 
spectrum.

 INTRODUCTION  
The available radio spectrum for wireless data services 
and systems is extremely scarce, while the demand for these 
services is growing at a rapid pace [1]. Spectral efficiency is 
therefore of primary concern in the design of future wireless 
data communication systems. This efficiency is partly 
achieved by cellular systems that exploit power “fall-off” of 
spatially distributed signals that reuse (or share) the same 
frequency channel across the propagation environment (i.e., 
at various distances or locations). However, while frequency 
reuse provides more efficient use of the limited available 
spectrum, it also introduces unavoidable co-channel 
interference [2-7], which ultimately determines the Bit Error 
rates (BERs) available to each user. Another technique for 
increasing spectral efficiency is the use of multilevel 
quadratic amplitude modulation (M-QAM). This technique 
increases the link spectral efficiency by sending multiple 
bits per symbol [8]. However, wireless channels are 
subjected to severe propagation impairment which results in 
a serious degradation of the link carrier-to-noise ratio 
(CNR). Even if efficient fading compensation techniques 
are used, multilevel schemes will require higher power level 
than binary modulations for a specified BER. Therefore to 
keep the co-channel interference at an acceptable level, it 
becomes necessary to increase the frequency-reuse distance 
(or equivalently the cluster size), which eventually leads to a 
lower system spectral efficiency. 
Previous studies on system spectral efficiency for 
cellular systems assumed constant and equal data rate for all 
users, regardless of interference conditions and channel 
quality [3-9]. Then, spectral efficiency calculation was 
based on a criterion introduced in [10] and defined as the 
ratio of the carried traffic per cell (in Erlangs) to the product 
of the total system bandwidth and area supported by a base 
station. This criterion is not suitable for data systems, as 
Erlangs are just a measure of traffic loading rather than 
throughput intensity. A more pertinent measure of spectral 
efficiency in cellular data systems is the total throughput. 
This problem has been addressed in [9]. They show that 
there exists a tradeoff between the system and the link 
spectral efficiency, which is also confirmed in [11], who 
claim that 4-QAM is the optimum multilevel modulation for 
high-capacity cellular systems, therefore opting for higher 
modulation level will reduce the system’s spectral 
efficiency. This is essentially due to the fact that fixed 
modulation systems designed relative to the CNR produces 
better link and system spectral efficiencies. The basic 
concept of variable-rate transmission is real-time balancing 
of the link budget through adaptive variation of the symbol 
time duration, constellation size, coding rate/scheme, or any 
combination of these [12-13]. Thus, without wasting much 
power or increasing co-channel interference and sacrificing 
BER, this approach provides a much higher average spectral 
efficiency that takes advantage of the “time-varying” nature 
of wireless channel and interference conditions. Under 
favourable interference/channel conditions, the system 
could transmit at high speeds and respond to an increase in 
interference and/or channel degradation through a smooth 
reduction of their data throughput. Since buffering/delay of 
the input data may be required in this process, adaptive 
system techniques are required for applications which are to 
some extent bursty in nature and are therefore best suited for 
high-speed wireless data transmission.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND 
Research works on spectral efficiency has progressed 
steadily over the years. Most of the researches carried out in 
literature concentrate on analytical approaches. Abrardo, 
Benelli, Giambene and Sennati [14] consider a power 
controlled CDMA implemented by varying the transmitted 
power of mobile units such that an adequate signal-to-
interference ratio (SIR) is maintained at the receiver for 
each transmission. They focus on closed-loop power 
control, in which the estimates are formed at the base station 
(BS) receiver, and commands to adjust the transmitted 
power are sent from the BS to the mobile unit. The effect of 
closed-loop power control on system performance is 
considered in [15-17] for receivers that employ rake 
reception. They focus on a CDMA system with specified 
chip rate, but they do not address the difference in multipath 
resolution capability obtained with different chip rates. 
Bonneau, Debbah and Altman [18], Bonneau, Debbah, 
Altman and Caire [19] analyze the performance of uplink 
and downlink CDMA system respectively, with random 
spreading and multi-cell interference. They provide a useful 
framework aimed at determining the base station coverage 
for wireless flat fading channels with very dense networks. 
Considering three receiver structure, they use asymptotic 
arguments to obtain analytical expressions of the spectral 
efficiency with a simple expression that determines the 
network capacity based on few parameters. A general 
analytical 
framework 
quantifying 
the 
area 
spectral 
efficiency (ASE) of cellular systems with variable rate 
transmission is well treated in [20]. They derive expressions 
for the ASE as a function of the reuse distance for the best 
and worse case interference configuration and use Monte 
Carlo simulations to estimate the ASE for average 
interference conditions for partially and fully loaded cellular 
systems. Significant amount of work has been done on 
improving 
the 
spectral 
efficiency 
of 
wireless 
communication systems. The Enhanced Data Rates for 
GSM and TDMA/136 Evolution (EDGE) technology [21] 
provides significantly higher user bit rates and spectral 
efficiency. 
Recently, Isabona, et al. [22] have improved on the 
existing wideband CDMA (WCDMA) user capacity 
expressions in single and multi cell environments for the 
uplink, they integrate new parameters that affect the system. 
They also studied and reported the effect of multi-user 
detection and adaptive antenna gain on users’ capacity in the 
presence of loading, voice activity, sectorization, power 
control and bandwidth efficiency.  
The current work takes a practical look at second 
generation (2G) and third generation (3G) systems. For the 
sake of completeness, a study of the spectral efficiency of 
these systems is made. A performance model is then derived 
for the two network categories using a generic methodology, 
suitable for both systems and verified through computer 
simulations. The research is advantageous because it will 
inform network operators on best practices and how to deal 
with network performance issues as well as enhance 
collaboration between academics and the industries.

MATERIALS AND METHOD 
In this research, we identified two classes of networks: 
the FDMA and CDMA networks, for the purpose of 
collecting empirical data. These networks were the Airtel 
Nigeria and Globacomm Nigeria. For each network case, 
the Erlang-capacity data were obtained over a period of two 
weeks and the spectral efficiency computed. The processing 
gain for each network were acquired from the field and used 
for the computation. The spectral efficiency methodology 
implemented in this paper is summarized in Fig. 1.

SYSTEM MODEL 
The efficient use of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum 
serves as a fundamental design goal for cellular radio 
network engineers. The more calls that can be supported by 
a base station at an acceptable quality, the less base stations 
that are required to support a given subscriber’s demand. 
Since there is large fixed capital costs associated with base 
stations deployment, it becomes desirable to maximize the 
number of subscribers each base station supports. The 
maximum number of users supported by each base station 
per CDMA carrier is given as [16]:

Equation (1) applies to CDMA networks such as IS-95 that 
are non-cooperative, in the sense that they do not exploit 
interference through multi-user detection. This equation has 
historically been associated with CDMA networks when 
interference rises to a level where users cannot compensate 
for less than the desired quality of service (QoS), by 
increasing their transmit power. Such a condition establishes 
a maximum on the number of users supported for a given 
QoS objective and in theory, a pole exists in the transmit 
power required to meet the expected QoS. Equation (1) 
holds when all users at the various base stations possess the 
required

 needed to meet a QoS objective 
such as the mean opinion score (MOS) or a frame error rate 
(FER). This is a pole condition, since any additional user 
would create interference that could not be compensated for 
through further increase in the transmitted power. Various 
forms of (1) can be derived [16][23][24] by assuming that 
the number of interfering users in the serving cell that 
creates the in-cell interference (ICI) power is the same as 
the number of users in the other base stations that creates the 
out-of-cell interference (OCI) power. This assumption 
counts the desired signal as interference, which becomes 
significant for lower processing gains. Disregarding this 
assumption, the number of users for arbitrary processing 
gains and frequency reuse can be established. The following 
generalization considers the impact of allowing and 
prohibiting in-cell-interference in cellular systems design. 
A. Speading with In-cell Interference: A CDMA Case 
Let us consider an idealized hexagonal lattice of base 
stations where the number of users supported by each base 
station is increased uniformly throughout the network, until 
the interference-and-noise power is just at a level required to 
meet a given QoS objective. At this point, the network 
ideally blocks additional calls due to QoS considerations. 
Blocking due to resource limitation (a traditional blocking 
mechanism that applies to any cellular technology) is 
assumed here to be insignificant. A bit stream after source 
coding of Rb bits per second, expands in bandwidth due to 
modulation, with a spectral efficiency of modulation η . A 
spreading sequence of bandwidth W
, increases the 
bandwidth before spreading B , by a spreading gain of: 
B
G = W
 
 
 
 
(2) 
The positive bandwidth of a RF signal is doubled due to 
spectrum shift. Tradeoffs arising from using different 
combinations of spreading, modulation, and coding for a 
fixed bandwidth and spectrum efficiency constitute a decade 
of research [25-27]. Exploring these tradeoffs necessitate 
the consideration of not only the required SNR per bit

The number of users per carrier can be obtained directly by

term. So, before channel coding and modulation,

ANALYSIS OF REALISTIC CDMA AND FDMA 
SYSTEMS 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
current 
telecommunication 
technologies will give high system performance, i.e., the 
performance capabilities of CDMA systems should be 
higher than that of FDMA systems, because they posses the 
ability 
to 
offer 
high 
speed 
data 
transfers 
and 
video/multimedia communications. This also implies that 
the higher the spectral efficiency, the better the system. As 
can be seen in Fig. 2, the CDMA system under study has a 
higher spectral efficiency than the FDMA system, but the 
spectral efficiency in the CDMA system has an inconsistent 
trend compared to that of FDMA system, which inconsistent 
pattern can easily be predicted. We observed that the main 
reason behind the unstable nature of the system lies in the 
initial design concept, where more flexibility is emphasized 
4

thus allowing the scheduling scheme to depend largely on 
the operator’s choice. 
The observed effect is largely due to the high 
interference/traffic and inefficient frequency reuse technique 
(in CDMA) noticed during the study period. To provide a 
coherent pattern for model prediction, we fit trend line 
equations to the average spectral efficiency plots in Fig. 3. 
The computed coefficient of determination (R2) for both 
networks show that in the CDMA system under study, 
spectral efficiency is not significantly influenced by the 
number 
of 
base 
stations, 
but 
on 
some 
other 
factors/parameters that could be optimized at the base 
stations to service the increased systems capacity. 
Specifically, optimization should include techniques that 
mitigate multi-path fading/shadowing, a major contributor 
to co-channel interference. The number of base stations 
tends to have diminutive influence on the spectral efficiency 
in the FDMA system. This is due to the fixed radio 
spectrum at each base station. The fitted trend line is also 
useful for the prediction of new empirical results.

Further findings reveal that mobile operators/field 
engineers have little or no knowledge on performance 
measures and problem solving techniques. This is largely 
due to the fact that in Nigeria, most of these operators are 
updating their services from 2G to 3G technologies and as a 
result tend to carry the idea of frequency bound technology, 
which does not suffer much interference into a frequency-
reuse technology, which is interference-prone. However, 
detail interactions show that more interest seems to be placed 
on profit making and ad-hoc maintenance/services, rather 
than problem solving and service improvements. 
 
VI. 
SIMULATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
Sample data from the field were used to judge the 
performance of the existing system. Simulation runs were 
carried out to evaluate the performance of both systems 
using the proposed system models. The input parameters 
and their respective values used during the simulation are 
shown in Table 1. These parameters on the average gave 
optimum performance and enabled us to report on the 
systems performance. Sample outputs were generated in the 
form of graphs using MATrixLABoratory plot commands. 
The graphs which predict the systems’ behaviour and 
important results obtained from the simulation are 
discussed.

modeled to improve the system performance. This technique 
overcomes the adverse effects of frequency selective fading 
channels and offers high spectral efficiency. Although the 
influence of higher order modulation on the spectral 
efficiency of multi inter-cell systems is similar (in 
performance) to single cell systems [29], interference

remains a notorious obstacle to attain wide area coverage 
and high spectral efficiency in cellular systems. In general, 
interference from adjacent cells significantly reduces the 
spectral efficiency for discrete modulation efficiency, 
calling for an increase in the constellation size to obtain a 
high spectral efficiency for low noise region. As earlier 
observed, CDMA systems are interference-limited rather 
than noise-limited. This defect however results in negative 
consequences such as: (i) inter-channel interference (ICI) 
and inter-symbol interference (ISI), (ii) BER exceeding the 
target 
Eb N0
, requiring increased signal strength and SINR, 
reduced traffic-load and/or reduced bit-rate to maintain the 
network QoS, (iii) increased transmit power due to 
neighboring users requesting more power to contend with 
the increased interference. As a result, it is important to 
maximise the network capacity by ensuring that each user 
transmits with a required minimum power such that the 
interference caused by other users within the network is 
minimised. With this the base station will have the capacity 
to accommodate more users. This results in a second-order 
effect where each base station lowers the transmit power for 
interference cancellation-enabled users, with the aim of 
mitigating noise on all mutually interfering sectors and leads 
to further reduction in the network transmit power.  
In the uplink, the spectral efficiency of the systems 
under study decreased with the number of users. This is 
primarily due to the following reasons: (i) more power is 
occupied to transmit the uplink pilot signal, (ii) more 
resource is used to maintain the minimal transmit rate for 
each user, as a result, each user suffer severe interference. 
Also, we have observed during simulation that the rise 
above thermal (r) and its outage rate are two important 
performance measures that indicate the degree of stability of 
the system. These matrices could as well be optimised to 
ensure users satisfaction in practical systems.  
Figs. 5 and 7 show the plots of spectral efficiency (SE) 
versus SNR with coding and modulation as performance 
improvement parameters for FDMA and CDMA systems 
respectively. These graphs show that as the user density 
increases, the radio resources to support them gets 
exhausted. In general, systems with higher SE provides 
more data services and support more users at a given grade 
of service (GoS) before experiencing resource exhaustion. 
The impact of this on the network performance is that, as 
the traffic load increases, the total base station transmit 
power also increases, because users require more transmit 
power from the base station to maintain stability in dense 
interference. This effect causes a major decrease in the 
coverage probability and thus degrades the network 
performance, resulting in users experiencing a greater 
number of dropped and blocked calls.

In addition, high-power transmitters will generally offer 
reduced capacity and network efficiency to adjacent channel 
users. This problem of power limitation usually occurs in 
urban areas, where the spectrum is likely to be more 
congested, but is much less of a problem in rural areas, that 
sparsely use the spectrum. To address this problem, 
transmitted power levels in urban environments should be 
lowered and increased in rural environments. Power can be 
reduced through the deployment of low-power transmission 
networks, such as those currently used in cities by cellular 
and PCS service providers. With more transmitters, the 
transmission capacity will increase. Power in rural areas can 
be increased by permitting even higher power levels. This 
could enable service to be provided in areas that can’t be 
economically justified at the moment. 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Cellular technology is a fascinating and fast growing area 
of research in the communication world, where more 
researches will be of enormous benefits, considering the 
increasing attention it has attracted globally. We have 
studied the spectral efficiency optimization in spreading 
spectrum of two different networks, the CDMA and FDMA 
network respectively. We adopted a practical approach and 
have provided best practices for network providers. Results 
obtained show that bandwidth effects of channel coding, 
modulation and spread spectrum can significantly impact on 
the spectral efficiency and the received interference of 
CDMA systems. However, the spectral efficiency of the 
system drops depending on the interference level. This fact 
and the much demanding implementation of higher order 
modulation 
schemes 
and 
interference 
cancellation 
techniques [30] should be considered during system design. 
We have discovered that in Nigeria for instance, issues of 
spectral efficiency management and enactment of the right 
policy to accommodate the growing spectrum demands in 
both private and public sectors is yet to be effectively 
addressed. This is due to the unplanned/inefficient 
deployments of some communication services, congested 
cities and poor topologies. However, the following are 
helpful hints a commission/regulatory body can adopt to 
improve spectral efficiency: (i) access improvement through 
power, time, frequency, bandwidth, and space; (ii) flexible 
use of the spectrum (i.e., unhindered users/uses permission); 
(iii) encouraging efficient spectrum use; (iv) combination of 
technically-compatible systems; (v) adjusting regulations 
inline with technological improvements. 
To create an enabling environment for future research 
work and improvements, a holistic survey of the current 
spectral efficiency performance is important, as this will 
reveal the level of inefficiency in the existing system and 
create room for a more structured approach and effective 
state-of-the-art implementation plan. This we intend to 
pursue on the acquisition of research funding.  
This contribution has enormous potentials as follows: 
• 
It will impact on the telecommunications industry 
and inform network operators on how to improve 
on the performance of their system 
• 
It presents a practical approach to spectral 
efficiency analysis 
• 
It will bootstrap further research and development 
in this area 
• 
It will establish/strengthen collaboration between 
the academia and telecom industries 
• 
It will advise network operators who are always 
afraid to release data to see the need for research 
partnership in order to improve their services
