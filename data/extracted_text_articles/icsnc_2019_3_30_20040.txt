Abstract— Increasing number of aging structures and damage 
caused by natural disasters are major issues in railways. It is 
difficult to instantly detect the deterioration and damage of 
structures in normal inspection cycles, hence, studies of the 
condition monitoring system for railway facilities have been 
developed to grasp these conditions frequently. Most of 
condition monitoring systems for railway structures in recent 
years consist of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). To design a 
WSN, it is necessary to grasp the characteristics of the 
frequency for the railway environment. In our research, the 
920 MHz band of radio wave frequency, which was released as 
Industry Science and Medical (ISM) band since 2012 in Japan, 
was focused. Also, as an example of condition monitoring for 
railway structures, the WSN for railway embankment was 
selected. We considered the case where the sensor was buried 
underground and the case of rain as factors affecting wireless 
transmission and confirmed that the signal strength of 920 
MHz radio waves were attenuated in these cases.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Railways in Japan are excellent transport infrastructure 
with mass, high speed, safety features, therefore, it plays an 
important role in passenger and freight transport [1]. 
However, the number of aging structures is increasing since 
many of the railway structures were built before the 1970s. 
Furthermore, railway structures have been severely damaged 
due to many natural disasters in recent years [2]. Hence, it is 
required to properly maintain railway structures. On the 
other hand, in Japan, the aging of workers and the decline of 
the working population have become serious issues. Under 
these circumstances, it is an urgent issue to efficiently 
maintain the increasing aging structures and to take disaster 
prevention. 
At present, maintenance of railway structures is carried 
out by inspection and soundness evaluation every 2 years, 
and repair or replacement is performed as necessary [1]. 
However, a lot of manpower is required in normal inspection 
since a visual inspection is performed. Hence, it is desirable 
to develop a method that can efficiently maintain and 
manage many structures. Additionally, there is a growing 
need for technology that can quickly grasp the situation in 
the field when a natural disaster occurs. One of the methods 
for realizing these requirements is condition monitoring 
using a WSN. Figure 1 shows an example of WSN [3]. There 
are various choices for the frequency band of radio waves 
used for WSN. Among them, the 920 MHz band which is 
newly released in Japan as an ISM band since 2012, is 
especially attracting attention. Therefore, research and 
development of WSN using the 920MHz band has been

actively conducted in recent years [3]-[8]. 
The 920 MHz band can be used without a license when 
the transmission power is 20mW or less, which corresponds 
to the 860 MHz band in Europe. Compared with the 429 
MHz band which has been used conventionally for a WSN, 
the 920 MHz band has a high transmission rate and can 
perform large-scale multi-hop transmission. Similarly, 
compared with the 2.45 GHz band, it has a longer 
transmission distance and radio waves are easily diffracted. 
Therefore, it is expected to be one of the effective frequency 
bands for use in a railway environment which is spread 
linearly and has a large number of various facilities [4]. 
However, in order to receive the desired data stably with 
WSN in the railway, it is necessary to design an appropriate 
WSN in consideration of the various railway-specific 
environment [5][6]. In general WSN design, the transmitter 
is installed at a high position to improve the radio wave 
propagation environment [7][8]. On the other hand, in 
railways, the safe operation of trains is the top priority, so 
transmitters can’t be installed in free places. For example, 
when constructing a WSN for facilities on the railway slope 
or near track, if the transmitter is installed at a high position, 
it may fall and interfere with train operation when a disaster 
occurs. Therefore, we must design the WSN assuming the 
transmitter is installed in a low position or buried in the 
ground. 
Japanese railway structures have a high rate of 
embankment and cutting, and natural disasters can severely 
damage railway slopes. Therefore, in this study, we selected 
embankment monitoring as an example of a WSN for 
railway structures.  
To build a WSN that monitors the condition of 
embankment, 
we 
first 
conducted 
a 
transmission 
characteristic test of the 920 MHz band with the transmitter 
buried in the ground. Next, based on the test results, we 
constructed a WSN in the railway test embankment and 
conducted a performance measuring test for about 1 month.  
The rest of the present paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 introduces related works about a WSN for slope 
monitoring and a transmission characteristic test for the 
920MHz band. Section 3 describes the transmission 
characteristic test where the transmitter is buried in the 
ground. Section 4 describes the performance measuring test 
of WSN, and Section 5 describes the conclusion and future 
work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
When constructing a WSN on the embankment, it is 
conceivable to early detection the slope failure by 
measuring the soil moisture content and the inclination 
angle in the embankment. As a similar existing research, 
there is research on sensor networks aimed at detecting 
slope failure [9][10]. Existing research considers data loss 
rate and sensor measurement values, but does not consider 
attenuation characteristics by the Received Signal Strength 
Indicator (RSSI). Also, as existing research that measured 
the RSSI, there is research that considers the effects of 
vegetation [11]. Existing research is evaluating the effects of 
vegetation growth on radio wave propagation based on 
RSSI measurement values. By measuring RSSI, it is 
possible 
to 
quantitatively 
grasp 
the 
attenuation 
characteristics of radio waves. In the WSN on the railway 
embankment that we are aiming for, not only the effects of 
vegetation but also the possibility of transmitting data with a 
transmitter buried in the ground. In addition, it may be 
affected by rainfall due to the outdoor environment. 
Therefore, in order to receive the desired data stably, it is 
very important to quantitatively grasp the attenuation 
characteristics due to the buried condition and rainfall, and 
improve the accuracy of WSN design.

TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTIC TEST IN BURIED 
CONDITION 
We conducted a test to confirm to the transmission 
characteristic of the 920MHz band radio wave in buried 
condition. This section describes the test methods and 
results and discussion. 
A. Test Method [5] 
In this test, we used the transmitter of Wireless Smart 
Utility Network (Wi-SUN), which is one of the 920 MHz 
band radio communication standards (Table I) [12]. Wi-SUN 
uses IEEE 802.15.4g, which is an extension of IEEE 
802.15.4 used in the Zigbee physical layer, and because it

can transmit IPv6 packets, it is suitable for storing data in the 
cloud via a network such as Wi-Fi [4]. 
Figure 2 and Table II show the test configuration and test 
conditions. As shown in Figure 2, the transmitter was buried 
0.1m below the ground and the receiver was installed 1.0m 
above the ground surface. First, we measured the RSSI 
where the transmitter was a normal condition (not buried 
condition). Then, we buried the transmitter in the ground and 
measured RSSI again. Also, dry soil was used when burying 
the transmitter to exclude the influence of moisture originally 
contained in the added soil. Evaluation of the test results was 
performed by comparing the RSSI in the normal condition 
and the buried condition. Also, when the transmission 
distance was 0.7m, we measured RSSI by changing the soil 
depth (0.05m, 0.1m, 0.15m). WSN is required to be able to 
easily perform maintenance such as battery replacement. For 
that reason, it is not realistic to buried a transmitter deep 
underground. Therefore, the soil depth was set on the 
assumption that maintenance is easy. 
B. Results and Discussion [5] 
Figure 3(a)(b) shows the test result. In Figure 3(a), the 
red dots are the RSSI in the normal condition, and the blue 
triangles are the RSSI in the buried condition, and the green 
squares are the Loss (difference between normal condition 
and buried condition). Each RSSI value is an average value 
of 100 transmission data. As shows Figure 3, when the 
transmitter is buried, it can be confirmed that radio waves are 
attenuated by about 20 dB regardless of the transmission 
distance. From the above results, we propose to consider a 
margin of at least about 20 dB when designing WSN with 
the transmitter buried 0.1m below the ground. 
 As shown in Figure 3(b), in this test, there was no 
difference in Loss when the soil depth was 0.05m and 0.1m, 
but when the soil depth was 0.15m, the Loss was increased 
by about 3dB. The loss is based on the buried condition of 
0.7m transmission distance and 0.1m soil depth. 
IV. 
PERFORMANCE MEASURING TEST OF WSN IN 
BURIED CONDITION 
We conducted a test to confirm to the performance of 
the 920MHz band WSN in buried condition. This section 
describes the test methods and results and discussion. 
A. Test Method 
We constructed a WSN in the test embankment based on 
the above test results. In railway slope condition monitoring, 
the sensors must be installed at various positions depending 
on the shape of the slope. For this reason, in this test, the 
sensor placement was determined assuming the condition 
monitoring for the railway slope. Figure 4 shows the 
transmitter architecture and the construction status of WSN. 
As shown in Figure 4, a chip antenna was used as the 
transmitter antenna, and the transmitter is powered utilizing a 
rechargeable battery. Also, regarding the construction status 
of WSN, a total of seven transmitters were installed, where 
four transmitters were buried 0.1m below the ground, and 
three transmitters were installed 1.2m above the ground. On 
the other hand, the receiver was installed on the second floor 
of the laboratory (4.5m above the ground).

Table III shows measurement items and transmission 
intervals. In this test, the transmitters were improved so that 
transmission path data could be acquired along. If the buried 
transmitter can’t transmit directly to the receiver, the WSN is 
designed to switch transmission paths and transmit data to 
the receiver using multi-hop transmission through the ground 
mounted transmitter. Then, the test for about 1 month was 
conducted at a data transmission interval of 10-minutes. Also, 
the weather data was measured by wired communication 
with a weather observation equipment. 
In addition, in this test, the measurement interval is 10-
minutes, but we consider that a measurement interval of 1 
hour to 1 day is sufficient for continuous condition 
monitoring in a production environment [13]. When the 
interval of measurement and transmission is 1 hour, the 
battery lifetime is assumed to be about half a year. 
B. Results and Discussion 
This section shows the results of change over time of 
transmitter RSSI and 10-minutes rainfall. Also, among 
transmitters that are large attenuated the RSSI due to rainfall, 
the result of buried transmitter C are shown in Figure 5(a) 
and the ground mounted transmitter E are shown in Figure 
5(b). Although the RSSI attenuation was some difference, 
similar results were obtained with other transmitters. 
Additionally, the color of each dot in a figure represents the 
communication destination, and the green dot shows 
communicated with the transmitter E and the red dot shows 
communicated with the receiver. Thereby, the transmission 
path of each transmitter can be grasped. 
Firstly, we describe the attenuation characteristics of 
radio waves in rainfall. As shown in Figure 5(a), the buried 
transmitter confirmed that the RSSI was attenuated in 
conjunction with the rainfall. Furthermore, it was confirmed 
that it takes a certain time to recover to the normal value 
after the attenuation. The existing research [6] showed that 
the 920 MHz band radio waves became more attenuated 
according to the increase of moisture content of the snow on 
the transmission path. Therefore, it can be considered that 
the increase in soil moisture due to rainfall attenuates the 
RSSI, and influences radio wave propagation until drainage 
is completed. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 5(b), the 
ground mounted transmitter shows little fluctuation in RSSI 
during this test. It seems that the influence of rainfall directly 
on RSSI attenuation is small. 
Also, regarding buried transmitter C, the relationship 
between rainfall and loss is shown in Figure 6 for the period 
in which continuous rainfall is observed. The target period is

the portion highlighted in red in Figure 5(a). Here, rainfall is 
a cumulative value from the observation of rainfall to the 
point where RSSI has most attenuated, and the loss is a 
difference between the average value of RSSI before rainfall 
observation (2 hours) and the RSSI during the rainfall 
observation. As shown in Figure 6, the loss increases in 
proportion to the cumulative rainfall, and in this test, a loss 
of up to 17 dB is confirmed at about 9 mm of cumulative 
rainfall. 
Next, we describe the transmission path. As shown in 
Figure 5(a), the communication destination is switched from 
the receiver to the transmitter E at the beginning of the test. 
Figure 7 shows the result of extracting 6 hours before and 
after path switching. As shown in Figure 7, the transmission 
path is switched at the timing of rainfall. Furthermore, when 
data was directly transmitted to the receiver, the RSSI was -
90dBm or less, but after path switching, the RSSI improved 
by about 10dB. Therefore, we estimate that the path has been 
switched to the transmitter with a better propagation 
environment, triggered by the deterioration of the radio wave 
propagation environment due to rainfall. Additionally, as the 
results, it has been confirmed that multi-hop transmission is 
possible in the buried condition. Table IV shows the data 
arrival rate to the receiver from each transmitter. As shown 
in Table IV, in the buried transmitters, data loss occurred in 3 
out of 4 transmitters. As mentioned above, we estimate that 
one of the main factors is that the radio wave propagation 
environment is deteriorated due to rainfall and the RSSI is 
attenuated. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, we carried out a transmission characteristic 
test of 920 MHz band in a buried condition and a 
performance measuring test of WSN on the test embankment.  
As the results, in the transmission characteristic test, it is 
confirmed that there is an attenuation of about 20 dB 
regardless of the transmission distance when the transmitter 
is buried in the soil about 0.1m. Furthermore, in the 
performance measuring test, it is confirmed that multi-hop 
transmission with switched transmission path is possible

even when direct transmission of data to the receiver 
becomes difficult. On the other hand, when the soil on the 
propagation path contains moisture due to continuous rainfall, 
it has been confirmed that the attenuation is so large, and 
data loss occurs. Consequently, we regard that WSN design 
in a buried environment needs to consider the attenuation 
due to burial and rainfall. 
In the future, we are going to continue testing to further 
improve the WSN design in the railway environment. 
Furthermore, we are also going to confirm the long term 
performance of WSN and the relationship between soil 
moisture content and loss. In addition, since the place where 
the test was conducted this time is a snowfall area, we will 
also examine the effects of snow depth and melted snow on 
radio wave propagation in the 920 MHz band. In addition to 
the embankment where this test was conducted, the railway 
has many facilities with severe transmitter installation 
conditions. This result is expected to be used as basic 
knowledge for constructing a large-scale 920 MHz band 
WSN in the railway environment in the future.
