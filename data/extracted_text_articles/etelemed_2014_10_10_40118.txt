Abstract-The number of people reaching old age is increasing
rapidly, challenging the society and healthcare to promote
healthy and meaningful aging. There is, and has been for a
few years, a big interest in collecting patient reported
outcomes (PROs)
as a base
for clinical
management.
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and
assistive technology in elderly care increase and may
facilitate the care of older adults as they are moved from
nursing homes to private homes. An ICT-platform for
reporting health issues with immediate access to self-care
advice
and
direct
communication
with
healthcare
professionals has been developed. The overall aim of this
project is to evaluate the effects of the interactive ICT-
platform regarding optimal functionality and participatory
care. The project will be conducted in three phases:
development of the ICT-platform, feasibility evaluation and
evaluation of effects. The platform is unique by integrating
interactive components for direct clinical management and
needs to be thoroughly evaluated before implementation in
daily practice. It is hypothesized that, by using an interactive
ICT-platform,
it
will
promote
participatory
care
and
enhance the communication between older adults and their
professional carers. The platform will be further developed,
as well as tested in a full-scale study.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In the Western world, the number of people reaching
older age is increasing quite rapidly. Better living
conditions such as improvements in nutrition, health and
healthcare give a higher life expectancy and can be an
explanation for the increase [1, 2]. The aging and elderly
populations
are
placing
demands
on
society,
and
especially
on
healthcare,
to
promote
healthy
and
meaningful
aging,
according
to
the
World
Health
Organization’s (WHO) concept of “active ageing” [3].
This project will establish a new and modern technique
where older adults can accurately report factors that
influence
their
health
and
daily
life,
as
well
as
systematically
and
rapidly
communicate
these
to
healthcare professionals caring for them. The older adults
will
also
have
access
to
instant
self-care
advice
appropriate to the level of factors they report. This will
enable problems to be identified earlier and necessary
interventions to be initiated more promptly and enhance
the communication between older adults and healthcare
professionals,
an
approach
to
healthcare
that
is
encouraged and needed today. We also intend to develop
our theoretical model, The Participatory Care Model,
which will support the implementation of a personalized
interactive monitoring system for the older adults. The
model focuses on allowing patients to take a participatory
role in their own health and health care in an interaction
with the healthcare providers i.e. being a member of the
team.

BACKGROUND
A.
Patient-reported outcomes measure
A
Patient
Reported
Outcome
Measure
(PROM)
includes all the aspects of a patient’s health status,
including disease symptoms, functioning and Health-
Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), so that they are able to
directly
communicate
these
aspects
to
healthcare
professionals without interpreting the patient’s response
by a caregiver or anyone else [4]. There is, and has been
for a few years, a big interest in collecting PROM as a
base for clinical management. Different ways have been
used, for a long time pen and paper, but recently
applications,
such
as
touch
screens
and
web-based
systems, have been tested to collect PROMs [5]. Several
studies in this area have shown that the use of PROM in
clinical settings can simplify the detection of problems,
facilitate communication between patients and clinicians,
promote shared decision making and enhance patient
satisfaction [6, 7].
B.
Information and communication technology
Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
friendly utilities and assistive technology in elderly care
tend to increase since the care of older adults is not
performed in nursing homes but in private homes instead
[8]. The WHO defines E-health as “the transfer of health
resources and health care by electronic means” [9] which
makes the concept closely connected to activities on the
Internet.
A
complement
to
E-health
is
assistive
technology, which is defined by the WHO as a concept for
any device or system that enables an individual to carry
out an activity that otherwise would be very difficult or
impossible to carry out [10]. ICT can help older adults to
stay independent and healthy [11]. Overall, ICT combined
with a strong governance structure and a fair performance
management may result in integrated healthcare [12] and
promotion
of
self-management
[13].
Using
ICT
to
enhance the care of and for older adults has several
advantages such as providing information on how to
manage occurring health issues [14]. The use of ICT has
been shown to improve Quality of Life and feelings of

being safe among older adults suffering from Alzheimer’s
Disease [15].
We did a scoping review to explore the concept
optimal functionality in old age (people over 65 years of
age in developed countries) and to integrate it with
PROM. A total of 25 scientific articles were analysed.
Three major themes were identified in the concept of
optimal functionality in old age: self-related factors, body-
related factors and external factors [16].
As far as we know, no studies regarding older adults
using interactive ICT to promote optimal functionality
have been made, thus showing that a knowledge gap can
be seen in this area. The overall aim of this study is to
evaluate the effects of an ICT- platform integrated with
PROM to assess its effects on older adults’ optimal
functionality and participatory care.
The specific research questions are:
-
How will the mobile phone system enable older
adults
to
enhance
engagement
in
self-care
activity in order to improve health and optimal
functionality?
-
How feasible, user-friendly, and accepted is the
ICT-platform from the elderly and health care
professional´s perspective?
-
How does the use of an interactive ICT-platform
contribute to participatory care?
III.
METHOD
The project will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1
includes development of the ICT-platform; Phase 2
evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of the ICT-
platform; and Phase 3 concerns evaluation of effects.
A.
Phase 1 The development of the ICT-platform
In a literature review and interviews with older adults
and nurses involved in homecare, determination of the
content of the questions in the application was explored
(Fig 1).
1) Review of the literature, interviews with experts,
older adults (n=12, >65 years of age) and healthcare
professionals (n=8) were conducted to identify indicators
that promote and/or counteract a good daily life and
health. Fifteen areas were identified: fever, dizziness,
difficulties eating, diarrhea, constipation, pain, fatigue,
difficulties
sleeping,
worry,
depression
(sadness,
dysphoria), difficulties performing daily activities indoors,
difficulties performing activities outdoors, difficulties
performing activities with others, experience of being
safe, and experience of having a meaningful daily life of
which 15 questions were created.
The structure of questions included in the application
is
based
on
standardized
symptom
and
QoL
questionnaires [17, 18] that is, the questions ask for
occurrence, frequency, and distress level. For example
“Do you experience constipation?” If the answer is yes,
the older adult is asked how often it occurs, rated by
frequency: never, sometimes, rather often, or very often.
Furthermore, the older adult is asked how distressing the
symptom is: not at all, a little, rather, or very much. The
older adults will report at least three days during a week.
A reminder message is sent if report has not been
submitted.
Besides
the
questions,
the
application
contained evidence-based self-care advice related to the
older adults´ concerns. Additionally, the application
contains links to suggested relevant websites for more
reading. The application also included a history graph in
which the older adults could see how they reported their
health status over a period of time (Fig. 1). A risk
assessment model based on occurrence and frequency of
the reported data was integrated into the application.
Depending on the severity of the reported data, the nurse
in charge could receive two sets of alarms to their work
mobile phone (text messages), red and yellow alarms. Red
was the more acute one meaning that the nurse would
contact the older adult within a few hours; the yellow
alarm meant that the nurse would contact the older adult
the next day at the latest. This initiates an interaction
whereby a nurse contacts the older adults for discuss their
concerns.
With the help of a Swedish health management
company
(Health
Navigator),
the
contents
were
implemented in a smart tablet as an application. The
nurses in charge could also log into a web-interface and
view the reports of the older adults on their computers
(Fig. 2).

B.
Phase 2 The evaluation of the feasibility and
acceptability of the ICT-platform
1) Eight older adults, ranging between the ages of 67
to 90 years of age, were included in the study. Inclusion
criterions for participating in the study were being over 65
years of age, having a healthcare contact, being able to
speak Swedish and also being able to read and write in
Swedish. The older adults should be cognitively intact
and/or not have an altered mental status. All the study
participants were given a tablet (Nexus Google). The
older adults tested the tablet with the ICT-application for a
period of four weeks. Three nurses working with the older
adults agreed to participate in the study. They were
informed about the study, how the interactive system
worked and how they would proceed when logging into
the web-interface as well as view how the older adults
have reported. The nurses were also informed on how
they would handle the alarms coming into their work
mobile phones.
2) Both older adults and nurses were asked to
participate in individual interviews after the four weeks
had
passed.
The
older
adults
were
interviewed
individually and asked about the usability of the tablet and
the application and the relevance of the questions in the
health measure. The nurses were also interviewed about
the relevance of the questions and about their experience
of monitoring reports from the older adults and using the
web-interface. Overall, the older adults found using the
tablet and application as quite favourable. The application
was perceived as user friendly, educational and fun to use.
The questions were seen as relevant and clear but also as
having a more broad perspective. The nurses in the study
experienced the system as valuable and as something that
could make the care with the older adults more accessible.
One
nurse
expressed
that
this
was
a
way
of
communicating with the older adults directly without any
intermediaries.
C.
Phase 3 The evaluation of effects
Next phase of this project will focus on testing the
ICT-platform in a larger group of older adults (n=50) for a
period of six months. There will also be a control group
not using the ICT-platform to evaluate and determine its
effects. Main outcomes are areas related to optimal
functionality (for examples well-being, mental health, gut
health, nutritional status, health literacy, coping ability,
self-care and risk for falling). Interviews with the older
adults and the health care professionals will also be
conducted focusing on participatory care.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The first phases of this study show that the interactive
developed ICT-platform was feasible from both the older
adults and their nurses’ perspective. These studies will
deepen our understanding of how older adults perceive
participatory care, i.e., being a member of a team, when it
came to the older adults’ own healthcare plans, using
PROM. Conclusively, the concept of optimal functionality
can in the future enhance participatory care in the sense
that the older adults know and are aware of their
preferences. Possible effects will be measured in a larger
sample of older adults and will enable us to improve and
develop
the
ICT-platform,
as
well
as
develop
opportunities
to
increase
older
adults´
optimal
functionality.
