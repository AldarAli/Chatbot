Abstract— Communications within personal working/living 
spaces are highly demanded. To support people’s wayfinding 
activities, we propose a Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
cooperative system that supports guidance services and uses an 
edge/fog-based architecture for wayfinding services. A mesh 
cellular hybrid structure is proposed. The dynamic navigation 
system is composed of several transmitters (ceiling luminaries), 
which send the map information and path messages required 
to wayfinding. The luminaires are equipped with one of two 
types of nodes: a “mesh” controller that connects with other 
nodes in its vicinity and can forward messages to other devices 
in the mesh, effectively acting like routers nodes in the network 
and a “mesh/cellular” hybrid controller, that is also equipped 
with a modem providing IP base connectivity to the central 
manager services. These nodes act as border-router and can be 
used for edge computing. Mobile optical receivers, using joint 
transmission, collect the data at high frame rates, extracts their 
location to perform positioning and, concomitantly, the 
transmitted data from each transmitter. Each luminaire, 
through VLC, reports its geographic position and specific 
information to the users, making it available for whatever use. 
Bidirectional communication is implemented and the best 
route to navigate through venue calculated. The results show 
that the system makes possible not only the self-localization, 
but also to infer the travel direction and to interact with 
information received optimizing the route towards a static or 
dynamic destination.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version from the one presented 
in ALLSENSORS  2022 [1].  
Nowadays, wireless networks have seen a demand for 
increased data rate requirements. For a realistic coverage 
with the data rate requirements, a large bandwidth is needed 
which remains a limiting factor when compared with the RF 
communication technologies. Consequently, research has 
started 
exploring 
alternate 
wireless 
transmission 
technologies to meet the ever-increasing demand. In this 
context, the huge bandwidth available in the unlicensed 
electromagnetic spectrum in the optical domain is seen as a 
promising solution to the spectrum crunch.  
Visible Light Communication (VLC) makes use of the 
higher frequencies in the visual band and extends the 
capabilities of data transmission using general light sources. 
VLC has been regarded as an additional communication 
technology [2] [3] to fulfill the high data rate demands and 
as a new affiliate in the beyond fifth generation (5G) 
heterogeneous networks. It can be easily used in indoor 
environments using the existing LED lighting infrastructure 
with few modifications [4] [5]. Research has shown that 
compared to outdoors, people tend to lose orientation a lot 
easier within complex buildings [6] [7]. Fine-grained indoor 
localization can be useful, enabling several applications [8]  
[9].  
This work focuses on the use of VLC as a support for the 
transmission of information, providing advertising services 
and specific information to users. The goal is a cooperative 
system that supports guidance services and uses an edge/fog 
based architecture for wayfinding services. Here, the 
luminaire, through VLC, reports its geographical positions 
and specific information to the users since its infrastructure 
can also be reused to embed the fog nodes in them. The 
system is composed of several transmitters (LEDs 
luminaries), which send the map information and path 
messages required to wayfinding. Data is encoded, 
modulated and converted into light signals emitted by the 
transmitters. Every mobile terminal is equipped with a 
receiver module for receiving the mapped information 
generated from the ceiling light and displays this 
information in the mobile terminal. The receiver module 
includes a photodetector based on a tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H 
pin/pin light-controlled filter [10] [11].  
Visible light can be used as an ID system and can be 
employed for identifying the room number and the building 
itself. The main idea is to divide the service area into spatial

beams originating from the different ID light sources and 
identify each beam with a unique timed sequence of light 
signals. The signboards, based on arrays of LEDs, 
positioned in strategic directions to broadcast the 
information [12], are modulated acting as down- and up-link 
channels in the bidirectional communication. For the 
consumer services, the applications are enormous. The 
objective is to allow the implementation of new services in 
these areas using data from the VLC System, for indoor and 
outdoor. Positioning, navigation, security and even mission 
critical services are possible use cases that should be 
implemented.  
In this paper, a LED-supported guidance VLC system is 
proposed. After the Introduction, in Section II, the 
communication system is described. In Section III, the main 
experimental results are presented, downlink and uplink 
transmission is implemented and the best route to navigate 
calculated. In Section IV, the conclusions are drawn.

COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, DESIGN AND 
ARCHITECTURE 
The main goal is to specify the system conceptual design 
and define a set of use cases for a VLC based guidance 
system to be used by mobile users inside large buildings.

Figure 1. Block diagram and transmitters and receivers 3D relative 
positions.  
The block diagram and the transmitter and receiver 
relative positions are presented in Figure 1. Both 
communication modules are software defined, where 
modulation/ demodulation can be programed. 
Data from the sender is converted into an intermediate 
data representation, byte format, and converted into light 
signals emitted by the transmitter module. The data bit 
stream is input to a modulator where an ON–OFF Keying 
(OOK) modulation is utilized. On the transmission side, a 
modulation and conversion from digital to analog data is 
done. The driver circuit will keep an average value (DC 
power level) for illumination, combining it with the analog 
data intended for communication. The visible light emitted 
by the LEDs passes through the transmission medium and is 
then received by the MUX device.  
To realize both the communication and the building 
illumination, white light tetra-chromatic sources are used 
providing a different data channel for each chip. Each 
luminaire is composed of four white LEDs framed at the 
corners of a square (Figure 2). At each node, only one chip 
of the LED is modulated for data transmission, the Red (R: 
626 nm), the Green (G: 530 nm), the Blue (B: 470 nm) or 
the Violet (V). In Figure 2a, the spectra of the input 
channels is displayed.  
Data is encoded, modulated and converted into light 
signals emitted by the transmitters. Modulation and digital-
to-analog conversion of the information bits is done using 
signal processing techniques.

The signal is propagating through the optical channel, 
and a VLC receiver, at the reception end of the 
communication link, is responsible to extract the data from 
the modulated light beam. It transforms the light signal into 
an electrical signal that is subsequently decoded to extract 
the transmitted information. The obtained voltage is then

processed, by using 
signal conditioning 
techniques 
(adaptive bandpass filtering and amplification, triggering 
and demultiplexing), until the data signal is reconstructed at 
the data processing unit (digital conversion, decoding and 
decision) [13] [14]. At last, the message will be output to 
the users.  
In the receiving system, a MUX photodetector acts as an 
active 
filter 
for 
the 
visible 
spectrum. 
The 
VLC 
photosensitive receiver is a double pin/pin photodetector 
based on a tandem heterostructure, p-i'-n/p-i-n sandwiched 
between two conductive transparent contacts (Figure 2a). 
The front, thin pi’n structure made of a-SiC:H exhibits high 
absorption to short wavelengths (violet and blue light) and 
high transparency to the long wavelength (red light). In 
opposition, the back, thicker pin structure based on a-Si:H 
absorbs long wavelengths (red light), the green light is 
absorbed in both structures. The device selectivity is tuned 
externally using reverse bias (-8 V) and optical steady state 
illumination of short wavelength (400 nm). Exposed to 
light, the device offers high sensitivity and linear response, 
generating a proportional electrical current. Its quick 
response 
enables 
the 
possibility 
of 
high-speed 
communications. Since the photodetector response is 
insensitive to the frequency, phase, or polarization of the 
carriers, this kind of receiver is useful for intensity-
modulated signals. The generated photocurrent is processed 
using a transimpedance circuit obtaining a proportional 
voltage. Since the photodetector response is insensitive to 
the frequency, phase, or polarization of the carriers, this 
kind of receiver is useful for intensity-modulated signals. 
After receiving the signal, it is in turn filtered, amplified, 
and converted back to digital format for demodulation. The 
system controller consists of a set of programmable 
modules. 
In this system model, there are a few assumptions that 
should be noted: the channel state information is available 
both at the receiver and the transmitter; compared with the 
direct light, the reflected light is much weaker in the indoor 
VLC systems; only the Line OF Sight (LOS) path is 
considered and the multipath influence is not considered in 
the proposed indoor VLC system.  
The received channel can be expresssed as: 
 
 
where y represents the received signal, x the transmitted 
signal, μ is the photoelectric conversion factor which can be 
normalized as μ = 1, h is the channel gain and n is the 
additive white Gaussian noise of which the mean is 0. 
The LEDs are modeled as Lambertian sources where the 
luminance is distributed uniformly in all directions, whereas 
the luminous intensity is different in all directions. The 
luminous intensity for a Lambertian source is given by Eq. 
(2 ) [15]: 
 

IN is the maximum luminous intensity in the axial 
direction,  is the angle of irradiance and m is the order 
derived from a Lambertian pattern. For the proposed 
system, the commercial white LEDs were designed for 
illumination purposes, exhibiting a wide half intensity angle 
(1/2) of 60º. Thus, the Lambertian order m is 1. Friis’ 
transmission equation is frequently used to calculate the 
maximum range by which a wireless link can operate. The 
coverage map is obtained by calculating the link budget 
from the Friis Transmission Equation [ 16 ]. The Friis 
transmission equation relates the received power (PR) to the 
transmitted power (PE), path loss distance (LR), and gains 
from the emitter (GE) and receiver (GR) in a free-space 
communication link. 


Taking into account Figure 2a, the path loss distance and 
the emitter gain will be given by:  
 
 
 

With A de area of the photodetector and dE_R the distance 
between each transmitter and every point on the receiver 
plane. Due to their filtering properties of the receptors the 
gains are strongly dependent on the wavelength of the 
pulsed LEDs. Gains (GR) of 5, 4, 1.7 and 0.8 were used, 
respectively, for the R, G, B and V LEDs. IN of 730 mcd, 
650 mcd, 800 mcd and 900 mcd were considered.  
Taking into account Equations (1)-(5), the coverage map 
for a square unit cell is displayed in Figure 3a. All the 
values were converted to decibel (dB). 
On the receiving side, this is first done by a silicon 
carbide (SiC) pinpin MUX device that  acts as an active 
filter for the visible region of the light spectrum. After 
receiving the signal, it is in turn filtered, amplified, and 
converted back to digital format for demodulation. The 
system controller consists of a set of programmable 
modules. To receive the I2V information from several 
transmitters, the receiver must be located at the overlap of 
the circles that set the transmission range (radial) of each 
transmitter. The coverage map for a square unit cell is 
displayed in Figure 3. The LEDs are modeled as Lambertian 
sources where the luminance is distributed uniformly in all 
directions, whereas the luminous intensity is different in all 
directions [15]. The nine possible overlaps (#1-#9), defined 
as fingerprint regions, as well as receiver orientations (2-9 
steering angles; ) are also pointed out for the unit square 
cell in Figure 3a.

regions (#1-#9) and steering angle codes (2-9). 
The input of the aided navigation system is the coded 
signal sent by the transmitters to an identify user, and 
includes its position in the network P(x, y, z), inside the unit 
cell and the steering angle, , that guides the user across his 
path. The device receives multiple signals, finds the centroid 
of the received coordinates, and stores it as the reference 
point position. Nine reference points, for each unit cell, are 
identified giving a fine-grained resolution in the localization 
of the mobile device across each cell.  
Along with the robustness of the electronic devices used, 
modulation is also paramount to ensure the VLC systems’ 
performance and commercial viability. The core difference 
between 
VLC 
and 
regular 
RF 
(Radio-Frequency) 
communications is that VLC does not allow for amplitude 
and phase modulation techniques and must encode 
information by varying the intensity of emitted light.  
An OOK modulation scheme was used to code the 
information. In OOK, the data bits are transmitted by having 
the LED illuminating at different intensity levels. For 
example, having the LED at its maximum brightness (“on”) 
when transmitting the data bit ‘1’ and dimmed (“off”) when 
transmitting the data bit ‘0’, this way digital data is 
represented by the presence or absence of a carrier wave. 
The main advantage of OOK is its simplicity and 
subsequent ease of implementation, whereas its main 
limiting factor are low data rates further exacerbated in 
systems using different dimming levels. 
The obtained voltage is then processed, by using signal 
conditioning techniques (adaptive bandpass filtering and 
amplification, triggering and demultiplexing), until the data 
signal is reconstructed at the data processing unit (digital 
conversion, decoding and decision) [14].

Architecture

Multi-person 
Cooperative 
Localization   
Fog/Edge computing bridges the gap between the cloud 
and 
end 
devices 
by 
enabling 
computing, 
storage, 
networking, and data management on network nodes within 
the close vicinity of IoT devices. Fog computing has 
advantages since it provides moderate availability of 
computing 
resources 
at 
lower 
power 
consumption. 
Computing resources may be used for caching at the edge of 
the network, which enables faster retrieval of content and a 
lower burden on the front-haul. The edge is the immediate 
first hop from the IoT devices, such as the LiFi access 
points or gateways. In edge computing, the computation is 
done at the edge of the network through small data centers 
that are close to users. A mesh network is a good fit since it 
dynamically reconfigures itself and grows with the size of 
any installation. In Figure 4, the proposed architecture is 
illustrated.

Figure 4. Mesh and cellular hybrid architecture.  
The luminaires are equipped with one of two types of 
controllers: A “mesh” controller that connects with other 
nodes in its vicinity and can forward messages to other 
devices (I2D) in the mesh, effectively acting like routers 
nodes in the network. A “mesh/cellular” hybrid controller, 
that is also equipped with a modem providing IP base 
connectivity to the central manager services (I2CM). These 
nodes act as border-routers and can be used for edge 
computing. So, edge computing is located at the edge of the 
network close to end-user devices. 
Under this architecture, the short-range mesh network 
purpose is twofold: enable edge computing and device-to-
cloud communication, by ensuring a secure communication 
from a luminaire controller to the edge computer or 
datacenter (I2CM), through a neighbor luminaire/signboard 
controller with an active cellular connection; and enable 
peer-to-peer communication (I2I), to exchange information. 
It performs much of the processing on embedded computing 
platforms, directly interfacing to sensors and controllers. It

supports geo-distribution, local decision making, and real-
time load-balancing. Moreover, it depends on the 
collaboration of near-located end-user devices, instead of 
relying on the remote servers, which reduces the 
deployment costs and delay.  
 
C. 
Self-localization 
Self-localization is a fundamental issue since the person 
must be able to estimate its position and orientation (pose) 
within a map of the environment it is navigating. We 
consider the path to be a geometric representation of a plan 
to move from a start pose to a goal pose (Figure 2). Let us 
consider a person navigating in a 2D environment. Its non-
omnidirectional configuration is defined by position (x, y) 
and orientation angle , with respect to the coordinate axes. 
q(t) = [x(t), y(t), (t)] denote its pose at time t, in a global 
reference frame. In cooperative positioning systems, persons 
are divided into two groups, the stationary persons and the 
moving persons. Let us consider that qi(t,t´) represents the 
pose of person i at time t´ relative to the pose of the same 
person at time t and qij(t) denotes the pose of person j 
relative to the pose of person i at time t. qi(t,t´) is null for 
people standing still and non-zero if they move. These three 
types of information qi (t), qi (t,t´)and qij (t) compose the 
basic elements of a pose graph for multi-person cooperative 
localization. 
We consider that the risk of virus transmission exists if 
qij(t) is less than 2 m. The system will alert the users to stay 
away from those regions and to plan the better route to the 
desired wayfinding services. To estimate each person track 
the pure pursuit approach [17], [18] is used. The principle 
takes into account the curvature required for the mobile 
receiver to steer from its current position (t1) to its intended 
position (t2). By specifying a look-ahead distance, it defines 
the radius of an imaginary circle. Finally, a control 
algorithm chooses a steering angle in relation to this circle. 
This then allows to iteratively construct the intermediate 
arcs between itself and its goal position as it moved, thus, 
obtaining the required trajectory for it to reach its objective 
position. To avoid the risk of transmission, in the same 
frame of time and in known crowded regions, qij(t) is 
estimated and the steering angle readjusted [19].   
 
D. 
Scenario and building model 
A navigation system refers to one that can identify the 
geographical coordinates of a user or device through a 
variety of data collecting mechanisms such as network 
routing addresses or geolocation devices. Once obtained, 
these coordinates determine the location of the user and 
allow them to “navigate” the map of an unfamiliar area by 
informing them of where they are, where their destination is, 
and step-by-step directions on what is the best route to get 
there. When it comes to outdoor positioning, the GPS 
(Global Positioning System) has been the most common 
means of identifying a user’s location, such as when driving 
a vehicle. But when it comes to indoor navigation it is still 
far from maturity. The GPS cannot be relied on for this 
since satellite signals have trouble penetrating most 
buildings’ rooves, tunnels, or floors. 
When utilizing a navigation system, users wish to be 
guided on a direct, shortest path, to their destination based 
on their current position (starting point) and where they 
wish to go (destination point). For this purpose, VLC 
utilizes cells for positioning along with a CM (Central 
Manager) to keep track of everything and generate the 
optimal path.

meeting destination. It is believed this type of indoor 
location service would be most impactful in large-sized 
buildings with many points of interest and daily visitors, 
such as shopping malls and airports.  
Building a geometry model of buildings’ interiors is 
complex. Indoor VLC cell design is especially important 
since, being man-made, buildings such as these commonly 
follow basic shapes (squares, equilateral triangles/regular 
hexagons). 
In 
the 
proposed 
architecture 
each 
room/crossing/exit represents a node, and a path as the links 
between nodes. The proposed scenario is a multi-level 
building (Figure 5a). Lighting in large environments is 
designed to illuminate the entire space in a uniform way. 
Ceiling plans for the LED array layout, in floor level is 
shown in Figure 5b. A square lattice topology was 
considered for each level. A user navigates from outdoor to 
indoor. This topology is represented using x, y and z axes to 
simplify both the figure comprehension and the distance 
between any pair of nodes. In Figure 6 the 3D building 
model is depicted.

Figure 6. Illustration of the 3D optical scenario (RGBV =modulated 
LEDs spots). Row of cells in square topology.  
Each node emits light all around it and up to a certain 
range, which allows each cell to be divided into footprints 
depending on which LEDs are covering any given space 
(Figure 3a), thus allowing the system to determine the 
position of a user or device in any given cell, q(x,y,z,).  
A generated path to the end point can be viewed as a 
sequence of directions to nearby checkpoints that require the 
user to change their direction or steering angle (turning a 
corner, going around something, etc.). This means that a 
navigation system must also be able to identify the angle the 
user is moving in and the angle between the user and the 
next checkpoint (Figure 3b). 
The user sends a request message to find the right track 
(D2I, in Figure 4) and, in the available time, he adds 
customized points of interest (wayfinding services). The 
requested information (I2D) is sent by the emitters at the 
ceiling to its receiver. The indoor route throughout the 
building (track) is presented to the user by a responding 
message transmitted by the ceiling luminaires that work also 
either as router or mesh/cellular nodes. With this 
request/response concept, the generated landmark-based 
instructions help the user to unambiguously identify the 
correct decision point where a change of direction (pose) is 
needed, as well as offer information for the user to confirm 
that he/she is on the right way. 
III. 
GEOTRACKING, NAVIGATION AND ROUTE CONTROL  
Bi-directional communication between the infrastructure 
and the mobile receiver is analyzed. 
 
A. Communication 
protocol 
and 
coding/decoding 
techniques 
In order to ensure a synchronized and organized link 
between the user device and the various emitters, the use of 
a communication protocol for both encoding and decoding 
the shared data is important. To achieve this communication 
protocol, packets of bits are used, referred to as data frames, 
where its contents are formed from the required navigation 
data and arranged into several fields.  
To code the information, an On-Off Keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used, and it was considered a 
synchronous transmission based on a 64- bits data frame.

Frame length = 64 bits 
 
The frame is divided into three main blocks (Sync, 
Navigation data and Payload). The header block is the 
synchronization block [10101] This first block is named the 
header and refers to the starting bit sequence that is repeated 
in every data frame and allows the receiver to determine 
from an array of incoming bits where each frame begins. 
For this purpose, the same header bit sequence is imposed 
simultaneously to all emitters, in this case in an alternating 
“on”- “off” pattern [10101]. The second block contains the 
ID, 4+4+4 bits, gives the geolocation (x,y,z coordinates) of 
the emitters inside the array (Xi,j,k). These IDs were encoded 
using a 4-bit binary representation for the decimal number. 
The z coordinate refers to the floor number, which can be 
negative (ex: garages, machine rooms, warehouses, etc.) and 
is much less likely to reach double-digit values (skyscrapers 
being the most glaring exception); thus the first bit is used 
to represent the floor number’s sign (‘0’ when a positive 
number, ‘1’ when a negative number) and the remaining 
three bits indicating the coordinate’s value.

When bidirectional communication is required, the user 
must register by choosing a username (pin1) with 4 decimal 
numbers, each one associated to a RGBV channel. If buddy 
friend services are required a 4-binary code of the meeting 
(pin2) must be inserted. The  block (steering angle ()), a 4-
bit sequence, completes the user’s pose in a frame time 
q(x,y, , t). Eight steering angles along the cardinal points 
are possible from a start point to the next goal as pointed out 
as dotted arrows in Figure 5. The codes assigned to the pin2 
and to  are the same in all the channels. If no wayfinding 
services are required these last three blocks are set at zero 
and the user only receives its own location.  
The third and final block is named the payload and refers 
to sequence of bits that is not necessary for the navigation 
service. It is made up of miscellaneous data and followed by 
a stop bit. The frame payload starts with a sequence of bits 
that, while unnecessary for navigation, can be used to add 
more functionality to the indoor navigation service or even 
be used to improve the already existing one. The inclusion 
of a messaging service between users or a resending of one 
or more fields, are only two examples of how the payload 
can be used in a large-scale application. 
Based on the measured photocurrent signal by the 
photodetector, it is necessary to decode the information 
received. A calibration curve is previously defined to 
establish this assignment. In Figure 7a, it is plotted the 
calibration curve that uses 16 distinct photocurrent 
thresholds resultant from the combination of the RGBV 
modulated signals from VLC emitter. The correspondence 
between each 4-binary code and the photocurrent level is 
highlighted on the right side. Here, the MUX signal 
obtained at the receiver as well as the coded transmitted 
optical signals is displayed. The message, in the frame, 
starts with the header labelled as Sync, a block of 5 bits. The 
same 
synchronization 
header 
[10101] 
is 
imposed 
simultaneously to all emitters. In the second block, labelled 
as calibration, the bit sequence was chosen to allow all the 
on/off sixteen possible combinations of the four RGBV 
input channels (24). Finally, a random message was 
transmitted [20]. Comparing the calibrated levels (d0-d15) 
with the different assigned 4-digit binary [RGBV] codes, 
ascribed to each level, the decoding is straightforward, and 
the message decoded [21]. 
In Figure 7b, the MUX received signal and the decoding 
information that allows the VLC geotracking and guidance 
in successive instants (t0, t1, t2) from user “7261” guiding 
him along his track is exemplified. The visualized cells, 
paths, and the reference points (footprints) are also shown as 
inserts. Data shows that at t0 the network location of the 
received signals is R3,2,1, G3,1,1, B4,2,1 and V4,1,1, at t1 the user 
receives the signal only from the R3,2,1, B4,2,1 nodes and at t2 
he was moved to the next cell since the node G3,1,1 was 
added at the receiver. Hence, the mobile user “7261” begins 
his route into position #1 (t0) and wants to be directed to his 
goal position, in the next cell (# 9). During the route the 
navigator is guided to E (code 3) and, at t1, steers to SE  
(code 2), cross footprint #2 (t3) and arrives to #9. The 
ceiling lamps (landmarks) spread over all the building and 
act as edge/fog nodes in the network, providing well-
structured paths that maintain a navigator’s orientation with 
respect to both the next landmark along the path and the 
distance to the eventual destination. Also, the VLC dynamic 
system enables cooperative and oppositional geolocation. In 
some cases, it is in the user’s interest to be accurately 
located, so that they can be offered information relevant to 
their location and orientation (pin 1, pin2 and  blocks). In 
other cases, users prefer not to disclose their location for 
privacy, in this case these last three blocks are set at zero 
and the user only receives its own location.

Due to the proximity of successive levels occasional 
errors occur in the decoded information. A parity check is 
performed after the word has been read [22]. The parity bits 
are the SUM bits of the three-bit additions of violet pulsed 
signal with two additional RGB bits and defined as:

Error control assigned to a request from user “7261” at C4,3,1; #1 N. 
In Figure 8a, the MUX signal that arises from the 
transmission of the four calibrated RGBV wavelength 
channels and the MUX signal that results from the 
generation of the synchronized parity MUX are displayed. 
On the top the seven bit word [R,G,B,V, PR, PG, PB] of the 
transmitted inputs guides the eyes. The colors red, green, 
blue and violet were assigned respectively to PR, PG and PB. 
For simplicity the received data (d0-15 levels) is marked in 
the correspondent MUX slots as well as the parity levels 
marked as horizontal lines. On the top the decoded 7-bit 
coded word is exhibited. In the right side 4-bit binary codes 
assigned to the eight parity sublevels are inserted.  
The traffic message is revealed by decoding MUX 
signals and considering the framestructure, pose, and 
transmitter type [19]. In Figure 8b, we illustrate how error 
control is achieved using check parity bits. A request from 
user "7261" is shown at C4,3,1; #1 N, along with the 
matching parity signal. Results show that without check 
parity bits, decoding was difficult primarily when levels 
were close together (dotted arrow). 
The study of optical interference was also briefly 
attempted and how it can affect a VLC communication link. 
Three types of optical sources were chosen due to their 
availability and their likelihood of existing near a real-world 
indoor VLC system: halogen light, fluorescent light, and 
LED light. Measuring the intensity of each optical source at 
R (624 nm), G (540 nm), B (480 nm) and V (405 nm) 
wavelengths, without optical interference as a reference 
point, the RGBV (Red-Green-Blue-Violet) components of 
each optical source raises or lowers the light gain at those 
wavelengths. As the calibration curve is used to define the 
16 possible levels (d0-d15, Figure 7), optical interferences 
are negligible. A wide range of factors influence optical 
interference (such as angle of incidence, optical aperture, 
luminous intensity, etc.) and, while some success has been 
observed in nullifying the disruptive effects of optical 
interference on decoding with the signal-to-bit algorithm, 
the results were based on specific optical sources measured 
under certain non-rigorous conditions. Before any concrete 
conclusions can be drawn about the full impact of optical 
interference on a VLC system and how it can be minimized 
or counteracted, further studies will be necessary to 
complement these results. 
 
B. Multi-person cooperative localization and guidance 
services 
Bi-directional communication between VLC emitters 
and receivers is available at a VLC ready handheld device, 
through the control manager interconnected with a 
signboard receiver located at each unit cells (#1). These 
communications channels constitute the uplink (D2I) and 
downlink channels (I2D). Each user (D2I) sends to the local 
controller a “request” message with the pose, qi (t), (x,y,z, ), 
user code (pin1) and also adds its needs (code meeting and 
wayfinding data). For route coordination the CM, using the 
information of the network’s VLC location capability, sends 
a personalized “response” message to each client at the 
requested pose with his wayfinding needs.

Figure 9. MUX/DEMUX signals assigned requests from two users (“3009” 
and “7261”) at different poses (C4,4,,1; #1W and C2,3,-1; #6 W ) and in 
successive instants (t1 and t3). 
In Figure 9, the MUX synchronized signals received by 
two users that have requested wayfinding services, at 
different times, are displayed. We have assumed that a user 
located at C2,3,-1,  arrived first (t1), auto-identified as 
("7261") and informed the controller of his intention to find 
a friend for a previously scheduled meeting (code 3). A 
buddy list is then generated and will include all the users 
who have the same meeting code. User “3009” arrives later 
(t3), sends the alert notification (C4,4,1; t3) to be triggered 
when his friend is in his floor vicinity, level 1, identifies 
himself (“3009”) and uses the same code (code 3), to track 
the best way to his meeting. 
After this request (t3), the buddy finder service uses the 
location information from both user’ devices to determine 
the proximity of their owners (qij (t)) and sends a response 
message with the best route to the meeting.

Figure 10. Graphical representation of the simultaneous localization and 
mapping problem using connectivity as a function of node density, mobility 
and transmission range. 
The pedestrian movement along the path can be thought 
as a queue, where the pedestrians arrive at a path, wait if the 
path is congested and then move once the congestion 
reduces. 
In Figure 10, a graphical representation of the 
simultaneous localization and mapping problem using 
connectivity as a function of node density, mobility and 
transmission range is illustrated. The following parameters 
are therefore needed to model the queuing system: The 
initial arrival time (t0) and the path, respectively, defined as 
the time when the pedestrian leaves the previous path and 
the actual movement along the path, qi (t, t’). Here, the 
service time is calculated using walking speed and distance 
of the path.  
The number of service units or resources is determined 
from the capacity of the path, n(qi (x,y,z, , t))  and walking 
speed that depends on the number of request services, and 
on the direction of movement along the path qi (x,y,z, , t). 
Since the number of service units is same as the capacity of 
the path, the queue size is theoretically zero.  
Once appended by the CM (request message), the 
pedestrians are served immediately (response message). If 
the number of pedestrians exceeds the path capacity, a 
backlog is automatically formed until the starting node. The 
hybrid controller integrates the number of requests and 
individual positions received during the same time interval. 
Once the individual positions are known, qi (t), the relative 
positions are calculated, qij (t). If the relative position is less 
than a threshold distance, a crowded region locally exists, 
and an alert message is sent for the users. This alert allows 
the CM to recalculate, in real time, the best route for the 
users, qi (t,t´), that request wayfinding services avoiding 
crowded regions.

figure, the decoded information is shown and the simulated 
scenario is inserted to guide the eyes.  
The “request” message includes, beyond synchronism, 
the identification of the user (“3009”), its address and 
orientation (C4,4,1, #1W) and the help requested (Wayfinding 
Data). Since a meet-up between users is expected, its code 
was inserted before the right track request. In the 
“response”, the block CM identifies the sender [0000] and 
the next blocks the cell address (C4,4,1), the user (3009) for 
which the message is intended and finally the requested 
information: meeting code 3, orientation NE (code 4) and 
wayfinding instructions. Every time a user switches floors 
he has to notify the CM and a new alert is received to 
optimize the way. In response to the estimated relative pose 
position, qi,j (t), between the users with the same meeting 
code, the CM sends a new alert that takes into account the 
occupancy of the service areas along the paths, qi (x,y,z, , 
t), which optimizes the path without crowding the users.

In Figure 12, the decoded messages from the two users 
as they travel to the pre-scheduled meeting is displayed. At 
the botton the geolocation of both user is illustrated. 
Decoded data shows that user “7621” starts (t1) his 
journey on floor -1, C2,3,-1; #1W, goes up to floor 1 in C2,1,-1 
and at t2 he arrives at C4,1,1  heading for E. During his 
journey, user “3009” from C4,4,1 #1 asks the CM (t3) to 
forward him to the scheduled meeting and follows course to 
W. At t4 both friends join in C4,3,1. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A cooperative indoor VLC localization and navigation 
system is proposed. In a multi-level building scenario, the 
architecture 
of 
the 
system 
and 
the 
protocol 
of 
communication were defined. Bi-directional communication 
between the infrastructure and the mobile receiver was 
analyzed.  
According to global results, the location of a mobile 
receiver is found in conjunction with data transmission. 
VLC's dynamic LED-aided navigation system is designed to 
give users accurate route guidance and enable navigation 
and geotracking. The multi-person cooperative localization 
system detects crowded regions and alerts the user to 
reschedule meetups, as well as provides guidance 
information. With those alerts, the CM can recalculate, in 
real time, the best route for users requesting wayfinding 
services, avoiding crowded areas.
