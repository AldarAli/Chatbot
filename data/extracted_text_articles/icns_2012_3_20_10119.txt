Abstract—IEEE 802.16j relay networks can provide wide-
area wireless broadband service. In these networks, the loca-
tions of relay nodes and the topology are important factors in
achieving high performance. In particular, radio wave inter-
ference must be considered when establishing node locations.
However, nodes are generally deployed in limited areas and
cannot be moved to arbitrary positions. In this paper, we
propose a node repositioning method that works within these
constraints to improve network performance and that utilizes
only topology information. Since the computational cost is high
for assessing all possible node positions, the proposed method
limits the number of candidate nodes to be repositioned on the
basis of topology information. We examine the effectiveness
of the proposed method through simulation experiments and
show that a performance improvement of up to 28% is realized
and nearly optimal results are obtained, but at much lower
computational cost than an exhaustive search.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless relay networks based on IEEE 802.16j [1] are
now attracting considerable attention since they can provide
wide-area network service at a low cost to metropolitan
areas or areas in which the construction of wired networks is
difﬁcult [2]. An IEEE 802.16j network consists of two types
of nodes: gateway nodes and relay nodes [3]. A gateway
node is wired to an external network. On the other hand, a
relay node is not directly wired to the external network and
instead connects via wireless links that form a multi-hop
relay network whose root is the gateway node (Figure 1).
One advantage of this type of network is that the service
area can be extended easily and the network capacity can
be increased by adding relay nodes [4].
In wireless networks, a general problem is that commu-
nication links that interfere with each other cannot com-
municate at the same time [5], [6]. IEEE 802.16j networks
solve the radio wave interference problem by adopting the
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
scheme [7], which is a scheduling mechanism based on
the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and FDMA

schemes [8]. In this scheduling method, time slots are
assigned to each communication link as transmission op-
portunities according to its trafﬁc demands. The links that
interfere with each other use different time slots and the
links that do not interfere with each other use the same
time slots to increase spatial reuse of radio resources [9],
[10]. To decrease the number of assigned time slots is
important for achieving high performance in these networks
and radio wave interference must be taken into account when
positioning the nodes to reduce the number. In general,
however, nodes are deployed in limited areas and cannot
be moved to arbitrary positions. An example is shown in
Figure 1, where nodes are set up on the roofs of buildings
in an urban area and a node can be moved within only the
roof area.
In this paper, we propose a node repositioning method that
works within such constraints to improve the performance of
IEEE 802.16j relay networks. Our proposed method utilizes
only topology information to determine which nodes are
repositioned. Furthermore, we limit the number of nodes
to be repositioned since the computational cost is high for
assessing all possible node positions.
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method
through simulation experiments where the number of time
slots assigned to all links in the network is taken as the
assessment criterion. We also show the results of evaluating

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we explain the network model and the time slot
assignment algorithm. Then, we propose the node reposi-
tioning method in Section III. In Section IV, we evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation
experiments. Finally, we present the conclusions of this
paper and areas of future research.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we describe the IEEE 802.16j relay
network model, radio wave interference model, and time slot
assignment method which we employ in this study.
A. IEEE 802.16j relay network model
The network model consists of one gateway node and
multiple relay nodes. These nodes form a multi-hop relay
network whose root is the gateway node (Figure 2). The
network topology is constructed such that all relay nodes
reach the gateway node via the minimum number of hops.
After determining the topology, each node sets its own
transmission range to the minimum value for maintaining
its link. This adjustment of transmission range helps in
reducing power consumption and radio wave interference.
In this paper, we consider only downstream transmission
from the gateway node to relay nodes.
B. Radio wave interference model
Here, we explain the model of radio wave interference
between links. Figure 3 shows the situation where link li,j
between nodes vi and vj interferes with link lp,q between
nodes vp and vq. Here, vi and vp are sender nodes, and
vj and vq are receiver nodes. The transmission range of vi
is ti. We deﬁne the interference ratio as γ, and thus the
interference range ri of vi is represented as γ · ti.
In Figure 3, vq is located within the interference range ri
of vi, which is expressed with parameters as ||vi − vq|| <
ri (||vi − vj|| means the physical distance between vi and
vj). When li,j and lp,q transmit data at the same time, vq
cannot correctly receive the signal from vp since vq receives

radio waves from both vi and vp simultaneously. In this
case, li,j interferes with lp,q. Additionally, we deﬁne the
interference relationship between li,j and lp,q as the situation
where either li,j interferes with lp,q or lp,q interferes with
li,j. These two conditions are represented as ||vi −vq|| < ri
and ||vp − vp|| < rp. In other words, when ||vi − vq|| < ri
or ||vp − vp|| < rp is satisﬁed, the radio wave interference
occurs between li,j and lp,q.
C. Time slot assignment algorithm
IEEE 802.16j relay networks resolve the radio interfer-
ence problem by employing the TDMA scheme. In such
networks, time slots are assigned to links as transmission
opportunities. For high network performance, it is important
to assign different time slots to links that interfere with
each other, and to assign the same time slots to links that
do not interfere with each other. In this paper, we utilize
the scheduling algorithm proposed in [10]. The algorithm
assigns time slots to links in the network in accordance with
their trafﬁc demands by treating the time slot assignment
problem as a vertex coloring problem [11].
III. NODE REPOSITIONING METHOD
In this section, we explain the method to reposition
relay nodes under movement range constraints. We assume
that the initial positions of relay nodes are determined
beforehand, and that we can move certain relay nodes to
improve network performance. We take the movement of a
node to be constrained within a certain range centered on the
node’s initial position. In what follows, we ﬁrst explain the
algorithm to determine the repositioning of one node. We
then describe how to reposition multiple nodes to further
improve network performance.
A. One-node repositioning
In repositioning one node, the selection of the node to be
repositioned is important. The target node is determined as
follows. We ﬁrst select a candidate node to be repositioned
and ﬁnd its position that gives the best network performance
from all the possible positions. We repeat this process for all

candidate nodes and ﬁnd the node and its movement which
lead to the best network performance.
However, the computational cost is too large to check all
nodes as candidate nodes. Here, we propose limiting the
number of candidate nodes according to their distance from
the gateway node, as shown in Figure 4. We categorize the
candidate nodes as follows. First, nodes that are directly
connected to the gateway node are categorized as group 1.
Then, the nodes that are not directly connected to the
gateway node, but that can be connected to the gateway
node by repositioning, are categorized as group 2.
By setting this constraint on the nodes to be checked, we
can substantially decrease the computational cost, especially
when the number of relay nodes in the network is large.
B. Repositioning of multiple nodes
When we reposition multiple nodes to further improve
the network performance, we can consider two approaches:
parallel repositioning and serial repositioning.
In parallel repositioning, we consider all the possible
positions of multiple nodes. Doing so gives the optimal
solution for the repositioning of multiple nodes but at a high
computational cost that increases greatly with the number of
repositioned nodes.
On the other hand, in serial repositioning, we sequen-
tially apply the one-node repositioning method described in
Section III-A. This strategy can be regarded as a simple hill-
climbing heuristic[12]. Therefore, the computational cost
is lower in comparison with parallel repositioning, but the
global optimal solution might not be found.
In Section IV, we compare the serial and parallel methods
and show that serial repositioning is effective in terms of
both computational cost and network performance.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the node
repositioning method proposed in Section III through simu-
lation experiments.
A. Simulation settings and performance metrics
We perform simulation experiments under the following
conditions. A gateway node is deployed at the center of
a 1 × 1 ﬁeld, and 9, 29 or 49 relay nodes are randomly
deployed. We refer to these three setups as the 10-node net-
work, 30-node network, and 50-node network, respectively.
The maximum transmission range of the gateway node and
the relay nodes are set to 0.56 for the 10-node network, 0.32
for the 30-node network, and 0.25 for the 50-node network,
so that no relay node is disconnected from the network in
the initial setup. The radio interference ratio γ is set to 2.
The movement range is set to 1/10 of the maximum trans-
mission range. When moving one node, we consider three
methods for establishing the candidate positions as shown
in Figure 5. These three methods differ in the resolution of
the positions. We can expect that a ﬁner resolution will give
better network performance but at a higher computational
cost.
The trafﬁc demand from each node depends on the size
of the Voronoi diagram [13] of the node. The number of
time slots necessary for each link is determined according
to the trafﬁc demands. Time slots are assigned to the links
by the algorithm proposed in [10]. The number of time
slots assigned to all links in the network is called the frame
length. The frame length is an important metric of network
performance, and a smaller value corresponds to higher
network performance.
The change in network performance from repositioning is
evaluated in terms of frame length ratio, which is the ratio
of the frame length of the repositioned network divided by
that of the original network. We conducted 100 simulation
experiments for each parameter setting and evaluate the
distribution of the frame length ratio. We also measured the
time required to perform the calculation in order to evaluate
the computational cost.
B. Effect of movement resolution
We ﬁrst evaluate the effect of movement resolution (Fig-
ure 5) on the performance of one-node repositioning. Here,
we move only one node in a 10-node network.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of frame length ratio for
100 simulation experiments. Nearly the same result was
obtained for all movement resolutions. This means that the
coarsest resolution is adequate when calculating one-node
movement. Therefore, we use the coarsest resolution in the
following experiments.
C. Performance of one-node repositioning
We evaluated the performance of one-node repositioning
in more detail. Speciﬁcally, we investigated the effect of lim-
iting the number of candidate nodes, as shown in Figure 4.
The frame length ratios obtained using the proposed method
with only group 1, only group 2, and both groups 1 and 2 are
compared with the ratio obtained using the method where

every node is checked. Note that checking all nodes gives
the global optimal solution for one-node repositioning.
Figure 7 shows the distributions of frame length ratio from
100 simulation experiments for the 10-node network, 30-
node network, and 50-node network. The result of one-node
repositioning using only group 1 or 2 is far from optimal,
but repositioning with both groups 1 and 2 is nearly optimal.
Furthermore, the result remains unchanged, 5–7% average
improvement in the frame length ratio, regardless of the
number of relay nodes in the network.
These results indicate that compared with the exhaustive
search method, the proposed one-node repositioning method
can decrease the frame length substantially at a lower
computational cost.
D. Multiple node repositioning
We next evaluate the performance of multiple node repo-
sitioning. In detail, we compare the performance of parallel
repositioning with all nodes being candidate nodes (giving
optimal results), and the serial repositioning with candidate
nodes limited to groups 1 and 2. By using the 30-node
network, we move 2–3 nodes in the parallel method and 2–
9 nodes in the serial method. Note that we cannot execute
the simulation experiment of the parallel method using more
than 4 repositioned nodes since the calculation time is too
large.
Figure 8 shows the distributions of frame length ratio
from 100 simulation experiments with 2–3 nodes being
repositioned. We can observe from this ﬁgure that as the
number of repositioned nodes increased, the results from the
serial repositioning method with both groups 1 and 2 became
slightly worse than the optimal results. However, consider-
ably better results were obtained from serially positioning
using both groups 1 and 2 than from serial repositioning with
group 1 or group 2 alone. These results show that limiting
the candidate nodes to both groups 1 and 2 is still effective,
even in multiple node repositioning.
Furthermore, serial repositioning has a large advantage in
terms of computational cost. In Figure 9, we plot the calcu-
lation times of the parallel and serial repositioning methods,
which were executed on a PC with four 2.93 GHz quad-core
CPUs and 64 GB of memory. This ﬁgure clearly shows the
small computational cost of the serial repositioning method.
Figure 10 shows the distribution of frame length ratio
from 100 simulation experiments using the serial reposi-
tioning method with 1–9 nodes being repositioned in the
30-node network. The results show little change for more
than 5 nodes being repositioned. In addition, by using the
serial repositioning method with 9 nodes, the frame length
ratio was improved by up to 28% and 10% on average,
which is almost the same as the result of the parallel
repositioning method with 3 nodes (Figure 11), while the
calculation time is quite small as shown in Figure 9. We can
conclude from these results that, by the proposed method,
serial repositioning with a portion of the nodes is sufﬁcient
for realizing a notable performance improvement.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed a node repositioning method to
improve the performance of IEEE 802.16j relay networks. A
low computational cost in multiple node repositioning was
realized by limiting the number of candidate nodes and by
repositioning multiple nodes in series. The proposed method
achieves sufﬁcient effectiveness by repositioning a small
number of relay nodes and brings about a nearly optimal

In future work, we will consider ways to further improve
the serial repositioning method. We will also evaluate the
effects on upstream link and the effectiveness of the pro-
posed method with more accurate radio interference models
such as the signal-to-interference noise ratio model [14].
