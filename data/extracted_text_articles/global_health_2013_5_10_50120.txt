Abstract—We are developing a passive power assist supporter
called Smart Suit Lite. Smart Suit Lite is a compact and
lightweight power assist device that utilizes the elastic force of
elastic belts. To design the Smart Suit Lite, we developed a
motion-based assist method and an extended musculoskeletal
model. The motion-based assist method was used to design the
arrangements and properties of the elastic belts by utilizing the
relation between the target motions and the corresponding
muscle forces. To analyze the assistive forces provided by the
elastic belts, skin segments that represent the surface of the
human body features the extended musculoskeletal model and
can reproduce changes in length of the body surface with
changes in posture. In this study, we used the developed
method to produce the Smart Suit Lite for care workers.
Furthermore,
through
the
"trial
experiment"
in
this
experiment,
we
found
that
wear
comfort
was
strongly
correlated with the assistance perceived by the user. Thus, we
have improved the Smart Suit Lite from the aspect of wear
comfort and verified the enhancement of the assistance
provided by the device. In user testing, 90% of the participants
reported a decrease in load on the low back during care work.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, rapid aging of the population in many
developed countries has led to increased demand for care
workers. As a consequence, the physical burden placed on
care workers by strenuous tasks and heavy workloads has
become a severe problem. Minematsu [1] reported that half
of care workers experience back problems. The main causes
of low back pain, in particular, are overloading and bad
posture [2]. In performing lifting tasks during routine duties,
care workers tend to bend deeply at the waist, and the load
on the low back is great [3]. Therefore, a power assist device
for the low back muscles should be effective in not only
reducing fatigue but also preventing lumbar disease.
Recently,
many
power
assist
devices
have
been
developed. In particular, wearable assist systems have
attracted
considerable
interest.
Many
of
them
are
exoskeleton-type systems such as HAL [4], Muscle Suit [5]
and BLEEX [6]. These exoskeleton suits are able to
generate a large assistive force, but are weighty and large,
owing to the necessity of both a power source and a number
of actuators. On the other hand, some small and light-weight
power suits have been developed, for example, Back Muscle
Supporter [7], Simple Supporter [8] and Assist Suit [9].
Such devices utilize only passive force, and are designed to
reduce the burden placed on the wearer.
In our laboratory, we have been developing a passive
power assist supporter Smart Suit Lite (SSL) as one of
KEIROKA assistive device. The device utilizes elastic force
generated by elastic belts, and thus is safe, easy to use and
suitable for nursing care applications. Because SSL does not
have a control mechanism, the assistance provided by the
system is determined in the design phase. Therefore, this
study aims to design elastic belts and optimize the assistance
provided for target motions.
Herein, we describe the design method of SSL, and
report designs of elastic properties and arrangements of
elastic belts for care work. Furthermore, trial experiments
were conducted in a hospital and improvements based on the
results are reported.

KEIROKA TECHNOLOGY
KEIROKA is a concept of assistive technologies. It does
not only aim to reduce user’s fatigue, but also achieve the
following:
(1) secure assist for users and surroundings.
(2) sustainable assist to keep user’s physical and mental
performance.
(3) subliminal assist to keep user’s natural motion. Smart
suit is one of KEIROKA wearable assist devices designed
by the above concepts. This paper describes the design
methodology of smart suit lite for nursing workers and its
results of field test.

SMART SUIT LITE
Figure 1 shows a prototype of SSL. The elastic belts are
arranged to connect the thighs and shoulders to the back, as
shown in the figure. Furthermore, SSL is able to fit closely
to the wearer's body and the assistive force is set according
to the expected workload by adjusting the initial lengths of
the elastic belts. Figure 2 shows a schematic side view of
the device, and illustrates the assist mechanism in two
dimensions; one of the elastic belts is shown. The elastic
belt of the upper body
and the elastic belt of the thigh
are connected by a movable pulley at point

thus the assistive torque

posture that corresponds to higher load on the low back.

DESIGN OF ELASTIC BELTS USING MOTION-BASED-
ASSIST METHOD
A.
Algorithm
The motion-based assist method is a design method
based on models of the relation between the target motions
and muscle forces. In this study, we design the elastic belts
of SSL by using this method, which consists of the
following steps.
Step1 Determine the sites and motions to be assisted.
Step2 Measure the target motions
in three dimensions with a motion capture system. Here,
is the number of sampling points;
is posture
measured at time
. (
is the sampling period).
Step3 Calculate muscle forces
in the target sites and
moment arms
for each degree of freedom by
analyzing the motion
with a dynamic musculoskeletal
model
. Then, calculate human joint torque
from
and
.

Step4
For arrangement
of the elastic belts, calculate
the change in length of the elastic belts (
) and the
moment arm of the elastic belts (
) through analysis
using a geometric skin segment model
and the
motion
.

Step5 By repeating Step 4 for each arrangement, find the
maximum
assistive
torque
,
and
determine
the
arrangement
. Spring constant
is assumed to be
constant in this step.

Step6
Assuming that the assistance is provided by
projection of the assistive torque
to the human joint
torque
, determine the
desired elastic modulus
from

assistive ratio
.
(10)
Step7
Calculate the elastic property curve
from
elastic modulus
and the change in length
by fitting the
data to following expression:
(11)
where
and
are coefficients of the elastic property.
In this manner, the arrangement and property of the elastic
belts are designed.
B.
Skin Segment Model
To analyze the assistive force during motions, we
developed a skin segment model that represents the body
surface as shown in
Fig.3 (a). We can calculate the
changes in length of the elastic belts along the body surface
by modeling the relation between posture and the shape of
the body surface. To represent the elongation of skin
covering the lumbar area, lumbar segments shown in
Fig.3(b)
are
divided
into
segments
–
,
which
correspond to the lumbar vertebrae (
–
), and each
segments is given coordinates
–
. In conjunction
with lumbar angle
, which consists of flexion
, lateral
flexion
and rotation
, skin segments move with
respect to the pelvis at
according to the following
homogeneous transformation matrix.

Then,
there are gaps between segments as shown in Figure 3 (b).
The change in length,
, of a path along the body surface is
the sum of the change in length between each pair of
adjacent segments (i.e.,
).
(14)
The size of the skin segments and transformation matrix
can be adjusted with parameters, and thus a model can be
prepared to suit the wearer.

DESIGN OF SMART SUIT LITE FOR CARE WORK
A.
Target Motions for Assistance
In this study, common tasks performed around patient's
bed in care work were selected as the target motions. Figure
4 shows the selected motions. In preliminary experiment,
these tasks were found to place a larger load on lumbar
muscles compared with muscles in other regions. We took
lumbar muscles to be the main assist target.
B.
Design of Elastic Belt Arrangement
In Steps 4 and 5 of the Motion-based assist method, we
designed the arrangement of the elastic belts to provide
effective
assistance
to
lumbar
muscles.
Here,
design
parameters are via points
and
on the waist belt curve
of the elastic belts (Figure. 5). Via points are symmetrically
shifted from -150[mm] to 150[mm] in increments of
30[mm], such that 11 arrangement patterns are defined
(
).
(15)
Using these arrangements, we performed simulations of
assistive torque during the motions of care work. First,
motion capture and inverse dynamics analysis were carried
out in Step 2 and 3 of the motion-based assist method.
Table I shows the conditions of the motion capture
experiment. Next, simulations of assistive torque were
performed for
[N/m]. Below, we define the torque
assist ratio as a measure for evaluating the provided
assistance.
(16)
Here,
is assistive torque and
is human joint torque.
Selected simulation results are shown in Figure 7. The
highest assist rate was found in arrangement
(Figure 6).
Thus, this arrangement of elastic belts was selected for
further investigation.

TRIAL EXPERIMENT
A.
Experimental Conditions
To investigate the utility of SSL in the field, we
performed a trial experiment at a hospital. Tables II and III
show the details of the experiment. Participants wore SSL
during working hours for five days and completed a
questionnaire each day.
Figure 8 shows a representative
scene from the trial experiment.

Results
1.
Feeling of fatigue
Participants evaluated fatigue before and after work on
the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The increases in fatigue
due to work was compared between work done while
wearing SSL and work done while not wearing SSL.
To do this, the increase in VAS for work with SSL was
subtracted from the increase in VAS for work without SSL.
Table IV shows the results. With respect to the mean for all
participants, there is no significant difference in the amount
of change in VAS. Next, we divide the participants into
groups by comfort while wearing SSL (comfortable, 7;
uncomfortable, 13). For the group of participants who feel
comfortable while wearing SSL, the amount of change in
VAS is significantly lower.
2.
Load on low back during various tasks
In the questionnaire, the participants were asked whether
SSL was effective for performing various tasks. Figure 9
shows the results. More than half of the participants in the
comfortable group responded that SSL was effective for all
the tasks. On the other hand, more than half of the
participants in the uncomfortable group indicated that SSL
was ineffective.
From these results, we can see that the subjective
evaluation of the assistance provided by SSL depends on
wear comfort. Causes of poor wear comfort include heat,
tight fit and friction. By improving wear comfort, SSL can
potentially receive better evaluations of its effectiveness in
providing assistance.

SECOND TRIAL EXPERIMENT
A.
Improvement
In response to the first trial experiment, we improved
SSL as follows ( Figure 10).
1. The neck hole was widened to avoid rubbing against
the neck.
2.
The vest was made larger to resolve a feeling of
pressure.
3.
A part of the vest was changed to a stretchable
material to fit the wearer's body.

B.
Experimental Conditions
To evaluate the effects of these improvements, we
performed another trial experiment. Tables V and VI show
the details of the experiment. Participants wore the old SSL
and the improved SSL respectively, and evaluated fatigue
due to work. In addition, because the assistive forces and
mass of the improved SSL were almost the same as those of
the old SSL, only the effects of wear comfort should reflect
in the difference in the effectiveness of assistance.
C.
Results
1. Wear comfort
Figure 11 (a) shows results for evaluation of wear
comfort at three levels ("good", "normal" and "poor"). The
number participants who indicated that wear comfort was
"poor" decreased 25 percentage points in comparison with
the old SSL. Therefore, a notable improvement in the wear
comfort of SSL was achieved.
2. Lumbar load
Participants evaluated the effectiveness of SSL in
reducing the load on the low back on a six-point scale (0,
"not at all effective"; 5, "very effective").
Figure 12 (b)
shows the results. The mean score increased from 2.7 for the
old SSL to 3.2 for the improved SSL. Therefore, SSL was
notably improved in terms of the subjective reduction in
load on the low back. In addition, participants evaluated
fatigue on VAS as in the first trial experiment. The increase
in average VAS value for work performed while wearing
the old SSL was 16.4, whereas in the case of the improved
SSL, this increase was 5.9; thus, for the improved SSL,
suppression of the fatigue increase was 64.0% that for the
old SSL.
The above results show that a significant improvement
in the subjective effectiveness was achieved by improving
the wear comfort of SSL. Therefore, the structure, materials
and size variation of SSL should be further considered in the
future.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced a design method of Smart
Suit Lite using a motion-based assist method, and designed
and evaluated Smart Suit Lite for care workers.
Aiming to achieve an assist ratio of 25%, we developed
a skin segment model for analyzing the change in length of
the
surface
of
the
human
body,
and
designed
the
arrangement and properties of the elastic belts of SSL for
care workers. In addition, we have manufactured Smart Suit
Lite in accordance with the above mentioned designs for
elasticity properties and arrangements, and we have veriﬁed 
its assistive effects through basic experiments. The results of
the experiments show an average reduction of 24% in the
amount of activation of the erector spinae muscle, proving
the effectiveness of the power assistance device. Moreover,

20 care workers at a hospital wore SSL while performing
their duties, and evaluated its effectiveness in providing
assistance. Poor wear comfort was found to lead to low
subjective
effectiveness
of
assistance.
Therefore,
we
modified the SSL with the aim of improving wear comfort.
As a result, 90% of participants reported a reduction in load
on the low back. The subjective feeling of fatigue was found
to
depend
on
various
factors
including
comfort
and
habituation, and thus further long-term evaluations will be
necessary in order for SSL to be used routinely.
