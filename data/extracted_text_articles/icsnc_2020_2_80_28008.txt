Abstract—Communication in the millimeter-wave (mmWave)
band has recently been proposed to enable giga-bit-per-second
data rates for next generation wireless systems. Physical layer
security techniques have emerged as a simple and yet effective
way to safeguard these systems against eavesdropping attacks.
These techniques make use of the large antenna arrays available
in mmWave systems to provide an array gain at the target re-
ceiver and degrade the signal quality at the eavesdropper. Despite
their effectiveness, the majority of these techniques are based on
line-of-sight communication links between the transmitter and the
receiver, and may fail in the presence of blockages or non-line-
of-sight links. This paper builds upon previous work and extends
physical layer security to the non-line-of-sight communication
case and randomly located eavesdroppers. Speciﬁcally, the large
dimensional antenna arrays in mmWave systems and the intrinsic
characteristics of wireless channel are exploited to induce noise-
like signals that jam eavesdroppers with sensitive receivers.
Numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide
higher secrecy rate when compared to conventional array and
physical layer techniques based on line-of-sight links.

INTRODUCTION
The abundance of bandwidth in the millimeter-wave
(mmWave) band enables high-speed, low latency, commu-
nication to support next generation systems [1]-[3]. These
systems rely on directional communication with large antenna
arrays to achieve sufﬁcient link budget [4][5]. Securing these
systems against eavesdropping and privacy attacks is one major
challenge [6]-[8].
Security in wireless communications can be mainly
grouped into cryptographic and Physical Layer Security (PLS)
strategies, where the previous incorporates key-based ap-
proaches normally applied at higher system layers. The limited
transmit RF-chains, higher path-loss, and directional commu-
nication requirement of mmWave systems, however, makes
the implementation of classical cryptographic techniques in-
efﬁcient for these systems [4][8][9]. For this reason, physical
layer security has emerged as a simple but yet effective way to
secure these systems and complement key-based cryptographic
techniques [6][8][10]. Further, the implementation of PLS
in mmWave is considered a productive strategy as it can
result in higher communication speed, narrow communication
beam and shorter transmission separation [11]. Physical layer
security techniques utilize the large antenna arrays to enhance
the communication signal (via beamforming) at the target
receiver and degrade the signal quality at the eavesdropper.
Directional beamforming, however, relies on Line-of-Sight
(LoS) communication, and assumes the eavesdropper is not
along the direction of communication. In practice, the passive
eavesdropper could be located in the direction of communi-
cation, and, in the case of Non-Light-of-Sight (NLoS) com-
munication, scatters can enable the eavesdropper to intercept
the communication signal via multipath, hence rendering PHY
layer security techniques ineffective. Therefore, it is critical to
develop PHY layer security techniques that preserve privacy
in both the LoS and NLoS cases.
Several strategies have been adopted in the literature to
enhance the secrecy of mmWave wireless systems. Switched
array based schemes [8] [12]-[14] employ random antenna sub-
sets to induce artiﬁcial noise that jams potential eavesdroppers
in non-receiver directions. In addition to this, the work in [8]
proposed the use of prior information obtained from sensors
to opportunistically inject noise in potential eavesdropper
locations. In [15] and [16], low-complexity PLS techniques
based on analog cooperative beamforming are proposed. These
techniques enhanced the secrecy rate as distributed antenna
nodes result in narrower beamwidth and increased artiﬁcial
noise. The work in [17] built upon the techniques in [15] and
[16] and proposed a beamforming solution with null steering.
This solution is shown to improve the secrecy performance
when the eavesdropper is in close proximity to the target
receiver. Despite their capability in enhancing the transmission
secrecy, those techniques require a LoS link to the target
receiver and fail if the eavesdropper and the target receiver
paths overlap. For instance, path overlap can occur if the
eavesdropper is located along the transmission direction of the
receiver or it is in close proximity to the receiver. Scatters
close to the transmitter can cause blockages and lead to NLoS
links. Overlapped common channel paths (as a result of NLoS
links) between the receiver and the eavesdropper increase the
risk of information leakage to the eavesdropper. To safeguard
mmWave systems with possible overlapped common channel
paths with the eavesdropper, the work in [18]-[21] considered
the problem of aligned transmitter, eavesdropper, and target
receiver in the mainlobe path, i.e., mainlobe security. In [18], a
dual beam transmission technique that ensures the mainlobe is
coherent only at the target receiver’s location is proposed. The
work in [19] proposed a dynamic rotated angular beamforming
technique which uses a set of frequency offset modulator to

generate angle and range based transmission. The work in [21]
utilized channel knowledge of eavesdroppers to enhance the
secrecy rate of the target receiver. It should be noted that
eavesdroppers in general are passive and their presence is
unknown. The work in [20] proposed the use of maximum
ratio combining and artiﬁcial noise injection in the null space
of the receiver’s channel to safeguard transmission. Maximum
ratio combining, however, only increases the Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) at the target receiver, but does not safeguard the
communication link against an eavesdropper with a sensitive
receiver. Moreover, noise injection requires complex antenna
architectures which might be impractical to implement in
mmWave systems.
In this paper, we address the problem of overlapped com-
munication channel paths between the receiver and an arbitrary
eavesdropper and propose two transmission techniques that
enhance the security of mmWave systems with NLoS channels.
Unlike [18]-[21], the proposed techniques do not necessarily
require a LoS channel path between the transmitter and the
receiver, and can be applied using a simple analog antenna
architecture with a single RF chain at the transmitter. The ﬁrst
technique enhances secrecy by employing a path hopping tech-
nique, while the second technique uses random antenna subsets
to beamform along multiple transmission paths. The proposed
techniques facilitate secure transmission to the receiver without
the need for complex antenna architectures and reduce the
likelihood of information leakage to potential eavesdropper
with common receiver communication paths.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we introduce the system model. In Section III, we describe
the proposed PLS techniques and analyze their performance
in Section IV. We present some numerical results in Section
V and conclude the work in Section VI.

SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a mmWave system where the transmitter
communicates with a receiver via NLoS communications paths
L > 1 in the presence of an eavesdropper. The transmitter
consists of one RF chain and N antennas and the receiver
is equipped with NR antennas. To transmit the kth infor-
mation symbol s(k), where E[|s(k)|2] = 1, to the receiver,
the transmitter multiplies s(k) by unit norm transmit vector
f = [f1, f2, f3, . . . fN] ∈ CN, where fn denotes the complex
weight (or phase-shift) associated with the nth transmitting
antenna. At the receiver, the received signals on all receive
antennas are combined using a combining vector w ∈ CNR.
Assuming a narrowband block fading channel, the received
signal at the receiver is given by
y(k) = w∗Hfs(k) + z(k),
(1)
where H represents the mmWave channel matrix between the
transmitter and the receiver, and z(k) ∼ CN(0, σ2) is the
additive noise at the receiver. Adopting a geometric channel
model with L scatters, where each scatter is assumed to
contribute to a single channel path between the transmitter
and the receiver, the channel H is given by [4]
H =

where φl is Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) at the receiver associated
with the lth Angle-of-Departure (AoD) θl from the transmitter,
αl is the complex gain of the lth path and aR(φl) and aT(θl)
represent the receiver’s and transmitter’s array response deﬁned
in [4]. For ease of exposition, we assume a uniform linear array
at the transmitter and a single antenna at the receiver. Hence,
the the channel in (2) becomes

MILLIMETER WAVE SECURE TRANSMISSION
In this section, we introduce simple transmission tech-
niques suitable for mmWave systems with analog antenna
architecture (single RF chain). Nonetheless, the proposed
techniques can also be applied in systems with advanced
antenna architectures. The key idea is to exploit the intrinsic
randomness of the wireless channel to distort transmission to
eavesdroppers, with possible overlapping channels with the
receiver, without the need for a fully digital array or prior
channel information of eavesdroppers. With the assumption of
local scatters at both the transmitter and receiver, the receiver’s
channel becomes unique at the transmitter, i.e.,, function of
its location and scatters. This property has been exploited in
ﬁnger-printing and localization techniques, see example [22]-
[24] and references therein, to uniquely identify the location
of the receiver. In this paper, with the assumption of full
channel knowledge at the both the transmitter and the receiver,
we exploit this property to jam an eavesdropper with an
overlapping communication channel, i.e.,, eavesdropper shares
a communication path with the target receiver. Instead of
transmitting data symbols using the strongest channel path,
the proposed transmission techniques select a random set of
paths to transmit each data symbol (or data packet) to the target
receiver. With the assumption that the receiver knows a-priori
the selected transmission paths (this could be preprogrammed
in the system) the receiver receives coherent signal, whereas,
the eavesdropper receives a noise-like signal. This noise-like
signal, which we term artiﬁcial noise, is a result of the
randomized beam pattern observed at the eavesdropper. In the
following sections, we further elaborate on those transmission
techniques.
A. Enhancing secrecy with random path selection
In this technique, the transmitter transmits each data sym-
bol along a random path (or AoD). Speciﬁcally, let θl ∈ Φ be
the lth AoD towards the target receiver and the set Φ represents
all possible AoDs towards the target receiver. The transmitter’s
inter-antenna phase shifts are set as [13]
Υn(k) =
N − 1

− n

2π d
λ cos(θl)
(5)
where θl represents the lth selected AoD for the kth data
symbol. Based on this, the nth entry of the beamforming vector
f(k) (i.e., nth antenna weight) becomes fn(k) =
1
√N ejΥn(k).

AoDs in the set Φ, i.e., θE

deterministic with the value of N. Note this event occurs with
probability
1
L, where L is the number of paths. Hence, it is
important to have large number of paths L for this technique
to be efﬁcient.
B. Enhancing secrecy with joint path and antenna selection
The secrecy performance of the random path selection
technique deteriorates with limited number of scatters, i.e., low
number of transmit path L. To improve the secrecy in a low
scattering environment, we propose a joint antenna selection
and path selection technique. The idea is to associate a set
of M antennas for the strongest transmission path and the
remaining N−M antennas for another randomly selected path.
For each transmit symbol (or packet), different sets of antennas
are associated with the strongest path and a random secondary
transmit path. Selecting the strongest path maximizes the
receive SNR at the receiver. This dual antenna and path
selection technique results in controlled interference in both
the main and secondary transmission paths. The interference
results from the contribution of the side-lobes of each transmit
beam in all paths. The random antenna selection ensures that
the side-lobe levels are perturbed for each transmit symbol. As
the target receiver is aware of its channel, the transmit path
identity, and the set of selected antennas for each path (can
be preprogrammed a priori), it is able to decode the received
symbol. As the eavesdropper does not have knowledge of these
parameters, it can not precancel the interference due to the
perturbed side-lobes. This reduces its rate and enhances the
overall secrecy rate.
Let IM(k) be a random subset of M antennas used to
transmit the kth symbol along the strongest path (AoD θS),
and IL(k) be subset that contains the indices of the remaining
antennas used to transmit the kth symbol along a secondary
path (AoD θi). The nth antenna phase shift is set as
Υn(k) =

(15)
From (15) we observe that the noise term βE is random
since the eavesdropper is unaware of the transmit angles θi and
θs and the associated transmit antenna sets IL(k) and IM(k).
This induces artiﬁcial noise that jams the eavesdropper. We
also observe from (14) that high channel gain αE increases
the artiﬁcial noise at the eavesdropper, hence, no signiﬁcant
rate gain is expected with high channel gain.
Considering the second scenario, where we assume the
eavesdropper can only intercept the communication link via
the main lobe, the received signal at the eavesdropper along
an AoD θE = θS becomes
yE(k, θS, θi, θE) = h∗f(k)s(k) + zE(k) =

and γ(θx, θE) = 2πd
λ (cos θx − cos θE). From (17) we observe
that the noise term ˆβE consists of a constant term and a random
term (function of transmit antenna sets and AoD). Hence, to
maintain the randomness of the term ˆβE both transmit subsets
should be sufﬁciently large. This maximizes the randomness
of ˆβE and, as a result, the artiﬁcial noise at the eavesdropper.
IV.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed transmission techniques in terms of the achievable
secrecy rate R (bits/s/Hz). It is assumed that all communication
takes place during a ﬁxed coherence interval in which the
channel is assumed to known to both the transmitter and
target receiver. Furthermore, for ease of exposition, we take
a pessimistic approach and assumed that the eavesdropper is
aligned with one of the transmitter’s L paths.
The secrecy rate R is deﬁned as
R = [log2(1 + SNRR) − log2(1 + SNRE)]+,
(18)
where SNRR is the SNR at the target receiver, SNRE is the
SNR at the eavesdropper, and a+ denotes max{0, a}. In the
following, we derive the average SNR expressions for the
proposed transmission techniques.
A. Random path selection
From (6), the SNR at the receiver can be expressed as
SNRR = (E[αi
p
N/L])2
σ2
R
= N ¯α2
Lσ2
R
= NρR
L ,
(19)
where ¯α is the average channel gain of all transmit paths, and
ρR =
(E[αi])2
σ2
R
. From (19) we observe that the SNR at the
target receiver deteriorates with increasing number of paths.
This results as the total transmit power is spread among all
L paths and weaker links will be utilized for transmission.
However, as we will show in the derivation of the SNRE (see
(20)), increasing the number of paths increases the artiﬁcial
noise at the eavesdropper. Hence there is an optimal number
of paths L that enhances the secrecy rate.
Similar to (19), the SNR at an eavesdropper can be
expressed as (see (7))

(22)
The ﬁrst term of (20) captures the eavesdropper SNR when it
is aligned with one of the transmitter’s AoD, i.e., θE = θl. This
occurs with probability 1/L as it is assumed that θE overlaps
with one of the receiver’s AoDs, and there are a total of L
AoDs. The second term of (20) captures the eavesdropper SNR
when it is not aligned with the transmitter’s AoD, i.e., θE ̸= θl.
This occurs with probability 1 − 1/L. It is not difﬁcult to
observe from (20) that the eavesdropper’s SNR deteriorates
with increasing number of transmission paths.

The ﬁrst term of (25) captures the eavesdropper SNR when it

second term of (25) captures the eavesdropper SNR when it is
not aligned with the transmitter’s AoD, i.e., θE ̸= θi, θs. This
occurs with probability 1 − 2/L. It is not difﬁcult to see that
(E[ˆβE])2 < N 2 in (25), and hence the ﬁrst SNR term is lower
than the ﬁrst SNR term in (20).

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we conduct numerical simulations to eval-
uate the efﬁcacy of the proposed techniques. We consider a
setup where a transmitter is communicating with a receiver
in the presence of an eavesdropper. Both the transmitter and
receiver are unaware of the eavesdropper’s location. In this
setup, the transmitter is equipped with a uniform linear array,
with half wavelength separation, and the transmitter, receiver
and eavesdropper have perfect knowledge of their channels.
To benchmark the performance of the proposed techniques,
we compare the secrecy rate achieved by the proposed tech-
niques with the secrecy rate achieved when using conventional
transmit antenna array, i.e., no action is taken at the transmitter,
and the switched array technique proposed in [13] since it can
be applied on analog antenna architectures. For all setups, we
assume that the strongest transmit path to the target receiver
is along a ﬁxed AoD θR = 40 degrees, i.e., θR = 40 ∈ Φ,
and the remaining entries of Φ are randomly selected from
the set [1, 180] degrees. The channel gains are assumed to be
normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance. Both
the conventional array and switch antenna techniques always
transmit along AoD θR = 40 degrees. When simulating the
joint angle and antenna selection techniques, we assume that
the secondary link is selected from the set of LS = 5 strongest
paths and M = N/2.
To examine the performance of the proposed techniques,
we plot the achievable secrecy rate when using the proposed
techniques versus the eavesdropper AoD θE in Figure 1. For
all cases, we observe that the secrecy rate is higher when the
eavesdropper AoD θE does not overlap with the transmission
AoD θR = 40 degrees. However, when θE = 40 degrees, i.e.,
the eavesdropper is located along one of the transmission path
to the target receiver, we observe that all techniques suffer

a performance hit, with the conventional technique and the
switched array technique achieving zero secrecy rate for all
values of L. The proposed path selection technique is shown to
achieve higher secrecy rate for higher number of paths while
the proposed path and antenna selection technique achieves
the best performance for all cases. The reason for this is
that for low number of paths, the probability of intercepting
a direct link when using the path selection technique is
higher. This reduces the secrecy rate. The proposed path and
antenna selection technique achieves the best performance as
it randomizes both the transmit angle and antennas associated
with each angle, thereby resulting in higher artiﬁcial noise at
the eavesdropper.
In Figure 2, we examine the effect of the number of
transmit antennas on the secrecy rate. For all techniques, we
observe that increasing the number of antennas increases the
secrecy rate and the proposed techniques achieve non-zero
secrecy rates at θE = 40 degrees. This is achieved as higher
number of antennas result in narrower beams and increased
number of sidelobes. The increased number of sidelobe levels
increases the variance of the artiﬁcial noise. The path selection
technique is shown to achieve lower secrecy rate when the
eavesdropper is not located along the main transmission path
θE ̸= 40 degrees. This rate loss is experienced as the path
selection technique does not always use the best transmission
path, but rather, it transmits along a set of paths, which contain
weaker paths, to enhance the secrecy rate of the system.
To investigate the effect of the eavesdropper channel
strength on the secrecy rate, we plot the secrecy rate versus
the eavesdropper’s average channel gain to noise ratio ρE
when the eavesdropper is located along the transmitter’s AoD
θE = θR = 40 degrees in Figure 3, and when the eavesdropper
is located along the transmitters sidelobe, i.e., θE ̸= θR in
Figure 4. When the eavesdropper’s communication link is
weak, Figure 3 shows that all techniques achieve high secrecy
rate. However, when the eavesdropper channel is stronger, the
performance of both the switched-array and conventional array
techniques plummet to zero, while the performance of the path
selection technique deteriorates at a slower rate and the joint
path and antenna selection technique deteriorates at a much
slower rate as it achieves a higher artiﬁcial noise. When the
eavesdropper is not located along the transmitter’s AoD, Figure
4 shows that all techniques, except the conventional array
technique, achieve high secrecy rate. The proposed joint path
and antenna selection technique achieves the highest secrecy
rate as it randomizes both the transmit AoD and transmit
antenna sets, followed by the switched-array technique, and
the proposed path selection technique. The path selection
technique achieves a lower secrecy rate as it uses all paths
(with potentially weaker paths) for communications, while the
path and antenna selection technique always uses the strongest
path and an auxiliary path for transmission. This results in a
higher secrecy rate.

CONCLUSION
This paper addressed the problem of PLS in the presence of
an eavesdropper with overlapped channel paths with the target
receiver. Two transmission techniques suitable for mmWave
systems with analog antenna architectures are proposed. Both
techniques use random transmission paths, instead of a single

or all paths, for data transmission. This results in noise-like
signals at an arbitrary eavesdropper and improves the secrecy
of the communication system. Numerical results show that
in the presence of scatters, the proposed techniques achieve
signiﬁcantly higher secrecy rate when compared to conven-
tional and switched array techniques. Note that the proposed
techniques require the number of paths L > 1. For single
path, i.e., LoS link, passive relays can be used to increase
the number of transmission paths and induce randomness
in the communication channel. Future work would focus on
implementing a hardware prototype to investigate the efﬁcacy
of the proposed techniques.
