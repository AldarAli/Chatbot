Abstract—For Fe-rich glass-coated microwires to be a 
competitive option for magnetic technologies, the enhancing 
and tuning of their properties is necessary, and therefore, a 
better understanding of these processes is also needed. In this 
work, two Fe microwires with different geometries are 
subjected to both conventional and current annealings to study 
their effects. Results show a general enhancement of magnetic 
softness and domain wall dynamics after both treatments, also 
suggesting an earlier onset of crystallization in thin samples.

 INTRODUCTION 
Glass-Coated amorphous microwires are wires with 
radius sizes of µm, consisting of an amorphous metallic alloy 
core enveloped by a glass coating. The main interest in this 
kind of materials comes from their wide range of magnetic 
properties, 
such 
as: 
bi-stability, 
ultra-fast 
magnetic 
switching, 
magnetic 
softness 
[1] 
and 
the 
general 
modification of most of these properties under different 
situations, like the application of high temperatures and/or 
electrical currents to a microwire sample. As magnetic 
properties of these microwires are dependent on their 
chemical composition and geometric parameters, so are the 
resulting changes on them after annealing, thus the same 
process parameters may produce different results on different 
kinds of samples.  
While Fe-rich microwires properties are generally 
considered inferior (mainly lower magnetic sensitivity and 
magnetic softness) to those possessed by Co microwires, 
they represent a cheaper, more obtainable alternative [1]. 
Thus, annealing might prove to be an important asset in 
producing microwires with properties tuned to their desired 
use. As such, the main goal of this work is to measure some 
of the magnetic properties of two different types of glass-
coated microwires under the same annealing conditions, to 
obverse and better understand the resulting changes and the 
differences between them. 
Henceforth, this paper is structured as follows: Section II 
focuses on the physical techniques used to procure the 
experimental data to be studied in this paper. As such, 
Section III consists of a series of subsets, each focusing on 
the observation and study of data, each related to a relevant 
property of the microwires and their change with different 
parameters. After exposing the results, Section IV conducts a 
briefer explanation and discussion on them, and the 
conclusions that can be drawn from this work. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
In this section we introduce and describe the 
experimental procedures applied in the obtention of our 
studied data, consisting of both the fabrication technique of 
our microwires and the measurement experiments conducted 
to study their magnetic properties, as well as their most 
relevant parameters to their results. 
A. Fabrication and Parameters of the Microwires 
While 
some 
different 
fabrication 
processes 
for 
amorphous magnetic microwires may be used, we focus on 
the Taylor-Ulitovsky technique, explained in further detail in 
[2], as it allows to produce up to 103 m of a single 
microwire, while simultaneously coating it with Duran type 
glass. The importance of this glass coating comes from its 
mechanical interaction with the metallic core. As the alloy 
lacks crystalline ordering, magnetoelastic anisotropy is one 
of the main parameters to define its magnetic structure. 
Therefore, the presence of a glass coating and the stresses 
that it brings to the core strongly contribute to its magnetic 
behavior. As such, chemical composition of the core is also 
relevant, as it defines the magnetostriction constant, λ. By 
this criteria, two general compositions are usually described 
and studied: Co-rich with λ<0, and Fe-rich with λ>0 [1]. 
A notable characteristic of microwires, originated from 
their λ values and the internal stresses originated from the 
shell-core interactions, are magnetic domain structures: an 
inner and outer domain arranged in a cylindrical symmetry, 
with the inner domain presenting axial magnetic anisotropy, 
pararel to the wire’s axis for both Co and Fe based 
microwires. However, while the former’s outer domain has 
circular magnetic anisotropy, the latter’s anisotropy is radial,

usually with a proportionally thinner inner domain [1]. These 
differences in magnetic domains are related to magnetic 
properties of microwires: while Co-based microwires 
typically attract more attention, as they show higher 
magnetic softness, Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) effect 
and sensitivity to stimuli (like stress or magnetic fields), Fe 
is a more common, cheaper material, allowing for the 
production of bigger quantities of microwire for less costs, 
making it an attractive alternative for the long run [1]. 
On the other hand, treatment of microwires has shown 
observable changes of their magnetic properties, depending 
on both treatment conditions and microwire parameters [3]. 
Therefore, a correct combination of these two elements may 
be used to tune properties into the most advantageous for 
desired applications. With all of this in mind, two Fe-rich 
glass coated microwires have been fabricated and 
characterized, as shown in Table I. From these microwires, 
several 24 cm samples were then cut off, as to allow their 
proper handling for annealing and experimentation. 
B. Magnetic Characterization and Annealing 
For this work, we focus on the measurement of the 
hysteresis loop, Domain Wall (DW) velocity and GMI 
efficiency of microwire samples before and after specific 
annealing treatments. Measurements of hysteresis loops are 
carried out via a simple fluxmetric method at 114Hz, with a 
13cm long inductive coil, and 2 cm pickup and compensator 
coils. DW dynamics is studied with a modified Sixtus-Tonks 
method [4], using three pickup coils to detect the change in 
magnetic flux produced by the change in the sample 
magnetization as domain walls move through them. 
Determination of the GMI efficiency is carried out by 
using a network vector analyser, as described in [5], which 
allows measuring the impedance Z of a ~5mm sample under 
the action of both an alternate current at fixed frequencies 
and homogeneous magnetic fields. Thus, for each AC 
frequency we can evaluate the GMI ratio as a function of the 
applied magnetic field, H [6]: 
∆Z⁄Z=[Z(H)-Z(Hmax )]/Z(Hmax ) 
(1) 
Hmax being the max value of the applied magnetic field 
in the used experimental setup. Measurements were carried 
out on samples subjected to at least one of two different 
types of annealing: conventional annealing, by simply 
introducing them into a furnace at temperatures of 300, 400 
and 500 ºC, for 1 and 3 hours; and current annealing, by 
making a direct current pass through them. Current 
intensities and annealing times presented in this work were 
chosen as it had been previously observed that they produce 
the most noticeable changes in these microwires [7]. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Having 
produced 
our 
microwire 
samples 
and 
experimented on their magnetic behavior, we now proceed to 
study the obtained data on their magnetic hysteresis, domain 
wall dynamics and giant magneto-impedance effect, 
comparing the results depending on measurement and 
annealing conditions, as to ascertain the effect of said 
conditions and their possible combination to tune the 
microwire’s properties for desired applications. 
A. Magnetic Hysteresis 
Some examples of the measured loops are presented in 
Figure 1. As usual for Fe based microwires with positive λ 
(~10-6), their shapes are fairly rectangular, with a single 
Barkhausen jump and magnetic bi-stability [8]. It can be seen 
that, the thicker the sample, the bigger its coercive field, HC. 
It is also worth noting that the effect of current annealing 
seems to be greater on both samples, as it brings HC to lower 
values. 
To better compare the effects of annealing, Figure 2 
shows the measured HC obtained for all realized treatments, 
except for the “Thin” wire annealed with 500ºC. It is obvious 
that for “Thick” samples, the higher the annealing 
temperature, the bigger its reduction of HC as a result of the 
relaxation of their inner stresses. Opposite to this, “Thin” 
samples show a raise after long enough annealing times, as 
their higher surface to volume ratio allow for higher thermal 
energy densities, and thus, for an earlier onset of the alloy’s 
crystallization. On the other hand, current annealing of all 
samples shows a consistent reduction of HC, even for long 
annealing times. 
The reason for excluding “Thin” samples annealed with 
500ºC is that they exhibited rather different results, as can be 
seen in Figure 3. Annealing at high temperatures of “Thin” 
samples resulted on an observable magnetic hardening, most 
likely as a result of crystallization of the metallic core [1].

Figure 2.  HC dependece on annealing times. The “+” indicates the 
application of current annealing after conventional annealing. 
Additionally, as the inset in Figure 3 shows, a small 
metastable transition between two Barkhausen jumps is 
taking place at around 0 magnetization, which could be 
hinting at the presence of two distinct crystalline phases in 
the metallic core upon its devitrification, with the 
magnetization of one phase beginning shortly after the other 
one is completely done. Furthermore, current annealing of 
these samples may be resulting in a change in the proportion 
of said crystalline phases, as the position of this metastable 
step is modified upon the application of current. 
B. Domain Wall Dynamics 
After measuring DW velocities of all samples under applied 
field, a consistent pattern, briefly represented in Figure 4, 
was observed. Firstly, “Thin” microwires possess higher DW 
mobility (slope of the field dependence of DW velocity [4]), 
than “Thick” ones, reaching higher DW velocities for the 
same applied field. Conventional annealing of both types of 
samples yields a boost on DW mobility, especially on the 
“Thin” ones.

different times and with posterior current annealing. 
 
Figure 4.  DW velocities of samples after annealing. 
DW velocities of “Thin” samples annealed at 500º could 
not be measured, most probably due to their magnetic 
hardening, as shown in Figure 3, which would make them 
require a higher magnetic field than those produced by our 
system for their DW to star propagating. Secondly, current 
annealing results on different effects depending on the 
sample and previous annealing: while current alone produces 
a slight increase of DW mobility of “Thick” microwires, 
“Thin” ones experience an observable reduction. However, 
current annealing after conventional annealing seems to have 
opposite effects, as “Thick” samples seem unaffected while 
the boost on mobility of “Thin” ones grows even bigger. 
C. Giant Magneto-Impedance 
The GMI ratio of all samples was measured for 
frequencies up to 1 GHz. A short, representative example is 
shown in Figure 5. This figure carries some interesting 
information points about the magnetic domain structure of 
our microwires, as well as about their behavior under the 
action of annealing and their contribution to the GMI effect 
efficiency. First, both type of microwires exhibit a double

peak structure in their GMI graphs, a phenomenon usually 
related to the magnetic domain structure of Co-rich 
microwires. This is congruent with previous results obtained 
by our own research [7]. However, when “Thick” samples 
are annealed at high enough temperatures, this double peak is 
lost at lower frequencies, appearing as the single peak 
expected in Fe-rich microwires. The most probable cause for 
this is the relaxation of internal stresses in the microwire, 
causing a reduction in size of the outer domain and, 
therefore, its contribution to the GMI effect. 
Secondly, while as-cast “Thick” samples show a GMI 
max ratio (100%) quite higher than that of “Thin” ones 
(50%), and annealing of both microwires results in an 
enhancement of their ratios, the growth of “Thin” GMI (from 
50% to 100%) is proportionally bigger than that observed in 
“Thick” ones (from 100% to less than 160%).  
To better understand how annealing affects each 
microwire, Figure 6 and Figure 7 represent the max values of 
GMI ratios of annealed “Thick” and “Thins” samples 
respectively. When comparing both graphs, it becomes 
obvious that thicker microwires yield a higher GMI 
performance, as the highest ratios produced by annealed 
“Thin” samples does not surpass those of the “Thick” as cast 
sample. While it can be seen that annealing has indeed 
provided an enhancement on GMI ratios of both microwires, 
a closer look on both graphs reveals behaviors that are more 
complex. In Figure 6, conventional annealing at 300ºC 
results in the highest GMI values of the sample at both 1 and 
3 hours, while annealing at 500ºC lowers said values back to 
a level similar to that of the as cast state. The addition of 
current annealing after these processes yields a negative 
effect in most cases, as the GMI ratios values become lower, 
with the exception of the annealing with 500ºC for 1 hour, 
which results in an enhancement comparable to those 
obtained at 300ºC.

IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
While thinner microwires possess better magnetic 
softness due to lower HC values, they also show a lower 
resistance to heat as, under the same annealing conditions, 
there are hints of alloy crystallization, not present on thicker 
ones. Current annealing may prove to be a decent alternative 
to heat annealing as, with only some minutes of treatment, 
the reduction of HC is bigger than annealing under 400ºC for 
3h (Figure 2). Combination of both annealings has yielded a 
further reduction of these values, especially in thicker 
microwires. Opposite to these trends, DW dynamics show 
that annealing barely affects thick microwires, while thin 
ones can be subjected to either a boost or reduction of their 
DW velocities. 
Conventional annealing of both types of microwires at 
300ºC for 1 hour has shown to yield the highest values of 
GMI ratios, while de addition of current annealing after this 
process is mostly detrimental, except for specific cases in 
which said values are once again enhanced after their 
lowering due to excessive annealing temperatures or times. 
This might prove to be an interesting option to “repair” the 
sensitivity of microwires used in magnetic sensing 
technologies at high temperatures.
