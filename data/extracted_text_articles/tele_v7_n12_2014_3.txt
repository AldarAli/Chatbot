Abstract—To increase the throughput of transmission systems,
MIMO-OFDM
technology
enables
better
transmission
rate
and improves the reception. The synchronization between the
transmitter and the receiver has become a big challenge. A bad
timing synchronization causes the loss of a lot of information
in a MIMO-OFDM system. In this paper, a novel timing
synchronization
method
is
proposed
for
a
MIMO-OFDM
systems with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas.
The proposed method is based on transmit an orthogonal
CAZAC
sequences
over
different
transmit
antennas
[1].
Simulations results show that the proposed solution presents
a good performance at a low SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in
AWGN and multipath fading Rayleigh channels, where Doppler
Effect is not considered for current simulations. Furthermore,
this method can be implemented for MIMO-OFDM system up
to 8 × 8 as well. In the proposed method, the coarse and ﬁne
timing synchronization are done at the same time at each receive
antenna due to the different training sequences transmitted over
different transmit antennas.
Keywords - MIMO-OFDM system, timing synchronization,

I. INTRODUCTION
The
world
of
wireless
communications
and
mobile
communication is currently at a very important crossroads
in
its
evolution.
This
crossroads
introduces
a
variety
of challenges such as multi-path signal reﬂections, and
interference. These can reduce the performance of a receiver.
To address these challenges, OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing) modulation combined with MIMO
(Multiple Input-Multiple Output) is proposed in 802.11n [2].
The OFDM [3] divides a frequency bandwidth into several
(Nsc) orthogonal sub-carrier. To simply achieve orthogonal
frequency
multiplex,
Saltzberg
and
Weinstein
[4]
have
shown that the use of the FFT algorithm (Fast Fourier
Transform) can easily produce the OFDM symbol carried
by Nsc orthogonal subcarriers. The IFFT (Inverse Fast
Fourier Transform) algorithm is also used to demodulate the
message at the receiver. To maintain the orthogonality, the
sub-carrier spacing required is ∆f =
1
Ts , where Ts is the
duration of OFDM symbol. Due to this orthogonality, OFDM
is more resistant to frequency selective fading than FDM
(Frequency Division Multiplexing) systems. The orthogonality
of frequencies is primordial to eliminate the ICI (Inter Carrier
Interference). On the other hand, it should be noted that the
most important disadvantage of OFDM is probably the PAPR
(Peak-to-Average Power Ratio), leading to replacing it on the
up-link in LTE (Long-Term Evolution).
Otherwise, to reduce the ISI (Inter Symbol Interference)
due to the multipath fading channel, OFDM technology uses
a technique that consists to insert a GI (Guard Interval) [5] or
CP (Cyclic Preﬁx) of duration Tg. The duration of CP should
be greater than or equal to the maximum spread of the channel
impulse response τmax. The CP is usually a copy of the last
portion of an OFDM symbol. Therefore, the useful part Ts
of each OFDM symbol will no longer be affected by the
ISI. The total duration of the OFDM symbol is Ttot = Ts+Tg.
Furthermore, MIMO is a wireless technology that uses
multiple transmit antennas (Nt) and multiple receive antennas
(Nr) to transmit data at the same time. Several applications,
based on MIMO technology, have been proposed in various
communication standards as WiFi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax
(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), HSPA+
(evolved High-Speed Packet Access), 3rd and 4th generation
of mobile network and LTE. MIMO is based on two main
techniques [6], [7]: Spatial Multiplexing techniques (SM) and
Spatial Diversity techniques (SD).
1) Spatial Multiplexing technique (SM): The spatial mul-
tiplexing technique transmits independent data streams,
over different antennas, in order to increase the transmis-
sion data rates in a given frequency bandwidth. MIMO
systems are mainly used to increase the ﬂow of wireless
communications. Foshini et al. [8] and Telatar [9] have
shown that the theoretical capacity of the MIMO channel,
with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas, in-
creases linearly with min(Nt, Nr). The channel capacity
of a MIMO system is deﬁned by the equation (1) [8], [9]:

• ρ =

No.B: Signal to noise ratio (SNR).
• P

• N0 : Power Spectral Density (PSD).
2) Spatial
Diversity
technique
(SD):
Spatial
diversity
technique consists of sending the same data stream
simultaneously on different transmit antennas. At the
receiver, several versions of the signal are received and
combined on each of the antennas. This combination
reduces the attenuation of the signal and compensates
the effect of fading channels. This diversity requires to
make use of STC (Space-Time Codes) such as Alamouti
codes [10] or trellis codes [11]. Spatial diversity has good
efﬁciency when the MIMO sub-channels are decorrelated
to each other. Furthermore, when the number of transmit
antennas increases, the power of the received signal
increases, thereby improving the detection of received
signal.
In this paper, we will focus on spatial diversity technique
using STBC (Space-Time Block Code) with Alamouti [10]
encoder.
One of the main challenges for MIMO-OFDM system is
the synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Two
types of synchronization are necessary, the frequency and
the timing synchronization. The frequency synchronization
is based on the detection of the frequency offset between
the transmitter and the local oscillator at the receiver [12].
The CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) is presented due to
the Doppler effect or the difference between the frequency
between transmitter and receiver in MIMO-OFDM systems.
In the other hand, timing synchronization is divided into two
parts: the coarse timing synchronization detects the arrival
of the OFDM frame and the ﬁne timing synchronization
is needed to detect the beginning of OFDM symbols on
each frame. The timing synchronization is very important
on each communication system and it is important to have
a robust algorithm to estimate the timing synchronization in
order to detect the start of each OFDM frame and symbol.
In this paper, we focus on the timing synchronization in
MIMO-OFDM systems.
In the literature, several synchronization approaches have
been proposed for OFDM and MIMO-OFDM systems [13]–
[17]. The main idea is the use of good synchronization
preamble, at the transmitter, in order to detect the packet
arrival, at the receiver.
In this paper, we propose a novel preamble structure
for
timing
synchronization
in
MIMO-OFDM
systems
using CAZAC (Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation)
sequences. The CAZAC sequences [18] are a class of
complex-valued sequences with cyclic autocorrelation equal
to zero. The main characteristics of CAZAC sequences
are their zero auto-aorrelation; it means that a CAZAC
code is always orthogonal with its cyclic shifted versions.
Furthermore, they have a constant amplitude. The main
beneﬁts of CAZAC sequences are the reduction of ISI and
they avoid interferences between multiple antennas. As a
result, CAZAC sequences are regarded as preamble for timing
synchronization in MIMO-OFDM systems.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy de-
scribes the MIMO-OFDM system structure based on STBC
code. Related work are presented in Section III. Section IV
introduces the criteria to select a good synchronization se-
quences. The proposed method and preamble structure are
presented in Section V. Simulation results and conclusion are
given in Sections VI and VII, respectively.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Like any telecommunications system, MIMO-OFDM sys-
tem consists of a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver. The
transmitter generates OFDM symbols which are modulated
using QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). The OFDM
symbols are transmitted over multiple antennas using space
time coding block (STBC) [10], [19]. The STBC is a technique
to transmit multiple copies of a data stream across Nt transmit
antennas in a MIMO system. It exploits the spatial diversity
and increases the reliability of transmission. This type of code
is divided into three main approaches [19]: OSTBC (Orthog-
onal Space-Time Block Codes), NOSTBC (Non-Orthogonal
Space-Time Block Codes) and QSTBC (Quasi-Orthogonal
Space-Time Block Codes). Our approach is based on the
STBC using Alamouti code [10].
A. MIMO-OFDM System
Figure 1 presents a MIMO-OFDM system with Nt transmit
antennas, Nr
receive antennas and Nsc subcarriers per
transmit antenna. The data block is used in order to generate
the bitstream, then a serial/parallel (S-to-P) converter is
used to distribute the datastream to the QAM modulator
(Sub carrier mapping). This modulator maps the bit stream
according to the 32-QAM modulation. The QAM symbols
are then introduced into a STBC encoder. Then, we apply the
IFFT to generate the OFDM symbols. A cyclic preﬁx block
(Add CP) consist to insert a guard interval between successive
OFDM symbols, which the last TG seconds of each symbol
is appended to the beginning of each OFDM symbol. The CP
is used in order to minimize the ISI and it will be removed
at the receiver before to the FFT. The synchronization block
is used in order to insert the synchronization preamble at the
beginning of each OFDM frame. Two different approaches
are presented, the synchronization preamble is appended in
frequency domain or in time domain. In this paper, we focus
on the ﬁrst approach. In [20], we proposed another method
that generates the synchronization preamble in time domain.

The ﬁrst block after the analog to digital converter (ADC) is
the timing synchronization block. After a good timing synchro-
nization, the cyclic preﬁx of each OFDM symbol is eliminated.
The signal returns back into frequency domain thanks to
FFT block. The equalization is used in order to ﬁght the ISI
problem, which is created by multipath fading channels, taking
into account the channel estimation coefﬁcients. The estimated
symbols are decoded and combined by the STBC decoder.
Then, a QAM demodulator is used to demodulate and recover
the binary information. The parallel/serial (P-to-S) converter
allows to reformatting the binary bit stream.

III. RELATED WORK
In the literature, several synchronization approaches have
been proposed for OFDM and MIMO-OFDM as shown in
Section I. The most of the synchronization methods are
preamble based.
Authors in [21] provides a method for timing and frequency
synchronization for a MIMO-OFDM system using the LS
(Loosely Synchronous) codes to detect the beginning of each
received frame. LS codes have a good autocorrelation and
cross-correlation functions within certain vicinity of the zero
shifts. In this method, the synchronization process is divided
into four steps. The ﬁrst step is to estimate the coarse timing
synchronization and, the second step is to estimate the coarse
frequency synchronization. The third step detects the OFDM
symbols and estimates the channel using the LS codes, the
fourth step is for the ﬁne frequency estimation. Furthermore,
the structure of preambles used in the process is relatively
complex.
Authors
in
[22]
proposed
a
timing
synchronization
method based on OVSF (Orthogonal Variable Spreading
Factor). Simulations results are done using MISO (Multiple
Input-Single Output) systems 2 × 1. The length of each
OFDM symbol is 256, and the length of the CP is 32. A
synchronization preamble is appended at the beginning of
each OFDM frame, this preamble has the same length as the
CP. For MISO-OFDM systems 2 × 1, the timing acquisition
probability is 1 for SNR ≥ −5 dB. The synchronization
preamble for this method is appended in the time domain,
this is the main drawback of this method. With such
implementation, authors need an extra block to insert the
preamble, while, in frequency domain we do not need any
extra block thanks to IFFT.
Based on our proposed approach, a compact preamble
design for synchronization in distributed MIMO-OFDM
systems has been proposed in [23]. The authors have
designed training symbols based on exclusive subband,
where different adjacent subbands are spaced by guard
bands to reduce their mutual interference. In
[23], authors
propose a compact preamble structure that has the same
length as an OFDM symbol. This preamble, based on
CAZAC sequences, is carried by a different subbands. The
simulation results shown that for a MISO-OFDM (3 × 1), the
acquisition probability for timing synchronization is 70% for
an SNR = 5 dB. In this work, we compare the simulation
results of our proposed [1] with those of the method proposed
by Chin-Liang et al [23].
The proposed method in [23] has several limitations such
as the complexity of the structures to generate the synchro-
nization preambles for a large number of transmit antennas.
In [23], when the number of transmit antennas increases, the
size of sub-bands should be reduced to take into account all
transmit antennas. Therefore, at the receiver, the probability of
synchronization decreases due to the length of synchronization
sequence.
IV. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR SYNCHRONIZATION
SEQUENCES
Most of timing synchronization methods are based on
preamble approach. They consist in sending a synchronization
preamble at the beginning of each OFDM frame. The main
characteristic of synchronization preamble is to have good
autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties in order to
detect a correlation peak as closed as possible to a Dirac pulse.
On the other hand, the synchronization preambles should be
orthogonal to eliminate the interferences between preambles
at simultaneous transmissions in MIMO systems. The main
sequences used in the state of art are listed below.
A. Gold sequences
Gold sequences have been proposed by Robert Gold in
1967 [24]. These sequences are constructed by two PN (Pseu-
dorandom Noise) sequences of the same length. The XOR (⊕)
is the operation to generate Gold sequences. Let x and y be
two PN maximum length sequences of the length LC = 2l−1.
The set Sgold(x, y) of Gold sequences is given by:
Sgold(x, y) = {x, y, x ⊕ y, x ⊕ T −1y, . . . , x ⊕ T −(LC−1)y}
(7)
where T −p is an operator of cyclic shifts of p values to the
left.
The cross-correlation peak of some periodic Gold sequences
take one of the three possible values −1, −t(l) or t(l) − 2,
where t(l) is given by:
t(l) =
 2(l+2)/2 + 1
if l is even
2(l+1)/2 + 1
if l is odd
(8)
The disadvantage of Gold sequences is inter-code interfer-
ence due to high cross-correlation. In this paper, the syn-
chronization preamble is appended at the beginning of each
OFDM frame and is transmitted aperiodic. Therefore, the
autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of aperiodic
Gold sequences are shown in Figure 2 where index represents
indices at which the correlation was estimated.
B. Walsh-Hadamard code
Walsh-Hadamard code are built recursively from a 2 × 2
Hadamard’s matrix [25]. These codes are orthogonal and
bipolar, where the Hadamard’s matrix is given by:

functions of Hadamard sequences are shown in Figure 3.
C. CAZAC sequences
The CAZAC (Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation)
sequences [26] are a class of complex-valued sequences with
cyclic autocorrelation equal to zero. CAZAC sequences are
characterized by their constant amplitude and their correlation
function. The cross-correlation function between two different
CAZAC sequences is near to zero and the autocorrelation
function is as δ. Let xu(k) be a CAZAC sequence of length
LC, xu(k) is given in equation (10):

D. Selection criteria
Both Gold and Hadamard sequences have good correlation
functions, but Gold sequences have a high value for their cross-
correlation function, while for some Hadamard sequences, the
autocorrelation function has secondary correlation peaks. In
the other hand, and as shown in Figure 4, CAZAC sequences
have a good autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions.
In this paper, our work was focused on the use of CAZAC
sequence as synchronization sequences in the synchronization
preamble with different structures.
V. PROPOSED METHOD FOR TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION
In this section, we present our timing synchronization
method based on CAZAC sequences. We deﬁne, in this
section, C as a CAZAC sequence of length LC, where:
LC = LF F T /2
(12)
LF F T is the size of the FFT and −C∗ is the minus
conjugate of C of length LC. This approach is based into
two structures.
A. First preamble structure
The proposed timing synchronization structure, in this
section, relies on sending a preamble structure performed in
the frequency domain, as shown in Figure 5.

Fig. 5: General preamble structure in frequency domain for
the ﬁrst structure
In Figure 5, each preamble contains a CAZAC (C) sequence
mapped on the odd subcarrier, in frequency domain, and
the −C∗ is mapped on the even subcarrier. Let Xi
u(k) be
the preamble that appended at the beginning of each OFDM
frame in frequency domain on the ith transmit antenna. This
preamble can be given by the following equation:
Xi

where k ∈ {0, LF F T − 1} and LF F T = 2.LC.
Figure 6 presents the real and the imaginary parts of the
synchronization preamble in time domain. The combination
of a CAZAC sequence C with −C∗ gives a time-domain
complex envelope form that have a good autocorrelation
and cross-correlation functions. This combination does not
destroy the orthogonality between subcarriers, and it retains
Fig. 6: Real and imaginary parts of the ﬁrst preamble structure
in time domain
the orthogonality between different preambles over different
transmit antennas.
Figure 7 presents the autocorrelation and the cross-
correlation of the proposed preamble in time domain. This
preamble shows a good correlation function in order to detect
the timing synchronization peak.
Figure 8 represents different CAZAC sequences transmitted
over different transmit antennas. The term Ci
k is the sample
of the CAZAC sequence carried by the kth subcarrier and
transmitted by the transmitting antenna Ti. The proposed
method can be applied regardless of the number of transmit
or receive antennas.

VI. SIMULATIONS RESULTS
The simulations have been done, in both AWGN channel
and multipaths fading channel, to evaluate the performance of
our proposed preamble against previous proposed preamble.
A. Simulation parameters
A SISO-OFDM (Single Input-Single Output) and MIMO-
OFDM systems up to 8 × 8 transmit and receive antennas
were simulated. An OFDM system with 512 and 1024 sub-
carriers (LF F T = 512, LF F T = 1024 resp.) was considered
in Rayleigh multipath fading channel with 6 paths sample-
spaced with Ts (Sampling Time), suggested by the IEEE
802.11 Working Group [28]. The simulation parameters are
summarized in the following Tables I and II.

B. Timing synchronization
In order to detect the timing synchronization peak, a correla-
tion function Rrj,seqj between the received signal rj [equation
(5)] and the local sequence seqj at the receive antenna Rj is
applied in time domain. Due to the distribution of CAZAC se-
quence C and −C∗ in each preamble, the correlation between
received signal and the local sequence may give a high peak’s
value. The correlation function is calculated as:
Rrj,seqj(n) =
L
X
n=1
[rj(n) ∗ seqj(n − τ)]
(15)
where n is the index of the sample.
By correlating the received signal rj with a local sequence
seqj at each receive antenna Rj, a timing synchronization
estimate ( ˆ
indn) is given by:
ˆ
indn = argmax
n
{∥Rrj,seqj(n)∥}
(16)
The
ˆ
indn is the timing estimate where n is considered as
the coarse timing synchronization point. By shifting the FFT

window, we can ﬁnd the ﬁne timing synchronization or the
beginning of the OFDM symbols on each frame.
C. Simulation results for the ﬁrst preamble structure
The ﬁrst preamble structure, presented in Section V, were
simulated using the simulation parameters in Tables I and II.
The probability of successful timing frame synchronization
PSY NC is evaluated in Figures 11 and 12. They show
the acquisition probability for different OFDM systems
(SISO-OFDM, MIMO-OFDM up to 8 × 8), using CAZAC
sequences. The lengths of preamble are 1024 and 512,
respectively (LF F T = 1024, LF F T = 512 resp.).
Figure
11
shows
that
the
system
has
achieved
a
synchronization probability over 95% at an SNR = −5dB
for both SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM 2 × 2 systems.
For a MIMO-OFDM 4 × 4 system the PSY NC > 97% at an
SNR = 0 dB. On the other hand, for MIMO-OFDM 8 × 8
system, the acquisition probability PSY NC reaches 90% at
an SNR = 0 dB.
In Figure 12 and for LF F T = 512, it should be mentioned
that the acquisition probability PSY NC is greater than 99%
for both SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM 2 × 2 systems at
an SNR = −5 dB, and PSY NC > 90% for MIMO-OFDM
4 × 4 system at an SNR = 0 dB. For MIMO-OFDM 8 × 8
system the PSY NC reaches 80% at an SNR = 3 dB.
For MIMO-OFDM systems, the limitations of all timing
synchronization methods, are the number of transmit antennas
and the length of the synchronization preamble.

The simulation results of our proposed method (Figure 11)
shows a good performance in terms of timing synchronization
acquisition probability for MIMO-OFDM system up to 8 × 8,
with a preamble length equal to 1024. A degradation of
performances in term of PSY NC (Figure 12) is observed
when the length of preamble is smaller than the length
used in Figure 11. The degradations of PSY NC, for a large
number of transmit antennas, are due to the length of the
synchronization preamble. Otherwise, at the receiver, as the
length of the preamble is longer then the probability of timing
synchronization is higher.
In Figure 13, we compared the performance between our
proposed approach and the synchronization scheme in [23].
Based on simulation parameters presented in Tables
I and
II, our proposed method has a good performance against
those obtained by [23]. Furthermore, this ﬁgure shows that
the acquisition probability PSY NC of our proposed method is
greater than 90% for a SNR > 3 dB for both MIMO-OFDM
2 × 2 and 3 × 3 systems, while the method proposed in [23],
shows that the acquisition probability is between 50% and
75% for a SNR > 3 dB. On the other hand, and for
both MIMO-OFDM 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 systems, our method
presents a perfect timing synchronization for a SNR > 10 dB.
D. Simulation results for the second preamble structure
This section presents the simulation results for the second
preamble structure presented in Section V. This simulation
are performed using the simulation parameters in Tables I
and II.

The timing acquisition probability PSY NC for different
size of FFT (LFFT = 1024 and LFFT = 512) is shown in
Figures 14 and 15, respectively.
Figure 14 shows that for a LF F T
=
1024 and a
SNR
≥
−5 dB, the acquisition probability PSY NC is
greater than 95% for both SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM
2 × 2 systems. Otherwise, the synchronization probability
is perfect from a SNR ≥ 5 dB for the sam systems. On
the other hand, for a MIMO-OFDM 4 × 4 system the
PSY NC is greater than 96% for a SNR ≥ 0 dB, and its
equal to 1 for a SNR ≥ 15 dB. Therefore, the acquisition
probability for MIMO-OFDM 8 × 8 system, reaches 90% for
an SNR > 2 dB.
In Figure 15, the simulation results are performed with
an LF F T
= 512. This ﬁgure shows that the acquisition
probability PSY NC is greater than 99% for both SISO-
OFDM and MIMO-OFDM 2×2 systems at an SNR = 0 dB,
and PSY NC > 90% for MIMO-OFDM 4 × 4 system at an
SNR = 0 dB. For MIMO-OFDM 8 × 8 system the PSY NC
reaches 90% at an SNR = 13 dB.
Other simulations are performed to compare our second
proposed approach with the method proposed in [23], using
the same simulation parameters of Tables I and II. Results are
shown in Figure 16. In this ﬁgure, the size of the preamble
is LF F T = 256. As shown in this ﬁgure, the timing synchro-
nization acquisition probability for our proposed approach is
better than the proposed method in [23].

In this section, we present a comparaison between our

them. In the Figure 17, we obtained acquisition probability
of our proposed approaches for MIMO-OFDM system 4 × 4,
and using the simulation parameters of Tables I and II.

The two approaches present a good timing synchronization
acquisition probability at a low SNR. On the other hand,
the acquisition probability of the ﬁrst approach is perfect for
an SNR ≥ 10 dB, while its equal to 99% for the second
approach for the same SNR. Therefore, the ﬁrst approach
presents a high performances versus the second approach. This
performance is due to the good correlation function of the
synchronization preamble.
VII. CONCLUSION
One of the main challenges in a MIMO-OFDM system
is the detection of the beginning of the received OFDM
frames, this step called timing synchronization. The most of
the timing synchronization methods are preamble based. In
this paper, we proposed a novel compact preamble structure,
in order to detect the timing frame synchronization. This
structure is divided into two approaches. At the transmitter,
a synchronization preamble is appended at the beginning
of each OFDM frame. This preamble is based on CAZAC
sequences, where those sequences have a good autocorrelation
and cross-correlation functions.
At the receiver, and due to this combination, the correlation
function between received signal and a local sequence
shows a good frame detection with a large number of
transmit antennas up to 8 × 8. In comparison to the subband
preamble based proposed by [23], our timing synchronization
approaches present a better timing frame synchronization
at a low SNR. Finally, we present the performance of
our approaches, we ﬁnd a few degradation of performance
between our two approaches due to the correlation functions
of different preambles structure. Our approaches can be
implemented in MIMO-OFDM systems, with a large number
of transmit antennas.
Even though there is still a large number of open research
problems in the area of MIMO-OFDM systems. The proposed
methods in this paper are presented for timing synchronization
for such systems. Hence, it will be interesting to see the
performance of our approach for frequency synchronization.
Future work will assess, also, the performance of our approach
in other communications systems.
