 INTRODUCTION 
In South Korea, several wireless communication schemes, 
i.e., Very High Frequency (VHF), Trunked Radio System-
ASTRO (TRS-ASTRO), and TRS-TETRA, are applied in 
railway communication systems depending on the region. 
Therefore, several mobile terminals are equipped with one 
train to support various communication schemes which may 
not guarantee seamless communication environments. 
Furthermore, the maximum data transmission requirements 
are different depending on communication scheme which 
makes it difficult to transmit a certain data. To overcome 
these limitations and support seamless communication 
environments and deliver high data rate transmission, Long 
Term Evolution (LTE) based wireless communication 
systems have been developed. Recently, LTE scheme is 
considered as next generation of railway communication 
scheme [1][2]. Some performance results of LTE based 
railway communication systems are introduced in [3][4]. 
However, experimental measurement results adopting LTE 
based 
communication 
system 
in 
practical 
railway 
environments are not thoroughly introduced. In this paper, 
we introduce the experimental test results of LTE based 
railway wireless communication systems.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
 In this section, we consider system architecture. Fig. 1 
represents the overall system architecture. In general, the 
system consists of Evolved Packet Core (EPC), Digital Unit 
(DU) and Remote Radio Unit (RRU).

Figure 1.  The overall system architecture. 
EPC follows the 3GPP LTE standard structure. However, 
different from the general LTE networks, EPC and DU have 
dual system for emergency scenarios. RRU has also a dual 
system, which enables to transmit signal proper when the 
adjacent RRU is inactive status. Since railway network is 
directly related to the safety of passengers, the main part of 
system consists of dual systems. The train is equipped with 
mobile terminal and on board unit for communication. With 
this architecture, the performance of wireless communication 
is measured in two scenarios: one is open area and the other 
is tunnel area. Then, the Reference Signal Received Power 
(RSRP), communication coverage, call setup time, handover 
success rate, data delay time, and successive packet loss rate 
are measured. The average moving speed of train is 250km/h. 
The 
frequency 
band 
for 
uplink 
and 
downlink 
is 
718~728MHz and 773~783MHz, respectively.  Therefore, 
each link has 10MHz of bandwidth.

MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
For experimental measurement, we transmit signal 
approximately with 46dBm at the end of User Equipment 
(UE) based on 3GPP standard in [5]. 
A. RSRP and communication coverage 
The reference RSRP value is measured based on 3GPP 
standard, and the reference criterion is greater than or equal -
110dBm. We regard RSRP as “success” if the RSRP satisfies

85% of reference value, i.e., -110dBm.  Table I and Table II 
represent measurement results of RSRP. As we can see, if 
the distance between RRU and RRU is greater than 3Km, the 
RSRP is not sufficient.

B. Call setup time 
For call setup time we measured call setup time for 
emergency call, Push to Talk (PTT) call setup time, and 
group call setup time. We also measured call success rate for 
each case. Table III shows reference value and its 
corresponding measured value. The table indicates that all 
cases represent successful results

C. Handover success rate 
We measured handover success rate with the same 
condition of RSRU measurement condition. The criterion for 
successful handover rate is greater than 99%. Tables IV and 
V show that all cases fulfill the handover success rate.  
D. Data delay time 
Data delay time is measured to test the buffering time 
which is caused by several signal flow steps. The successful 
delay time is less than 600ms, where the measured average 
delay time is 28ms. Therefore, the measured data satisfies 
the data delay time criterion.

E. Successive packe loss rate 
Successive packet loss rate measures the loss rate when 
the long data packet rate (6000bytes) signal is transmitted. 
The measurement results show that there is no loss although 
long packet is transmitted.
