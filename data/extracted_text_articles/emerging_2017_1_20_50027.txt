Abstract— This study presents a science simulation
game, and evaluates in great depth its impact on
education
operation
management.
The
suggested
simulation was empirically examined by investigating the
nature
and
composition
of
its
framework.
The
descriptive quantitative methodology was appointed to
answer the research questions. Data was collected from
308 student participants in both Cycles One and Two,
along with their parents, learning support assistants, and
teachers. The findings revealed that the students who
played the game experienced a deeper level of learning
by the action of intrinsic motivation. Furthermore,
simple decision-making skills could be acquired with
traditional teaching methods, but simulation games were
more effective when students had to develop decision-
making abilities for managing complex and dynamic
situations.
Keywords-simulations;

environment; intrinsic motivation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The recent generation of private school students is
experiencing the world with their personal computers (PCs).
Many have invested much energy playing computer games
and are presently highly skilled at learning and applying
complex arrangements of standards through game playing.
Proserpio and Gioia claimed that the pedagogical method of
the new virtual generation varies from the previously used
methods. It is significantly more visual, intelligent, and
concentrated on critical thinking [1]. While this could be
viewed as a danger to the traditional learning methods, it
could likewise be viewed as a chance to develop simulation
games that empower the learning of management practices
and standards.
Creators
utilize
diverse
wordings
to
characterize
simulation technologies that range from top administration,
to pilot test programs, to business test systems, to simulation
games, to large and small scale universes, to learning
research facilities [2].
Simulations and games are broadly
utilized in different domains of educational courses. The
utilization of simulation and games relies to a great extent on
educator’s personal capabilities, learning goal and familiarity
with the courses instead of their basic knowledge. The
confusion between simulations and games has been available
from the time that simulation was invented [3]. Since game
based learning is becoming more important in teaching, there
is a need to verify the utilization of simulation and games.
Despite the fact that there have been numerous endeavors
at elucidation, it is still essential to stress the contrasts
between the two concepts and to characterize a simulation
game. Webster characterizes a simulation as "the illustration
of the action or qualities of one framework using another
framework, esp. utilizing a PC". strictly speaking; simulation
involves the description of a part of reality in view of an
improved, and reflective model.
Game is any challenge (play) among players working
under imperatives (rules) for a goal, winning, triumph or
payoff is a game [4]. Game is along these lines a chance to
utilize
one's
aptitudes
and
contend
with
others.
The
nomenclature
additionally
proposes
a
simulation
and
pleasant action, despite the fact that in academic setting
diversions ought not to be utilized chiefly for entertainment.
In reality, Abt (1970) alludes to educational games as
"significant games." A game is not inevitably a simulation
[5].
Simulations, interactive techniques, allow students to
practice something that is not quite the same as what they are
familiar with [6]. This new experience can prompt more
noteworthy appreciation of the content as well. Upon
teaching operation management, simulation games embrace
a problem-based learning method [7][8]. The problem-based
learning method requires educators to introduce students to
real-world operation problems that demand to be evaluated
and solved.
This paper is organized into five sections as follows:
Section two contains a historical view of simulation. Section
three
portrays
a
literature
review of the
pedagogical
simulation, through describing the type of simulation used in
the study, and effectiveness along intrinsic motivation level.
The fourth section investigates the research method upon
discussing the data collection, measurements, findings, and
analysis of data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion

of the limitation of the research and next steps to be taken
into account.
II.
HISTORICAL VIEW OF SIMULATIONS
From a long time ago, simulation and games have been
employed for training purposes. Their creation is tracked to
war games that were used in ancient China. War games,
mainly in the sort of wide games, like chess, have been well
known. In Germany, during the 17th century, they were
changed into more intellectual and composite games [9].
Game and Simulation first appeared in the wide educational
spot in the late 1950s. However, Lane declared in 1995 that
management diversions and simulations were in the news and
their utilization was expanding after fifteen years. Until the
mid-1970s, they did not exist in the instructional outline
development [10].
In the past, medical models were used as tools in the
study of anatomy; mainframe computer-based simulations
were generally utilized within the 1960s [11]. Ellington
announced in 1981 that computer-based simulations have
been used in science education at all levels.
In the last ten years, new simulation games have evolved
as teaching tools in marketing, financial management, project
management, knowledge management, risk management and
microeconomics [12].
III.
PEDAGOGICAL SIMULATIONS
A.
Types of pedagogical simulations
Computer simulation for pedagogic purposes, which
utilizes the computer as a learning domain, is called
computer-assisted learning (CAL). Those alleged "training
simulations" commonly come in one of three classifications,
according to Stančić  [13]: 
• "Live" simulation – real individuals utilize the simulated
device in the real setting,
• "Virtual" simulation – real individuals utilize the
simulated device in a virtual setting, and
• "Constructive" simulation – simulated individuals utilize
the simulated device in a virtual setting.
It is imperative to notice that in every one of the three
cases individuals manage the simulated device and that
demonstrates
the
distinction
among
simulation
and
experimentation. Data of science incorporates the greater
part of the above-mentioned employments of a computer and
classifications
of
simulation.
That
is
vital
for
the
improvement of long lasting learning, with an exceptionally
noteworthy part of between actions. The virtual simulation
was employed for this study that is framed around a
prototype of reality in which the children act, perform
certain roles, and make decisions essential to deal with the
intrinsic problematic cases and utilizing specific structured
equipment [14][15].
‘Helping Plants Grow Well’ is the title of simulation
employed, which allows students in both grades one and two
to investigate various quantities of the variables needed for
plant growth. The third grade simulation game is entitled
‘Habitat’ and teaches students about proper animal habitat,
and their position in the food chain. The fourth grade
simulation is entitled ‘Life Cycle’ and illustrates plant parts
and their functions. These simulations are present on BBC
website [16].
B.
Effectiveness along intrinsic motivation
Simulations based reviews have specified that it is a
compelling
educational
technique
for
theoretical
advancement in science and additionally formative appraisal
system, and suggested that it would have an advantageous
effect on reasonable change.
Numerous experimental
studies revealed
that simulation games intensify their
motivation,
including
ability,
intrigue
or
interest,
and
endeavors [17-19].
Students who experienced game based learning domain
exhibited
higher
statistical
significance
of
intrinsic
motivation
than
those
who
acquired
education
in
conventional school environment [20].
Simulations not only help students to comprehend the
material better, but also expand student’s interest for the
content of the material. In 2011, Neumann, Neumann, and
Hood [21] examined computer-based simulations in a school
statistic's course where 38 students consented to take part.
After the class, the students were reached for a 20 minutes
telephone call and their responses were put into defined
categories when possible. Utilizing the computer based
simulation assisted 66 % of students to experience the
actual-world application of the specific subject, assisted 60.5
% to comprehend and gain knowledge about the material,
created interest and attentiveness in 29 % of the students,
motivated 18 % of the students to discover and expanded
enjoyment in 16 % of the students.
IV.
RESEARCH METHOD
A systematic review comprised of five stages: (1)
recognition of research, (2) choice of primary studies, (3)
study quality appraisal, (4) data extraction and observing, and
(5) data analysis [22] was used. The main research objective
was to analyze the impact and execution of simulation games
in private schools and to investigate the interrelationships
between the barriers and the impact of other contextual
factors in the pedagogic environment.
A.
Data collection
The target population for the current study was students
at cycle’s one and two (6 -10 years old) from Family School
in Magdouche and National Evangelical School in Nabatieh.
Data was collected from March 20, 2017, untill April 25,
2017.
Participants were recruited from the science classes at
cycles one and two. The researchers selected the sample for
the study using stratified random because Robson [23]
contends that sampling theory supports stratified random
sampling as an efficient choice since the means of the
8

EMERGING 2017 : The Ninth International Conference on Emerging Networks and Systems Intelligence

stratified samples are likely to be closer to the mean of the
population overall.
The method of collecting data included both control/test
and pre/post groups, in addition to a hard copy of the
questionnaire, which was filled with the assistance of each
classroom teacher. A total of 158 responses were collected
from control/test group, and 308 responses at pre/post test
groups.
B.
Measurements
•
The control/test group results were compared and
discussed to prove the effectiveness of the research. Through
obtaining the mean, mode, standard deviation and standard
error.
•
The student’s questionnaire included three-likert
scale response (i.e., -1=disagree, 0=neutral, 1=agree). A
smiling face indicated that the students agree. A null face
indicated that the student is unaware of the answer, and an
unhappy face pointed for disagreeing. It was used with all
items.
•
The questionnaire was divided into five domains, and
within lays 21 items. The obtained results present the mean,
mode, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of each
item with their total values.
•
The pre/post test grades were compared to emphasize
on the pedagogic impact of the simulation game. The
obtained results presented the mean, standard deviation, and
standard error.
•
All students had no previous preparation for pre/post
test.
C.
Findings
The questionnaire was distributed to students, to measure
the impact of the simulation game on their academic
achievement. Students in cycle one were assisted by the
science teachers upon reading the preceding items.

On the other hand, a few students (2.8%) disagreed with that.
Concerning the effort exerted, the students’ perception was
positive, in which (50.8%) disagreed that the experienced
game demanded more effort. Explicitly, (74.6%) agreed that
simulation enhances social learning. Most of the students
(75.3%) agreed that the game instructions were easy to
understand, which made them do better. Only a few (2.9%)
of students did not agree that the game results represented
their decision, therefore the hypothesis suggesting that
simulation games enhance the decision-making capacity of
students has been corroborated.
D.
Data Analysis
The researchers started with comparing control-test
groups at the baseline, through a sample of 158 students
from National Evangelical School in Nabtieh. The stratified
random sample continued students from both cycle one and
two.

Table II shows that the average mean of the control group
was lower than that of the test group (7.932< 8.512). The
average score obtained by the control group is lower than that
of the test group (7<10), showing that the group learned
through
simulation
game
achieved
a
better
outcome.
However, the standard deviation of the control group was
higher than that of the test group (1.894> 1.534).
After comparing the control and test groups, which
revealed the academic progress of the test group students, the
researchers executed a study quality appraisal on pre-post test
groups. The same topic was taught to students at both
schools, where the pretest was done at the end of the
traditional educational method, while the post-test was done
at the end of the simulation.

Table III shows the grade results from both intended
schools. The pre and post-test were the same to exclude any
possible contamination. The mean value clearly reveals the
progress that students made upon the practice of simulation
game, in which their average increased by two grades
(7.355>9.020). However, the standard deviation was used to
measure the amount of variation of the set of pre/post data
values. It shows that the variation in pre-test group (1.986)
was higher than that of post-test group (1.068). Hence, the
simulation game experienced by the students was effective.
At the end of the science course, present students gave
their response to the questionnaire.

Table IV summarizes the result of participants' responses
to questionnaire items in the five domains: (1) educational
goal, (2) knowledge, (3) social learning and environment, (4)
student perception toward instruction, and (5) evaluation.
This summary indicates that students practice simulation
games at their schools with an overall mean of (0.607), mode
of (0.96), SD of (0.617), and CV of (141.29%). The highest
average
value
is
obtained
upon
testing
the
student’s
perception
toward
instruction
(0.706>0.654>0.605>0.580>0.490),
indicating
that
the
practice
of
simulation
games
enhance
the
student’s
recognition of provided instructions. The use of computerized
instructions within the simulation game provided a higher
academic achievement [24].
To study the effect of certain variables, the researchers
used the ANOVA test; it ia a parametric test used to compare
more than two means and to study if the difference is
significant or not. For the interpretation, p-value is compared
with α (error ratio = 5% i.e. 0.05). If p-value > α → the
researchers consider the difference insignificant and vice
versa.
Upon performing the ANOVA test, the obtained p-value
for students’ perspective toward simulation game in relation
with learning in a social environment was 0.00002, showing
that the null hypothesis is rejected and there is a significant
difference. The students who enjoy the simulation game don’t
necessarily perform better in teamwork.
While answering the hypothesis that tests the relation
between
simulation
game
effectiveness
and
education
operation management, the p-value obtained was 0.058,
which indicates that the null hypothesis is significant, and
therefore, the effectiveness of simulation game is affected by
the proper education operation management organization.
V.
CONCLUSION
The
analyzed
results
recommended
experiencing
a
simulation game for enhancing operations management in
regard to some issues, such as the game engaging quality,
appraisal system, and decision-making assessment. Appraisal
of group performance should be supplemented with the
individual performance assessment to guarantee decency in
checking. The utilization of this simulation should be
formally coordinated in the operations management course
syllabus for consistency over the academic years.
A.
Complications and limitations in this study
There were several limitations that the researchers
encountered in this study. The two principal limitations are:
1.
The lack of studies in Lebanon that have examined
simulation, and
2.
The
insufficiency
of
prior
research
studies
evaluating the effectiveness of embedding simulations as a
part of science education in primary schools.
Moreover,
diverse
studies
discussing
dissimilar
pedagogical programs and cultures, stated earlier, were
homogenous and similar to the findings of this research. A
further crucial reason is the lack of any study in Lebanon
done at the same time of this research that uses simulation in
the classroom to make use of its results and overcome the
possible obstacles faced by the researchers.
Consequently, in order to determine the effectiveness of
simulation gaming in science education in primary school,
further research is needed, which must focus on:
a)
Teachers
perspective
against
the
utilization of
simulation

b)
How encouraging the school administration is in
utilizing ICT
c)
Teacher skills in utilizing ICT, especially the ones
concerned with simulation gaming.
B.
Implications for further study in Lebanon
There is a deficiency of studies in Lebanon and other
Arab countries with the close pedagogical environment that
evaluates the degree of effectiveness of simulation games in
primary
schools
for
science
teaching.
Consequently,
researchers require supplementary studies to decide which
factors might reinforce or obstruct the implementation of
simulation in science teaching.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The researchers would like to extend their gratitude to the
science instructors and students who were involved in this
study, and to the Administrations of the Family School and
The National Evangelical School in Nabatieh.
