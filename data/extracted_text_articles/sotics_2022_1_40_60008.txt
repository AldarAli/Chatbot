Abstract—Although YouTube is the second most used social
media platform in the world today, there is a need for more
systematic research on video-based social network platforms, as
few studies provide insights into the dynamics of their online
discourse. Data, such as comments and other user engagement
statistics, give insight into what information content creators
are spreading and what moves communities. The analytical
framework utilized in this research presents a multidimensional
view into the geopolitical discourse on YouTube, with a focus
on
the
Indo-Pacific
region.
We
identified
major
YouTube
channels that were discourse movers on polarizing topics,
such as the treatment of Uyghur muslims, and COVID-19.
We provided context on information consumption behaviors of
these communities, as well as the engagement trends within
these channels. This revealed segregated communities that
often engaged in toxic behavior when clashing with opposite
communities, as well as some inorganic engagement trends,
allowing us to identify communities that may use automated
means to push their narrative.

I. INTRODUCTION
In this study, we approach how YouTube videos can and
have been used as vehicles of misinformation or political
propaganda. We observe content popular in the Indo-Pacific
region and explore three main topics: general discourse about
the Chinese government, the Uyghur crisis, and COVID-19.
Compared to the significant body of work that studies
the online discourse on social media platforms like Twitter,
there is little research on discourse within video-based social
networking platforms, such as YouTube, which is one of the
most popular platforms in the Asia-Pacific region. Carrying out
systematic research on video-sharing platforms like YouTube
provides immense opportunities to gain situational awareness
that could be pivotal in strategic policy making, especially in
trade and defense. Data, such as video titles, comments, views,
and likes can give insight into what information content cre-
ators and media houses are spreading along with the audience’s
engagement with those contents. Engagement statistics, such
as likes and views, could also serve as potential sources to
gain implicit knowledge about community interests on certain
topics. Analyzing trending and influential content on social
media platforms requires a rigorous, systematic approach and
could yield many benefits, helping stakeholders to detect
existing trends and content generators, track upcoming trends
and accompanying narratives, and how discourse evolves.
Through this research, we aim to present a methodological
pathway on how to identify suspicious and inorganic content
in cyber-influence operations. We use the word “suspicious”
when a message is being amplified through inorganic means:
through commenter bots, inorganic growth in a channel’s
subscribers, or a video’s views - driving traffic to the content.
The rest of this study is structured as follows. First, we
will discuss the work done by other researchers in comparable
research in Section 2, describe our methodology in Section
3, including data collection, processing, and topic modeling
methodology. Finally, in Section 4, we will discuss our find-
ings before offering closing thoughts.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Third party web traffic reports [1] tell us that YouTube is
the second most popular website, and accounts for 20.4% of
all search traffic. According to official YouTube sources [2], 1
billion hours of videos are watched each day. Another study
[3] found that 60% of YouTube videos are watched at least
10 times on the day they are posted. The researchers also
highlighted that, if a video does not attract viewership in the
first few days after upload, it will likely not gain traction later
on. YouTube provides an overwhelming amount of video data,
with over 500 hours of content uploaded every minute on
average. That number was 300 in 2013 [4]. In previous publi-
cations [5, 6], we identified YouTube as a potential vehicle of
misinformation and proposed the use of YouTube metadata for
understanding and visualizing these phenomena by observing
data trends. Previous research [7] has studied engagement
patterns of YouTube videos and highlighted the related videos
engagement trends, later designated as the “rabbit hole effect”,
where users will be recommended increasingly relevant videos.
In some cases of polarizing content, this effect has been shown
to be a contributing factor to user radicalization [8]. Recent
research on the same subject leverages advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques on text entities, such
as video comments [9] but we could find little work available
on the video content itself.
It is important to provide some social and political context
for this work. One major key idea of this study is China’s
desire to develop a 21st-century Maritime Silk Road coined

as the belt and road initiative. One of the important hubs for
the project Xinjiang, is home to Uyghurs Muslims [10]. The
People’s Republic of China has opened a number of what it
calls “vocational education” camps, claiming to de-radicalize
extremists individuals in the area. However, the West has
called it cultural genocide and political brainwashing. The
government of China is taking a range of countermeasures to
mitigate those claims by utilizing the video-sharing platform
YouTube. In these videos, content creators are calling the
West hypocrites who are spreading fake news, and producing
content mimicking trusted news channels like CNN [11].
While this type of content increases misinformation and gives
raise to propaganda, it can have a severe impact on society.
For instance, during COVID-19, 87 % of the users encountered
relevant misinformation that suggested consuming ethanol or
bleach as preventative measures for COVID-19 [12]. Similarly,
politicizing YouTube content gave rise to anti-Asian hatred
with the use of words like Chinese virus to refer to the
pandemic [13]. Other research [14] suggests that this type
of content is heavily concentrated among a small group that
has high prior racial resentment. In contrast, YouTube content
has been utilized to create public awareness as well. Studies
[15] suggest that many content creators used the platform as
a mean to convey information about diseases, interviewing
subject matter experts, giving evidence and argument.
III. METHODOLOGY
This study uses a three-step methodology to assess YouTube
content’s suspiciousness. First, we collected YouTube video
metadata and comments, separated them according to the main
narrative they pushed, and performed engagement and network
analysis on each of the subsets identified.
A. Narrative Segregation
We collected data from YouTube using a group of keywords
relating to each narrative theme provided by subject matter
experts from Arizona State University. The relevant keywords
were identified by studying coverage in the Indo-Pacific region
with further reviews to improve the inclusiveness. A data
collection task was set up for each narrative using the group of
keywords as a parameter to pull YouTube data relating to the
narrative. To perform an analysis on a narrative, we queried
our database using the keywords in the full-text search query.
Table II is a snippet of the keywords for each narrative and
Table I shows total collection statistics. YouTube data was
collected using the official YouTube Data API and following
the methodology described by Kready et al. [16].

B. Engagement Analysis
To uncover any suspicious activity within the channels
found in our research, we examined the engagement trends
over certain periods. Our analysis includes time series data
based on channels’ activity trends, such as, daily view count,
daily subscriber count, daily video count, total views, total
subscribers, total comments, and total videos; following the
methodology described by Kirdemir et al. [17].
Engagement trend analysis was executed on the channels we
collected data for, to discover channels exhibiting suspicious
behaviors. There are 5 key steps employed by the script in
discovering suspicious behaviors in a channel:
1) Rolling window correlation analysis
2) Anomaly detection
3) Rule-based classification
4) Principal component analysis
5) Clustering
The first step is the rolling window correlation analysis
that groups the data into a rolling window of 100 days
and computes the pairwise correlation between the video
production and engagement metrics for each window. It aims
to capture channels inauthentic behaviors by analyzing the
correlation between engagement metrics, e.g. channels with
increasing views, but decreasing subscribers. The output from
this step is the start and end date for each window and the
value for correlation pairs between the metrics:
• Views and subscribers
• Views and videos
• Views and comments
• Subscribers and videos
• Subscribers and comments
• Videos and comments
The output from the rolling window correlation analysis
goes into the anomaly detection step to train a Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) model on the time series data and
identify anomalies in the correlation between engagement
metrics. LSTM models are artificial neural networks that,
unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, use feedback
connections. This lets the model process not only single data
points, but also entire sequences of data by using a recurrent
network. To capture anomalous periods, a threshold was set to
average peak of the data for each channel’s correlation pairs to
capture all data points that were placed above that threshold.
To compute the anomaly threshold, we grouped the data
into a rolling window of 100 days, then computed the pairwise
correlation between the video engagement metrics. The output
from this was passed into the anomaly detection step, where
the data was trained on the LSTM model. It ran through each
dataset (1000 data points approximately, where one data point
represents 100 days) with a batch size of 32 and a lookback
size of 1. The loss from the computation was represented as the
anomaly confidence score. To capture the anomalous periods,
the threshold was set to the anomaly confidence score for each
channel’s correlation pair. This resulted in a list containing the
anomalous data points for each correlation pair.

A rule-based classification algorithm was used to determine
a suspicion score ranging from 0 (least suspicious) to 1 (most
suspicious) for each engagement metric pair. The suspicion
scores for all indicators are then aggregated to create a single
suspicion score for each observation.
C. Network Analysis
The YouTube co-commenter network represents the con-
nections between commenters on YouTube videos, where the
edge weight indicates the number of videos they commented
on together. To identify the communities in the network, we
used the ForceAtlas2 layout in Gephi, a force-directed layout
similar to other algorithms used in network spatialization. This
also showed the top node in each community, and the type of
content the community engaged with. The modularity measure
was used to partition the network into clusters or communities.
As the degree centrality measure was used to find out the top
nodes, it also shows how many ties/edges a node has. Once the
node information was extracted for all nodes in a community,
our dataset is queried to extract samples of the content some
of the nodes engaged with.
IV. RESULTS
In this section, we discuss the thoughts of our data collection
team and the ground truth as they were observed, and compare
these with the results obtained through our topic modeling
visualization tool. The results show YouTube co-commenters
networks for the different Indo-Pacific narratives where edges
between commenters indicate that the commenters were active
in 10 or more of the same videos. The results highlight the
top nodes and different communities in the network. It also
shows the type of content that the members of the various
communities engaged with or shared. We notice that the
communities tend to converge towards news channels, and then
segregate based on their preferred narrative.

Fig. 1. China narrative (February – August 2021).
Figure 1 illustrates some of the data shown in Table III. It
highlights three communities. The majority of the channels
from community 0 publish videos relating to China. It is
labelled as such due to the presence of high viewership videos,
such as “Xi Jinping: China’s president and his quest for
world power”, and “Global brands face backlash in China for
rejecting Xinjiang cotton”. The comments from the top nodes
in this community showed support for China, but showed
some robotic or translated patterns, e.g., “CPC is indeed the
Chinese people’s party. Long may it stay strong”, “Long live
the people’s Republic of China”.
Videos in community 1 discussed China centenary cele-
bration. It is labelled as such due to the presence of high
viewership videos, such as “Xi Jinping leads celebrations
marking centenary of China’s ruling Communist Party”, and
“China’s largest military parade marks National Day”. The
comments from two of the top nodes in this community were
pro-China with comments on Chinas’ centenary celebration
and others. While the comments from the other node were anti-
China, and were critical of the decision to hold the celebration
while citizens’ grievances went unaddressed.
Top videos in community 3 also captured polarizing videos
from other communities, which tended to communicate anti-
China sentiment, e.g., “Taiwan: ’China preparing for final
military assault”, and “Global brands face backlash in China
for rejecting Xinjiang cotton”. The comments made by the top
nodes in this community were vehemently anti-China, with
comments such as: “Of the 14 countries bordering China, it
has conflict with 13 of them including Russia”, and “Without
constant lying (on top of intimidation) the Chinese regime
can’t exist”.

B. Network Analysis - Uyghur Narrative (February – August
2021)
Figure 2 illustrates some of the data shown in Table IV.
It highlights four communities. In community 0, we noticed
the top videos focused on Chinas’ forced labor camps and
the oppression of the Uyghurs, e.g., “Uyghurs Who Fled
China Now Face Repression in Pakistan”, “What’s happening
with China’s Uighurs? — Start Here”, and “GLOBALink
— Chinese scholars debunk ”forced labor” claims with own
investigation”. The comments made by top nodes in this
community showed support to China and referred to China’s
oppression of the Uyghur Muslims as accusations. They also
showed dislike for the western media.
The top videos in the nodes community 1 engaged with
tended to be educational content, with titles such as “How
Xinjiang Became Muslim ft. Let’s Talk Religion”, and “What’s
China’s ’re-education camp’ in Xinjiang really about?”. The
comments from the top nodes in this community were mixed.
One showed support for China and talked about how western
media frames China as negative in their news, with another
top node being anti-China.
Top videos in community 2 included content from popular
politainment channels, such as “Last Week Tonight with John
Oliver” and “VICE News”, and also featured engaging titles,
such as “China’s Vanishing Muslims: Undercover In The Most
Dystopian Place In The World”. The comments made by
the top nodes in this community were very polarized and
argumentative, with both sides of the issues present.
The channels in community 3 share educational content
on Islam, with top video in this community pertaining to
the teachings of Islam. The title of the videos, translated
to English, includes: “Extraordinary Ustadz Abdul Somad
answered all the questions of this Malaysian congregation”,
and “2 ways to ask for God’s help — Palembang”. The
comments from the top nodes were positive, and praised the
speakers and their material.

Figure 3 illustrates some of the data shown in Table V.
It highlights three communities.
In community 0, we once
again see mostly News channels, including “CGTN”, “New
China TV”, “球Global Times’, “DW News”, and “China Daily
中日”.
Most of the top videos in this community include
content from the “China Global Television Network” (CGTN)
channel and include “Fighting Together: China sends aid to
Colombia to combat virus”, and “Ambassador Lin Songtian
discusses China-Africa pandemic aid”. Most videos seemed to
discuss Chinese international aid in vaccine distribution. The

comments made by the top nodes in this community showed
high toxicity and attacked the video content, as well as the
other commenters. The top nodes showed polarized attitudes
in regards to China, as well as inorganic behavior. Notable,
one of the top nodes posted emojis exclusively.
The top nodes in community 1 engaged with the videos
listed below, with a majority of videos making reference to
China, e.g., “The Truth About The COVID Origin and the Lab
Leak Theory”, and “China says it has not received COVID-19
aid from U.S. government”. We noticed obviously inorganic
behavior, with some of the comments made by one of the top
nodes, with repeating comments for every video commented
on. The comments from the other two nodes hinted towards the
commenters being pro-China: “China is the future”, “China is
a good example for the world”, etc.
Videos the top nodes from community 2 engaged with only
include two news channels: CGTN, and News China TV. Top
videos from these channels discussed COVID-19 aid, e.g.,
“Medical teams return home with Wuhan in their hearts”, and
“Why did Sichuan experts volunteer to help Italy?”. Comments
were consistent with this pro-China sentiment.
D. Engagement Trends Analysis - Indo-Pacific Channels
Engagement trend analysis is used to uncover channel-
level suspicious activity on YouTube by processing metrics of
video production and engagement through a multi-step ana-
lytical pipeline including rolling window correlation analysis,
anomaly detection, peak detection, rule-based classification,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and unsupervised clus-
tering. From the list of 5,000 Indo-Pacific channel ids col-
lected, we were able to get daily data on 3,517 channels from
Social Blade, an online tool tracking social media statistics and
analytics, commonly used for traffic and earnings estimations.
Figure 4 shows the output of the anomaly detection model,
which returned anomalous periods with a large feature set.
PCA was then used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset
and a scatterplot was created using the first two principal
components and the suspicion score was used to color the
data point, as reported in Table VI, which shows the highest
scores. Once the suspicion score was generated for every
observation of the 3,517 Indo-Pacific channels, the channel
with the highest suspicion score was “Breaking News TV”
with a suspicion score of 0.72. The anomalous period for this
data point occurred between 2019-03-24 and 2019-10-08. The
channel has now been taken down.
The final step was using Density-Based Spatial Clustering
of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to identify clusters
(groups of channels with similar engagement trends) from the
PCA scatter plot - see Figure 5. Figure 5 matches Figure 4 and
helps match communities to trends of suspicious engagement.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this study, we presented a multi-dimensional analysis
of popular political and societal discourse in the Indo-Pacific
region. We focused on YouTube, the second most used social
media platform in the world today, and highly popular in the

Indo-Pacific region, as a source of information and entertain-
ment. To understand the patterns behind these online discourse
dynamics, the interests of these communities, and the content
preferences of the discourse movers (channels), we used
network analysis and narrative segregation to identify various
communities within YouTube networks, and provided context
on their information consumption behaviors and engagement
metrics. This revealed highly polarized user to user interac-
tions, as well as some inorganic engagement trends, allowing
us to identify “suspicious” communities. Through this study,
we want to present the pathway on how to analyze video-
based platforms, especially YouTube, to obtain situational
awareness during any social cyber-influence operation. Future
points of improvement for this research include considering
bot accounts and their impact, and further automating the
process of connecting community detection and clustering to
engagement trends, creating a suspicion score at the commu-
nity level instead of the channel level. This will allow analysts
