Abstract—Biometric authentication uses unique physical or
behavioural patterns in humans to identify individuals. Though
biometric is generally considered most reliable, stable and unique
among all entity authentication means, it is not as stable and
unique as is usually conceived. In this paper, we highlight the
issues with current state-of-the-art iris-based biometric authen-
tication systems. This survey covers the review of existing iris
recognition methods with a focus on enumerating the open issues
that must be addressed in order to be more conﬁdent in the
performance, security and privacy aspects of iris-based biometric
systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the increase in use of biometrics for human identi-
ﬁcation, control shifts to identifying the factors that affect
the performance of biometric authentication systems. Bio-
metric authentication systems use behavioural or physical
characteristics to authenticate a user. These systems have
become more reliable sources of authentication as compared
to the traditional means like passwords or hardware tokens
such as smart cards. Reliability of biometric authentication
systems lies in the fact that, unlike passwords and smart cards,
biometrics cannot easily be forged, shared, compromised or
forgotten. Biometric is considered to be highly unique among
all human population. Genetically, same identities including
twins and irises of left and right eye of the same person rep-
resent different iris patterns [8]. Another important property of
biometric is its stability [23][24][25][34]. In this paper, we will
critically analyse these claims by showing counter-examples
from other researchers’ work. These will be discussed in the
problems and open issues section in detail.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
provides an overview of existing iris recognition methods.
Section III presents issues, problems and challenges associated
with template security and recognition performance. The paper
is concluded in Section IV.
II. IRIS RECOGNITION
Iris recognition is considered as one of the most reli-
able biometric authentication technique [9][19][35][37]. An iris
recognition system captures human eye image using a near
infrared iris sensor which passes through three steps to be
transformed into an iris template. These three steps are iris
segmentation, iris normalization and iris feature encoding.
The iris segmentation procedure segments the annular iris
region from the entire eye image. First, it ﬁnds the inner
and outer boundaries (the iris-pupil and iris-sclera boundaries)
of the iris, then it marks the region of the annular iris ring
that is not visible due to eyelids and eyelashes. The iris
normalization procedure transforms the segmented iris region
into a ﬁxed size to cater for variations in iris sizes among
different eye images. The feature encoding procedure extracts
the most distinguishing features from normalized iris images
and typically encodes the result as a binary string.
Recognition involves either veriﬁcation or identiﬁcation.
Veriﬁcation is one to one comparison where claim of an
identity is veriﬁed, e.g., an employee of an ofﬁce. On the
contrary, identiﬁcation is one to many comparison where an
identity is watched against an entire database, e.g., a criminal
surveillance system. In the veriﬁcation step, the recognition
time captured image is compared with the image taken at the
enrolment time. The comparison is mostly done by calculating
the Hamming distance where a value of 0 represents a perfect
match and a value of 1 represents perfect non-match.
This paper is not primarily a survey on iris recognition
techniques, but is to identify performance and security related
issues with existing techniques. So, we will brieﬂy describe
just a couple of representative systems, followed by a table,
reproduced from [5], providing a comparative analysis of a
number of state-of-the-art iris recognition systems.
The most famous iris biometric system is due to Daugman
[7][8]. In Daugman’s system, iris segmentation is performed
by using the following optimization:
max
(r,x0,y0)
Gσ(r) ∗ ∂
∂r
I
C(s;r,x0,y0)
I(x, y)
2πr
ds
 ,
where r and (x0, y0) are candidates for the radius and center of
the iris, Gσ(r) is the one-dimensional Gaussian with standard
deviation σ, ∗ is the convolution operator, C(s; r, x0, y0) is the
circular closed curve with center (x0, y0) and radius r, param-
eterized by s, and I(·, ·) is the input eye image. Noise due to
eyelids occlusion is avoided by restricting ds to the nearly
vertical regions. The above optimization is performed twice
to ﬁnd both iris and pupil circles. For template generation,
Daugman uses phase information of the image. After detecting
the iris boundaries and removing the irrelevant region, 2D

Gabor wavelets is applied on normalized iris image to the
iris template. For comparison of iris templates, Hamming
distance metric is used. Most of the subsequent work on iris
recognition, follows Daugman’s approach of using Hamming
distance for template matching
After Daugman’s iris recognition system, one of the most
important and popular systems is due to Wildes [38][39]. For
iris segmentation, Wildes ﬁrst detects edges in the eye image
and then applies a circular Hough transform to ﬁnd circular
pupil and iris boundaries. Much of the subsequent work on
iris segmentation follows Wildes approach where a common
variation is the usage of a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy. For template
generation, Wildes uses Laplacian of Gaussian ﬁlter applied at
multiple scales to extract unique information from iris texture.
His system uses normalized correlation between the templates
for template matching at veriﬁcation time.
As mentioned above, most of the subsequent work in iris
recognition follows the above-mentioned seminal approaches.
Most work on iris segmentation is a variation and enhancement
of Wildes’ approach, while most feature extraction schemes
are variations on Daugman’s wavelet-based approach. A very
nice detailed survey of iris recognition techniques is due to [5].
Table I (reproduced from [5]) provides a quick comparison of
recognition results for some of the important iris recognition
techniques. The interested reader is referred to [5] for a
detailed study of existing iris recognition techniques.
III. PROBLEMS AND OPEN ISSUES
We categorize issues of iris recognition systems in two
broad classes namely those related to iris template security and
those associated with iris recognition performance. Details are
as follows.
A. Iris Template Security
As biometric is an integral part of human body, loss of one’s
biometric corresponds to loss of his/her identity. Therefore,
security of biometric templates is one of the most important
concerns in any biometric authentication system. In literature,
we found four types of biometric systems which are described
below along with related issues and challenges.
1) Traditional Biometric Systems: These are the conven-
tional systems [7][25][38] which store users’ templates in clear
form to verify the identity. A template is generated at enrol-
ment time, stored in the database without encryption/hashing
and compared with the corresponding veriﬁcation template
at the veriﬁcation time. As the template is used and stored
in plaintext, a compromise of database has severe security
and privacy implications. There are scenarios where users
use the same biometrics for multiple applications or different
organizations share data among themselves for their users. In
such scenarios, cross-matching becomes feasible for tracking
individual users [27][30][31].
2) Biometric Key Release: These are the systems where
biometrics along with cryptographic keys are used for au-
thentication and communication [32]. The effort lies in using
biometric templates effectively to release cryptographic keys

in a secure manner. Modern cryptographic keys are uniformly
random and large in size, therefore it is not feasible for
users to memorize them. In biometric key release systems,
cryptographic keys are stored at some location and are released
using biometric information of the user. When user inputs
his/her biometric, cryptographic key is released for use in any
security protocol. This way, the key would be released only
to the authorized users.
Though these systems use biometric information effectively
for cryptographic key storage and release, there are certain
issues which are not addressed by these systems. First, though
these systems secure cryptographic key using biometric tem-
plate, the template itself still remains unprotected. This leads to
all security and privacy issues discussed earlier. Second, these
systems fail to provide revocability of biometric templates
meaning that if it is known that biometric template of a
24

particular user has been compromised, it is not feasible for
him/her to change his/her secret in contrast to password or
hardware token-based systems.
3) Cancelable Biometrics: Cancelable biometric systems
apply some transformation on the biometric template to secure
the template [6][21][33][42]. The idea is that, instead of
directly storing the template, a function is applied on the
template and the output of that function (transformed template)
is stored in the database. The transformation function must
be non-invertible so that a compromised transformed template
cannot be translated to the original template. The major
advantage of cancelable biometric systems is that even if the
transformed template is compromised, the original template
still remains secure. In addition, the secret can easily be
revoked by applying a different transformation to the original
template resulting in a new transformed template. Moreover,
a user can have different transformed templates for different
applications he/she is using hence making cross-matching
infeasible for any potential attacker.
Finding a suitable transformation function can be quite
tricky in cancelable biometric systems. Standard non-invertible
transformation functions (such as one-way cryptographic hash
functions) do not work with biometric data due to intra-
class variability of biometric data. Therefore, in most cases,
transformation is user-dependent, i.e., user either has to re-
member a password/pin or to carry a token which stores
the transformation parameters. This puts an extra burden on
the user and effectively converts the system into two-factor
authentication scheme. It is also desirable to observe user
speciﬁc key to check the strength of user-provided secret.
4) Biometric Key Generation:
In such systems, bio-
metric template and cryptographic key are bind together
[11][14][20][22][26][41]. Cryptographic key can either be
generated directly from biometric template [14][20][22][41]
or by using standard cryptographic techniques [11][26]. In
former case, generated key is not uniform and hence may not
be strong enough for use in many cryptographic protocols. In
biometric key generation systems, neither biometric template
nor cryptographic key is stored in cleartext. Instead, a value
obtained by binding these two secrets is stored such that it
is not feasible to get any of the two secrets from this bound
value.
Though last three non-traditional systems described above
are quite effective in resolving template security related issues
in biometric recognition systems, in most cases, recognition
performance is affected. In addition, speed of these systems
is always slower as compared to conventional iris recognition
systems. Moreover, most of these systems do not perform well
with noisy iris image datasets. Due to all these issues, we can
conclude that a reliable and efﬁcient solution to solve template
security related issues is yet to be achieved.
B. Iris Recognition Performance
An iris recognition system is considered ideal when match
and non-match distributions do not overlap each other. There
are a few factors which may lead to a signiﬁcant drop in
accuracy of iris recognition systems. These are detailed as
follows.
1) Dilation: One of the important but often ignored factor
is pupil dilation. Due to dilation effects, we have varying size
of pupil, which results in decreased recognition performance.
Dilation may occur due to many factors such as drugs,
sunglasses, light illumination, etc.
Experimental studies are presented by Hollingsworth et al.
identifying the effects of pupil dilation on iris recognition
performance [15][16]. To produce dilation, they used ambient
light for controlled intervals of time. Degree of dilation was
measured by taking the fraction of pupil and iris radius. They
conducted two experiments, one to ﬁnd out the effects of
dilation of same degree (between two templates to be matched)
and second with varying dilation. Their ﬁndings indicate that
1) If both images have same but high pupil dilation, this results
in lower recognition performance as compared to images
with no dilation. 2) If images have different amount of pupil
dilation, this results in further increasing of False Reject Rate
(FRR).
Effects of pupil dilation on iris recognition performance
have been studied by other researchers also [4][10][29]. Rakshit
and Monro [29] have used eye drops to achieve the effects of
dilation. For their experiments, they collected images before
and after 5, 10 and 15 minutes of instilling of drops. In
most cases, due to the instillation of drops, pupil lost its
shape and they used their shape-description method to generate
accurate normalized images. Their experiments also showed
a decrease in recognition performance due to iris dilation.
They also observed that, with the increase in time, dilation
is increased leading to an increase in FRR. Dhir et al. [10]
later extended their study with 15 subjects as compared to 11
in [29]. They found the same results namely dilation results in
poor performance and false reject rate increases with increase
in dilation which in turn increases with time after eye drops
have been administered.
Bowyer et al. [4] categorized iris images in three classes
based on amount of pupil dilation namely small, medium and
large. For experiments with varying amount of dilation, their
results show that the larger the difference in dilation ratio, the
more the chances of false non-match. For experiments with
same amount of dilation, their ﬁndings indicate that increasing
the degree of dilation, increases the false match and false non-
match.
From the above studies, it can safely be concluded that it
is not that difﬁcult to deceive iris recognition systems which
is contrary to the popular belief in research community. Pupil
dilation not only affects the recognition performance but an
intruder can easily deceive the system by just wearing sun-
glasses or by using eye drops. Pupil dilation factor should be
incorporated in iris recognition systems to increase conﬁdence
in recognition results.
2) Lenses: Around the world, approximately 125 million
people use contact lenses. Therefore, iris recognition systems
should be ﬂexible enough to accommodate these large number
of people. Designers of iris recognition algorithms claim that
25

PATTERNS 2012 : The Fourth International Conferences on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

recognition performance of their systems is not affected by
the use of contact lenses[1][8][28][40]. But, recently, Baker et
al. [2] come up with a study showing that every type of lens
negatively affects iris recognition performance. They used a
dataset containing 51 subjects with contact lens and 64 without
lenses. After visual inspection of iris images, they categorized
lenses into four categories. First category includes lenses that
are visible but have no effects on the iris. Second category
includes images that result in light or dark outline around iris
and sclera. Third category includes lenses with large artefacts
on the iris that are mainly due to written logo/number or misﬁt
lens. Fourth category is one having subjects with hard lenses.
They conducted two experiments. First experiment com-
pares results of contact lenses and non-contact lenses subjects
while the second experiment compares results of different
categories of contact lenses. In ﬁrst experiment, false reject
rate for subjects with lenses is 9.42% and 0.719% for subjects
without contact lenses. This shows that contact lenses have
a severely adverse effect on iris recognition accuracy. The
second experiment showed that second category is the one with
the lowest FRR of 3.9% whereas fourth category has highest
FRR of 45.44%. Category one and three have also shown high
false reject rates of 10.64% and 14.37%, respectively. As is
clear from results, lenses of all types affect the veriﬁcation
results little or more depending on the type.
Baker et al. [3] later conducted a larger study on the
effects of lenses. They used three different systems for iris
recognition namely IrisBEE, VeriEye and CMU. They also
categorised lenses in four types. The results show that false
reject rate for subjects with lenses is much higher than that
for subject without lenses. In addition, category four of hard
lenses showed worst recognition results among all lens types
for all three iris recognition systems.
Bowyer et al. [4] conducted a similar study to evaluate
iris recognition performance among subjects wearing contact
lenses. Their ﬁndings are that false non-match score was
almost same for contact lens and non-contact lens groups while
false match score was 0.27% for non-contact lens group and
5.64% for contact lens group showing a signiﬁcant drop in
recognition accuracy. From the above reported studies and
results, the effects of the contact lenses are apparent on recog-
nition performance. All types of lenses result in performance
degradation so there is need to introduce techniques that can
handle such scenarios to strengthen iris biometric systems.
3) Twins: In [17][18], Hollingworth et. al presented studies
identifying the texture similarities between irises of twins.
Their work is in contrast to the previous work which focuses
on identifying the differences between genetically same iden-
tities. To conduct their experiments, they collected the data on
twins day festival Twinburg in Ohio in August 2009.
They also collected the data from unrelated people to do
comparative analysis. At ﬁrst step, they performed biometric
system testing and their ﬁndings are same as those of the old
researchers, i.e., for iris biometric system, irises of twins are
more or like similar as those belonging to unrelated people.
At the second step, they performed user testing to identify
similarities between irises of twins.
They conducted two user studies. First, where only irises
of subjects are presented to respond to the queries and second
where periocular images are displayed to the user to respond
to the queries. On the iris image experiments, the average
success score is 81.3% and for periocular queries success
score is 76.5%. Their ﬁndings indicate that there are simi-
larities between the irises of genetically same users which can
be visually identiﬁed, but current biometric systems do not
identify them. It is required to explore further and establish
techniques so that biometric systems may utilize this visual
similarity between genetically similar irises for the beneﬁt of
performance enhancement.
4) Time Variability: Human iris is considered stable over
time [23][24][25][34]; but, a recent study by Gonzalez et al. [36]
shows results which contradict what has been demonstrated
so far. For their experimental evaluation, Gonzalez et al. used
BioSecurId [12] and BioSec [13] baseline datasets. The former
dataset consist of 254 individuals (8128 images) captured
in four different sessions and later has 200 subjects (3200
images) captured in two different sessions, both splitted by a
time span of one to four weeks. Results show that errors rate
is increased in inter-session experiments compared with the
intra-session ones. Their ﬁnding indicates that, as the lapse
time between enrolment and comparison is increased, false
accept rate remains unaffected but false reject rate is increased
up to more than twice. Bowyer et al. [4] conducted a similar
research to ﬁnd the effect of time variability on recognition
performance. Their recognition results also showed that as the
time between enrolment and veriﬁcation increases, false reject
rate of the system also increases though that increase is less
signiﬁcant than that reported by Gonzalez et al. Although,
research results show that time variability affects veriﬁcation
performance but to be more conﬁdent in extent of this effect,
more research with large datasets is desirable.
5) Cataract Surgery: In [10] Dhir et al. and [29] Rakshit
et al. identiﬁed the effects of cataract surgery on recognition
performance. In [29], they collected the images of 3 patients
before and after two weeks of cataract surgery. The results of
pre and post surgery images comparison shows that cataract
surgery does not affect recognition performance. Later on,
Dhir et al. [10] did similar experiments with 15 subjects and
found same results. Although the study is signiﬁcant, but as
the dataset was not large, there is need to do more experiments
on larger datasets to explore the effects.
6) System Portability: To check system portability related
issues, Bowyer et al. [4] performed experiments on a set of iris
images acquired using different sensors namely LG 2200 and
LG 4400. Experiments show false reject rate is higher when
both images (enrolment and veriﬁcation) are from different
sensors compared with the results where both images are from
the same sensor. The study is done on limited dataset and only
using IrisBEE software. There are chances that results may
be affected differently by different software and hardware. A
larger research is needed to explore effect of different sensors
on iris recognition performance.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This review paper summarizes the issues and challenges
with current iris biometric systems. In particular, we discussed
security and performance related issues. We have shown that
many popular beliefs about security, reliability, stability and
performance of iris recognition systems are not correct and
need to be revisited. The issues raised in this survey should
be addressed in order to be more conﬁdent in working of
iris recognition systems. In the future, we plan to explore the
security and privacy concerns facing other biometric systems.
This could lead to a design of multi-biometric system that
overcomes the weaknesses of one by the strength of other
biometric.
