Abstract—A Gaussian function for clipping associated to a
Tone Reservation ﬁltering is presented in this paper in order to
decrease multicarrier Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The
advantage of this approach is twofold: ﬁrst, the Gaussian clipping
function is a soft non-linear function which keeps constant the
average power of the signal, which is a characteristic of great
importance in real transmission; second, the Tone Reservation
ﬁltering by inserting the corrected signal on reserved carriers
guaranties a complete downward compatibility (it means that
the receiver does not need to be changed with the update of the
transmitter) with classical receivers. The ﬁltering is performed
in the frequency domain by putting the corrected signal on
the free carriers of the considered standard (in our case the
Wiﬁ IEEE802.11). Furthermore, our approach does not need
any side information. In addition to the previous advantages,
extensive simulations show very interesting performance in the
complexity/PAPR decreasing trade-off compared to others similar
methods.

I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), al-
though used in many standards such as 4G and 5G, IEEE
802.11a/g, IEEE 802.16, HIPERLAN/2, and Digital Video
Broadcasting (DVB), is prone to high Peak-to-Average Power
Ratios (PAPR). Large PAPR values require linear High Power
Ampliﬁers (HPA), which is not energy efﬁcient. The combina-
tion of an insufﬁciently linear HPA with a signal of large PAPR
values leads to in and out of band distortions as explained in
[1] which was the starting point of this paper.
A huge quantity of works on PAPR topic has been published
for decades along two axes: ﬁnd its theoretical distribution
and/or propose powerful methods to mitigate its high values.
The reader may ﬁnd some last developments in different
contexts in [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].
The simplest way to reduce PAPR is to deliberately clip
and ﬁlter the OFDM signal before ampliﬁcation. However,
clipping is a nonlinear process and may cause signiﬁcant
distortions that degrade the Bit Error Rate (BER) and increase
adjacent out-of-band carriers [7]. To avoid this degradation
the solution we proposed in [8] consists in transforming any
adding mitigation method into Tone Reservation (TR) method
by an adequate frequency domain ﬁltering. Thus, the resulting
PAPR mitigation method is fully downward compatible and
does not deteriorate the useful signal. The contributions of
this paper which is an extension of [1] are:
• ﬁrst, we propose a new clipping function, the Gaussian
clipping (GC) function, which has the main advantage,
compared to other clipping functions of the literature, to
keep constant the average power.
• second, we transform this GC function into a TR method,
thanks to the method described in [8]. The resulting Gaus-
sian Tone Reservation Clipping and Filtering method is a
fully downward compatible method, whose performance
depend on the number of reserved tones. Because the
ﬁltering process is included by principle in the TR method
we will refer to Tone Reservation with Gaussian Clipping
Function (TR-GCF).
• third, we compute the complexity of the method and show
that the TR-GCF mitigation method offers the best trade-
off between PAPR reduction, average power variation and
complexity.
After a recall of some basics regarding OFDM in Section II,
we present in Section III the clipping functions of the literature
and the proposed Gaussian clipping function is presented in
Section III-D. Section IV deals with theoretical performance
of the Gaussian clipping function and Section V compares its
performance with other clipping functions. Section VI deals
with the use of Tone Reservation method with Gaussian clip-
ping and the associated algorithm while Section VII presents
simulation results in the context of WLAN systems. Section
VIII concludes the paper.

In this paper, the discrete-time indexing [n] denotes Nyquist
rate samples. Since oversampling is required in practice, we
will introduce the notation x [n/L] to denote oversampling by
a factor of L. Several oversampling strategies of x [n/L] can
be deﬁned. From now on, the oversampled IDFT output will
refer to an oversampled of (2), which is expressed as follows
x [n/L]

The PAPR of the signal x (t) is deﬁned as
PAPR[x]
∆=
max
t∈[0,Ts] |x (t)|2
Px
,
(4)
where Px = E
n
|x (t)|2o
is the average signal power and
E {.} is the statistical expectation operator. Note that, in order
to accurately describe the PAPR, an oversampling factor L ≥
4 is required. In fact, the PAPR is practically computed in
the analog domain and hence, to "see" the peaks between the
samples, we need to oversample the signal with regards to the
symbol frequency.
In the literature, it is customary to use the Complementary
Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the PAPR as a
performance criterion. It is given by
CCDF[x] (ψ)
∆= Pr

PAPR[x] ≥ ψ
	
.
Accordingly the PAPR reduction gain ∆PAPR is deﬁned as
the gap between PAPR before and after applying a reduction
method, for a given probability level.
III. CLIPPING FUNCTIONS
In this section, we ﬁrst present clipping techniques [18] and
the Gaussian clipping used in the remainder of the paper.
Whatever the clipping technique to reduce PAPR, the output
signal yn, in terms of the input signal xn is given as follows:
yn = f (|xn|) ejϕn,
(5)
where ϕn is the xn phase and f (.) is the clipping function.
A. Classical Clipping technique
The Classical Clipping proposed in [7], [20] is one of the
most popular clipping technique for PAPR reduction known
in the literature. It is sometimes called hard clipping and to
avoid any confusion, it is called Classical Clipping (CC) in
this paper. In [7], its effects on the performance of OFDM,
including the power spectral density, the PAPR and BER have
been evaluated. The function used for CC technique is deﬁned
below and depicted in Fig. 1(a):
f (r) =
(
r,
r ≤ A
A,
r > A ,
(6)
where A is the clipping threshold.
B. Deep Clipping technique
Deep Clipping (DC) has been proposed in [22] to solve the
peaks regrowth issue due to the out-of-band ﬁltering of the
classical clipping and ﬁltering method. In DC technique, the
clipping function is modiﬁed in order to “deeply” clip the high
amplitude peaks. A parameter called clipping depth factor has
been introduced in order to control the depth of the clipping.
The function-based clipping used for DC technique is deﬁned
below and depicted in Fig. 1(b):
f (r) =

r ≤ A
A − β (r − A)
,
A < r ≤ 1+β
β A
0
,
r > 1+β

,
where β is called the clipping depth factor.
C. Smooth Clipping technique
In [23], a Smooth Clipping (SC) technique is used to reduce
the OFDM PAPR. In this paper, the function based-clipping
for SC technique is deﬁned below and depicted in Fig. 1(c).
f (r) =

on Fig. 1 and have been completely studied and compared in
[18]. In the literature it exists other clipping function, among
them we may cite the invertible clipping [24].

D. Gaussian Clipping technique
In this subsection, we present the Gaussain Clipping (GC) for
PAPR reduction. We start from the Gaussian function, which
is drawn in Fig. 2. It will operate on the multicarrier signal
amplitudes in order to decrease its PAPR. In this context,
only positive values are taken into account, because the signal
modulus is always positive.
Fig. 2. Gaussian clipping function
The GC function f (.), associated to this Gaussian function,
is expressed as:
f (r) = Ae−(ηr)2,
r ≥ 0.
(7)
The parameters A and η control the performance of the method
(the transmitted mean power variation and the PAPR reduction
capability).
The GC technique whose expression is given in (7) can reduce
the OFDM PAPR by increasing low amplitudes samples and
by decreasing high amplitudes samples, as illustrated in Fig.
3.
Fig. 3 shows that for samples rn such that rn = |xn| ≤ S, the
signal is ampliﬁed whereas for samples rn such that rn ≥ S
the signal is attenuated. S, which corresponds to the threshold
between ampliﬁcation and reduction of the signal is obtained
by solving (8) and is given by (9):
f [r] = Ae−(ηr)2 = Ar,
(8)
what gives:
S =
s
W(2η)
2η
,
(9)
where W(.) is the Lambert function. It has to be noted from
(9) that S depends only on the η parameter of the GC (see (7)).
It is therefore clear that S and consequently η, drives the PAPR
reduction gain of the GC. We will now explain the inﬂuence
of A on the PAPR reduction gain. We remind that one of our
objectives is to keep constant the average power between the
input and the output of clipping. Therefore, we would like
to have Py = Px, where Px and Py are the average powers
before and after the PAPR mitigation technique respectively.
Considering (7), Py is given by (10):
Py =
∞
Z
0
f (r)2 px (r)dr = A2
∞
Z
0
e−2(ηr)2px (r)dr,
(10)
where px (r) is the probability density function (PDF) of the
considered signal envelope (here the OFDM signal).
Therefore, the ratio γ between Px and Py is expressed as
follows:
γ = Py
Px
= A2
Px
∞
Z
0
e−2(ηr)2px (r)dr.
(11)
As shown by (11), A and η inﬂuence the ratio γ. This means
that it is possible to tune the ratio γ thanks to parameter A
without modifying the PAPR reduction gain, for a given η. In
fact we showed that the PAPR reduction gain only depends
on η parameter.
The A parameter value which gives Py = Px is given by: (12)
A(opt) =
√Px
∞
R
0
e−2(ηr)2px (r)dr
 1
2 .
(12)
To sum up, we have shown that η drives the PAPR reduction
gain whereas A drives the average power variation for a given
η.

IV. THEORETICAL STUDY OF GAUSSIAN CLIPPING
In this section, we analyze theoretically the behavior of the
GC function. We ﬁrst focus on the average power variation
∆E = 10 log10 (γ) . Then, we study the PAPR CCDF at the
output of the GC function. We are interested in the PAPR
reduction gain ∆PAPR for a CCDF value of 10−2 before and
after clipping.

A. Average power variation analysis
As mentioned previously px (r) is PDF of the OFDM envelope
and can be assimilated to a Rayleigh distribution for a large
number of OFDM subcarriers. Its expression is given by:
px (r) = 2r
Px e− r2

r ≥ 0.

V. COMPARATIVE STUDY WITH OTHER CLIPPING
FUNCTIONS
In this subsection, GC performance are compared to classical
clipping (Section III-A), Deep clipping (Section III-B) and
Smooth clipping (Section III-C) performance. Although these
three baseline algorithms are not recent, they are most of
the time considered for PAPR reduction (especially hard and
smooth clipping) and associated with ﬁltering. This is the
reason why we took these three approaches as a comparison
basis.
This comparative study is performed in the context of the
WLAN standard IEEE 802.11 a/g, whose parameters are given
in Table I.

In Fig. 6 the PAPR reduction gain, ∆PAPR, is analyzed for
the four clipping techniques in function of the average power
variation ∆E. For the Classical, Deep and Smooth clipping
functions, ∆PAPR decreases with ∆E and becomes very small
for ∆E ≃ 0 dB. At the opposite, ∆PAPR with the GC is quasi
constant with ∆E. In fact, whatever the value of ∆E, ∆PAPR
of GC equals 5.2 dB. This result is the great advantage of
the GC, because it offers a PAPR reduction gain of 5.2 dB
without modifying the average power. To reach this result it
is necessary to set
A
√Px to 0.45 dB as shown in Fig. 7.
In this ﬁgure, the inﬂuence of the parameter A is presented.
The results show A controls the average power variation
without modifying the PAPR reduction gain. This result is
very important. In fact, it is possible to choose A in such a
way that Py = Px without modifying the PAPR reduction
gain. In other words, with the GC function it is possible to
reach a PAPR reduction gain of 5 dB with an average power
variation ∆E = 0.
Fig. 8 presents the BER performance. As expected, these
techniques degrade the BER. In fact the signal resulting from
clipping functions is useful for PAPR reduction but behaves
also as an interferer which deteriorates the signal both in
and out of band. Generally out of band degradation can
be removed by ﬁltering (it is why clipping techniques are
generally named clipping and ﬁltering techniques). GC is the
one which degrades the most the BER. This was expected
because the PAPR reduction was the highest. That means that
GC (as every clipping function) could not be used without
BER improvement. To mitigate the BER degradation due
to clipping noise (whatever the clipping function), several
techniques could be performed:
• by inverting the clipping function or by iterative substrac-
tion of the noise regenerated by the clipping function
at the receiver [10]. Iterative methods to substract the
estimated noise have been proposed in [11] and [12]. The
main drawbacks, in our point of view, are (i) these tech-
niques become no more downward compatible and (ii) the
complexity is high at the receiver side. Furthermore, the
out of band noise will degrade the signal in the adjacent
band (the so called shoulders), which is, of course, not
acceptable.
• another alternative consists in turning the clipping method
into a Tone Reservation (TR) method. By principle TR
does not deteriorated the BER. This technique has several
advantages: (i) it is performed at the transmitter side, (ii)
it is downward compatible and (iii) it is very simple to
set up. This approach is detailed in the following section.

VI. TONE RESERVATION BASED GAUSSIAN CLIPPING
A. Context of Tone Reservation
We are focusing here on one of the most common methods
called Tone Reservation (TR) [14], because it is able to
decrease the PAPR without degrading the BER. This method
has been standardized in DVB-T2. It consists in computing
a corrective signal (also, called peak-reducing signal) which
is inserted on a set of reserved tones. It is added to the
original signal, leading to a PAPR reduction of the latter.
The simplest way to generate and compute the corrective
signal is to deliberately clip the OFDM signal [13]. In this
paper we propose to use the GC function presented previously.
This function keeps constant the average power of the signal
which is of great importance in practice. Then, we insert this
corrective signal on the reserved tones by a suitable frequency
domain ﬁltering, as described in [8]. Thus, the resulting PAPR
reduction method is a fully downward compatible method
which does not degrade the useful signal.
B. Tone Reservation principle
The TR technique [14], [15] is an adding signal technique. It
has been studied mainly for the OFDM signal, without any
speciﬁcation of a standard.
The idea of the TR technique is to reserve Nr sub-carriers (also
called tones) in the OFDM symbol on which an appropriate
information will be added in order to change the time signal,
so as to reduce its dynamics. In this technique, the transmitter
and the receiver agree on the number and the positions of the
subcarriers which are reserved to carry the corrective signal
to decrease the PAPR.
In this paper, the TR technique will be implemented using
the “unused subcarriers”, so-called “null subcarriers”, that are
considered in the standards in order to make the technique
downward compatible. The diagram of the method is given in
Fig. 9.

The OFDM symbol represented by the vector X

In this paper, the discrete-time indexing [n] denotes Nyquist
Rate samples. Since oversampling may be needed in practical
designs, we will introduce the notation x [n/L] to denote
oversampling by L. Several different oversampling strategies
of x [n/L] can be deﬁned. From now on, the oversampled
IDFT output will refer to an oversampled of (2), which is
expressed as follows:

The PAPR of the signal x (t) may be deﬁned as
PAPR[x]

t∈[0,Ts] |x (t)|2
Px
,
(4)
where Px = E
{
|x (t)|2}
is the average signal power and
E {.} is the statistical expectation operator. Note that, in order
to accurately describe the PAPR, an oversampling factor L ≥
4 is required. In fact, the PAPR is practically computed in
the time analog domain and hence, to "see" the peaks with
samples, we need to oversample the signal with regard to the
symbol frequency.
In the literature, it is customary to use the Complementary
Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the PAPR as a
performance criterion. It is denoted as
CCDF[x] (ψ)
∆= Pr
{
PAPR[x] ≥ ψ
}
.
The principal idea of the TR technique is to reserve Nr
sub-carriers in the OFDM symbol on which appropriate in-
formation will be added in order to change the time signal,
so as to reduce the dynamics of the signal envelope. In this
technique, the transmitter and thereceiver agree on the number
and the positions of the subcarriers which are reserved to carry
the corrective signal to decrease the PAPR.
In this paper, the TR technique will be implemented using
the “unused subcarriers”, so-called “null subcarriers”,that are
considered in the standards in order to make the technique
backward compatible. The schematic diagram of the method
is given in Figure 1.

To build a new TR techniques, two problems should be
tackled, ﬁrst, we have to generate an adding signal cn and,
second, to insert it on the reserved tones. Of course, it is
possible to jointly solved these two problems. In the next
section, we present a possible way to generate this signal using
a clipping function. Then, in the Section II-D, we present an
easy way to insert the adding signal on the reserved tones
thanks to a frequency domain ﬁltering.

In [7], the peak-reducing signal cn is computed in the time

for PAPR reduction”. Using f (.) to reduce the PAPR of xn,
the peak reducing signal cn is written as

simple way to computing the desired peak-reducing signal,

III. GAUSSIAN CLIPPING
In this Section, we present brieﬂy the Gaussain Clipping
PAPR reduction, which is a new technique that has been f
described, initially, in [9] and submitted in [10]. This func
keeps constant the average power of the signal which i
great importance in practice.
In [6]; it is shown that all forms of clipping can
formulated as a signal adding technique for PAPR reduct
Gaussian Clipping is a technique for PAPR reduction (ﬁr
presented in [9]) in which a Gaussian function is used
change the behavior of the signal amplitude resulting in PA
reduction. This clipping function is presented in Figure 5
main advantage, compared to other clipping function, i
keep constant the average power of the signal before and a
clipping.
Gaussian Clipping can be viewed as a signal adding met
whose peak reducing signal cn is given in (7) and whose PA
reduction function f (.) is given by :
f (r) = Ae−(ηr)2,
r ≥ 0.
Parameters A and η control the performance of the met
(i.e.the transmitted mean power variation and the PAPR
duction capability). The Gaussian Clipping technique ba
on equation (9) can reduce the OFDM PAPR by increa
low-amplitudes samples and by decreasing high-amplitu
samples, as illustrated in Figure 5.
Figure 5 shows that for samples rn, such that rn = |xn
r(threshold), the signal is ampliﬁed, whereas for samples rn, s
that rn ≥ r(threshold) the signal is attenuated.
Fig. 10. Tone Reservation as an adding signal method
The peak-reducing signal cn is computed according to PAPR
reduction techniques. In [15], cn is computed based on Second
Order Cone Program (SOCP) in the frequency domain, while
in [26], cn is computed in the frequency domain with the
Gradient algorithm, which is a low-complexity algorithm. In
[13], the peak-reducing signal cn is computed in the time
domain based on a nonlinear function f (.) called “function
for PAPR reduction”. Using f (.) to reduce the PAPR of xn,
the peak reducing signal cn is written as
cn = f [|xn|] ejϕn − xn,
(24)
where ϕn is the phase of xn. In this paper, we use this simple
way to compute the desired peak-reducing signal, where f (.)
is the GC function.
D. Tone Reservation Filtering
Let ˜cn be the signal at the output of the FFT/IFFT block, as
shown in Fig. 11.
Fig. 11. Digital ﬁltering-based FFT/IFFT
The FFT/IFFT consists of a FFT followed by an IFFT. The
forward FFT transforms cn to the frequency-domain. The dis-
crete frequency components of cn on the reserved subcarriers
are passed unchanged, while the data subcarriers and the Out
Of Band (OOB) components are set to zero. The relationship
between the input and the output of the FFT/IFFT ﬁlter is
given by:
˜cn = F−1 (H [F (cn)]) ,
(25)
where F represents the FFT function, F−1 is the IFFT
function and H is the digital ﬁlter response in the frequency
domain. The FFT/IFFT ﬁlter complexity is approximated as
O (NL log2 NL). The principle of FFT/IFFT ﬁlter with a TR
technique is shown in Fig. 12.

In order to reduce the PAPR as much as possible, the algorithm
is based on an iterative procedure whose principle is as
follows:
• Set up the locations of the reserved subcarriers R and
the maximum iteration number Niter, and choose the
function for PAPR reduction f (.).
• Set up i = 0, where x(0)
n
= xn is the time-domain OFDM
signal.

VII. APPLICATION TO WLAN SYSTEMS
In the WLAN IEEE 802.11a/g standard, IFFT length N equals
64. Out of these 64 subcarriers, 48 subcarriers are used for
data, while 4 subcarriers are used for pilots. The remaining
12 subcarriers are unused (null) subcarriers located at the
positions R = {0, 27, · · · , 37} of the IFFT input.
Fig. 14. Spectral power mask of WLAN
The IEEE 802.11a/g standard speciﬁcations are given in [28]
and the transmit spectral mask requirements are shown in Fig.
14.
A. TR-GCF technique performance
In this section, we simulate the performance of the TR-GCF
(inﬂuence of η and Niter on the PAPR reduction and the Power
Spectral Density) in a WLAN (IEEE 802.11 a/g) context. Fig.
15 shows the inﬂuence of parameter η on the PAPR reduction
gain ∆PAPR. For η = 6, the maximum PAPR reduction gain
is achieved. In the rest of our simulations, η will be set to 6
in order to reach the maximum of PAPR reduction.
Fig. 15.
PAPR reduction performance of TR-GCF technique versus η for
Niter = 5
Fig. 16 shows the performance of PAPR reduction for different
iteration numbers. As expected, the PAPR reduction gain
increases with the number of iterations Niter. For example,
at 10−2 of the CCDF, ∆PAPR is about 1.10 dB, 1.65 dB,
1.77 dB and 1.80 dB for Niter = 1, 3, 5 and 10, respectively.
However, the PAPR reduction gain converges from Niter ≥ 5
because, in Fig. 16, there is no signiﬁcant reduction of PAPR
between Niter = 5 and Niter = 10.
The IEEE 802.11a/g standard speciﬁcations are given in
[18] and the transmit spectral mask requirements are shown
in Figure 7.
B. “TR-GCF” technique performance analysis
In this section, we simulate the performance of the “TR-
GCF” (inﬂuence of the η parameter and inﬂuence of the
number of iterations Niter on the PAPR reduction, Power
Spectral Density) in a WLAN (IEEE 802.11 a/g) context. The
Figure 8 shows the inﬂuence of parameter η on the PAPR
reduction gain ∆PAPR.
It shows that the PAPR reduction is sensitive to the param-
eter η and, for η = 6, the maximum PAPR reduction gain is
achieved. In the rest of our simulations, η will be set to 6 in
order to reach the maximum of PAPR reduction.

Fig. 17 presents the spectrum of WLAN signals before and
after applying the TR-GCF technique. It shows that whatever
the Niter value, the signal spectrum, after PAPR reduction,
meets the speciﬁcations of the WLAN standard transmission.
The power of the subcarriers (the unused ones which carried
out the Peak reducing signal) increases with Niter because the
power of the PAPR reduction signal increases with Niter. As
the PAPR reduction signal is carried by the unused subcarriers
(which are located besides the useful data of the IEEE 802.1a/g
standard), the power level of these subcarriers increases as seen
in Fig. 17. But the level of these carriers remains below the
WLAN spectral mask.

ever Niter value, the WLAN BER matches with the theoretical
BER, because the TR technique does not, inherently, degrate
the BER.
C. Comparative study of “TR-GCF” with “TR-GP” and “TR-
SOCP”
In this section, we compare the performance of the “TR-
GCF” technique, which we have proposed in this paper, with
those of the“TR-GP” and “TR-SOCP” techniques in a WLAN
context (based on IEEE 802.11 a/g). The TR techniques
for PAPR reduction “TR-SOCP” and “TR-GP” are deeply
described in [12] and [13] respectively.
Figure 12 compares the reduction in PAPR of the “TR-
GCF”, “TR-GP” and “TR-SOCP” techniques according to the
variation of the avarage power. It shows that, in terms of PAPR
reduction, the “TR-SOCP” is better (∼ 2 dB and ∼ 3 dB PAPR
reduction more than the“TR-GP” and “TR-GCF” techniques,
respectively). This result is explained by the fact that “TR-
SOCP” is an optimal TR technique in contrast to “TR-GP” and
Fig. 17. WLAN signals spectrum before and after TR-GCF PAPR technique
In Fig. 18, we verify that the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the
WLAN system after applying the TR-GCF technique matches
the theoretical BER. We can remark that, as expected, what-
ever Niter value, the WLAN BER matches with the theoretical
BER, because all of the tones used for TR are outside of the
useful band so do not interfere with the data.

VI. CONCLUSION
Tone Reservation based Gaussian Clipping has been pro-
posed in this paper. This new method has been obtained
thanks to a TR transformation of the adding signal resulting
of the Gaussian function clipping. Even the main advantage of
keeping constant the average power of the Gaussion Clipping
Function is partly lost due to the frequency domain ﬁltering of
the TR method, it is possible to control efﬁciently this average
power variation ∆E. In fact as A controls the average power
variation without affecting the PAPR reduction gain, a simple
constraint in the algorithm could control ∆E.
Performance of the TR-GCF has been evaluated through
simulations and compared to other signal adding techniques
that were TR transformed. The main conclusion is that the
“TR-GCF” technique is the best compromise between com-
plexity and performance for backward compatible techniques.

In this section, we compare the performance of the TR-GCF
technique, which proposed in this paper, with those of the
TR-GP and TR-SOCP techniques in a WLAN context. The
TR techniques for PAPR reduction TR-SOCP and TR-GP are
deeply described in [16] and [26] respectively.
Fig. 19 compares the reduction in PAPR of the TR-GCF, TR-
GP and TR-SOCP techniques according to the variation of the
average power. It shows that, in terms of PAPR reduction, the
TR-SOCP is better (∼ 2 dB and ∼ 3 dB of PAPR reduction
more than the TR-GP and TR-GCF techniques, respectively).
This result is explained by the fact that TR-SOCP is an optimal
TR technique in contrast to TR-GP and TR-GCF techniques
which are sub-optimal TR techniques.
The major drawback of TR-SOCP technique lies in its com-
plexity (estimated to O
