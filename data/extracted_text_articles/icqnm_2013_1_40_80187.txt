Abstract— In this paper, the interaction between bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) and water soluble CdTe quantum dots (QDs) 
modified with different ligands (3-mercaptoacetic acid, 
thioglycolic acid and glutathione) was studied using the 
fluorescence spectroscopy. It was found that the presence of 
QDs led to a strong quenching effect of BSA, which could be 
explained by a covalent interaction between the protein and 
the quencher, demonstrating the formation of QDs-BSA 
bioconjugates.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Semiconductor nanocrystals, also known as quantum 
dots (QDs), are nano-scaled inorganic particles in the size 
range of 1–10 nm [1]. Due to their quantum confinement, 
QDs show unique and fascinating optical properties, such as 
sharp and symmetrical emission spectra, high quantum yield 
(QY), good chemical and photo-stability and size dependent 
emission [2]. So far, QDs have been linked with bio-
recognition molecules such as proteins, peptides and nucleic 
acids, and have been successfully used in biological and 
medical fields such as immunoassay, DNA hybridization, 
cell imaging and potential photodynamic therapy [3]. In 
general, reported QD bioconjugation approaches are mainly 
based on bifunctional linkage (such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-
dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydro-chloride, EDC 
hydro-chloride), electrostatic attraction, and biotin–avidin 
interaction. However, no matter what conjugation approach 
is used, QDs bioconjugates need to be purified and 
characterized. The adsorption of protein molecules on 
nanoparticles 
(NPs) 
surface 
changes 
their 
surface 
functionality, which influences their behavior in biological 
systems. Moreover, the formation of NP–protein conjugates 
provides NPs stability over the broad range of pH and ionic 
strengths. Smaller NPs favor native-like protein structure 
more strongly, whereas larger NPs provide larger surface 
area of contact for adsorbed proteins resulting in stronger 
interactions between proteins and NPs [4]. The efficiency of 
this interaction can be a decisive factor for the fate of a NP 
within the biological system. But at the same time, the 
interaction between QDs bioconjugation is of great 
importance in biological applications [5].  
BSA has been one of the most extensively studied 
proteins, particularly because of its structural homology with 
human serum albumin. It was often used as coating reagent 
to modify the surface of NPs due to its strong affinity to the 
variety of NPs, such as gold NPs, silica NPs, and QDs. 
Serum albumins play an important role in the transport of 
many 
exogenous 
and 
endogenous 
ligands, 
binding 
covalently and reversibly to these ligands and increasing the 
tumor selectivity of the ligands by enhanced permeation and 
retention effect. Up to now, QDs modified by BSA have 
been applied as ion sensors, fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer, and chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. 
Moreover, due to the increasing extension of nanotechnology 
in biological sciences, it is imperative to develop a detailed 
understanding how biological entities, especially proteins, 
may interact with nanoscale particles [6].  
In this paper, the interaction between bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) and water soluble CdTe quantum dots 
modified with different ligands (3-mercatoacetic acid, 
thioglycolic acid and glutathione) was studied using 
fluorescence spectroscopy. It was found that the presence of 
QDs led to a strong quenching of fluorescence emission, 
which could be explained by covalent interaction between 
the protein and the quencher, demonstrating the formation of 
QDs-BSA bioconjugates [7]. 
This paper is structured as follows: Section I describes 
properties of QDs and their bioconjugation approach. 
Section II represents the synthesis of water soluble CdTe 
QDs modified with different ligands (3-mercatoacetic acid, 
thioglycolic acid and glutathione) and their bioconjugation 
with BSA. The interaction between BSA and CdTe QDs is 
discussed in Section III, Section IV concludes the paper.

MATERIAL AND METHOD 
A. Chemicals  
All chemicals were purchased by Sigma Aldrich (Czech 
Republic) in ACS purity unless otherwise stated. Aqueous 
solutions were prepared using MilliQ water. 
B. Synthesis of CdTe QDs 
The procedure for synthesis of glutathione (GSH)-capped 
CdTe QDs was adapted from the work of Duan et al. [8] with 
slight modifications. The synthesis of 3-mercaptopropionic 
acid (MPA)-capped CdTe QDs and thioglycolic acid (TGA)-
capped CdTe QDs were adapted from the work of Wang et 
al. [9]. Sodium telluride was used as Te source. Due to the

fact that sodium telluride is air stable, all of the operations 
were performed in the air avoiding the need for inert 
atmosphere. The synthesis of CdTe QDs and their 
subsequent coating were as follows: 114 mg of the CdCl2.2.5 
H2O was diluted with 25 mL of water. During the constant 
stirring, 65 μL MPA (56 μl TGA or 150 mg GSH), 25 mg of 
sodium citrate, 2 mL of Na2TeO3 solution (c = 0.01 mol/L), 
and 10 mg of NaBH4 were added into cadmium(II) aqueous 
solution. 1 M NaOH was then used to adjust the pH to 10 
under vigorous stirring. The mixture was kept at 95 °C under 
the reflux cooling for 3 hours. 
C. Bioconjugation of CdTe QDs 
1) Electrostatic attraction 
BSA can easily conjugate with CdTe QDs by 
electrostatic attraction. 250 μL of QDs were added to a 
mixture of 137.5 μL BSA and 92.5 μL phosphate buffered 
saline (0.01 M, pH 7.4), and the solution stood at room 
temperature for 2 h. The reaction solution was stored in the 
refrigerator at 4 °C [10]. The final concentration of QDs was 
set to 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 5 mg/mL and final concentration of 
BSA was calculated to be 15 mg/mL. 
2) Covalent conjugation 
For the conjugation of BSA with CdTe QDs (final 
concentration 0; 0.5; 1; 1.5; 2 and 5 mg/mL), 100 µL of 
0.05 M EDC and 100 µL of 5 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide 
(NHS) were added to 500 µL of QDs redispersed in 20 mM 
phosphate buffer (PB) of pH 7.4 and incubated at 32 ºC for 
30 min under slight shaking conditions. 200 μL of BSA in 20 
mM PB were added to the reaction mixture and further 
incubated at 32 ºC for 3 h under slight shaking conditions. 
The solution was kept at 4 ºC overnight to deactivate the 
remaining EDC-NHS. The unbound protein was removed by 
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min [11]. The final 
concentration of QDs was set to 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 5 
mg/mL and the final concentration of BSA was calculated to 
be 15 mg/mL. 
D. Characterization of CdTe QDs  
Photoluminescence spectra were measured at room 
temperature with Fluorolog, HORIBA Jobin Yvon and 
quantum yield was calculated with Quanta φ, HORIBA 
Jobin Yvon.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. CdTe QDs characterization 
To investigate the behavior of QDs in the presence of 
BSA, water soluble CdTe QDs were synthesized. We 
selected three kinds of mercaptan ligands such as MPA, 
TGA, GSH for the preparation of QDs. The emission spectra 
of typical CdTe QDs used in this study were measured at 
excitation wavelength of 380 nm. The emission spectrum is 
displayed by one emission peak at 620 nm in the case of 
MPA-capped CdTe QDs, one peak at 506 nm in the case of 
GSH-capped CdTe QDs and one peak at 540 nm in the case 
TGA-capped CdTe QDs. All peaks in characterized spectra 
showed a good symmetry and a narrow spectral width (see 
Figure 1). The quantum yield of CdTe QDs was evaluated to 
be 11.5 % in the case of CdTe-MPA, 16.5 % in the case of 
CdTe-GSH and 7% for CdTe-TGA.

TGA. 
B. The effect of QDs on BSA fluorescence  spectra  
Fluorescence (FL) quenching efficiency and the aspect 
of quenching mechanism of the BSA by QDs were studied 
by FL spectroscopy. CdTe QDs were prepared in aqueous 
phase using MPA, GSH or TGA as a stabilizer, resulting in 
the linkage of the thiol groups to the surface of CdTe QDs 
by SH-Cd coordination, while the functional carboxylic 
group is free, which can be easily coupled to biomolecules 
with amino groups, such as proteins, peptides or amino 
acids. BSA absorption spectrum shows absorption peak in 
UV region at 280 nm, and FL peak at 328 nm. It was found 
that the emission of CdTe QDs decreases progressively with 
increasing concentration of BSA.  
1) Electrostatic attraction 
The fluorescence intensity of BSA was quenched 
accompanied by a slight blue shift of the maximum 
emission wavelength with increasing concentration of CdTe 
QDs as can be seen in Figure 2 – Figure 4. These figures 
represent the emission spectra of MPA-QDs conjugation 
(GSH-QDs, TGA-QDs, respectively) with BSA via 
electrostatic interaction. The blue shift here indicated that 
tryptophan residue (BSA component) was in more 
hydrophobic environment due to the tertiary structural 
change of albumin. The intrinsic reason for this change 
might lie in the more flexible conformation of albumin 
adsorbed on the NPs surface, which favored the access of 
tryptophan residues to the bulk surface of QDs [12]. The FL 
quenching is known to occur due to excited state reactions, 
energy transfer, collisional quenching (dynamic quenching) 
and complex formation (static quenching). The last two 
processes are mainly considered. Both dynamic quenching 
and static quenching reveal the connection of linearity 
between relative FL intensity (F0/F) and QDs concentration 
[13]. The quenching of BSA FL by QDs can be described by 
Stern-Volmer equation:

where F0 and F are FL intensity of BSA in the absence and 
presence of QDs, respectively, [Q] is QDs concentration and 
KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. The F0/F ratios 
were calculated and plotted against quencher concentration 
according to (1). After linear fit, KSV were calculated from 
the slope of the plots [14]. The results show that the 
quenching constant KSV is variant with different type of 
QDs and the higher KSV is, the higher is the quenching 
effect [15]. The FL intensity decreased more significantly in 
the case of BSA-QDs than in the case of MPA-QDs or 
TGA-QDs. The ratios of MPA-QDs bonded with BSA 
exhibited a quite good linearity with determination 
coefficient R2 of 0.9782 (see Figure 5). The Stern-Volmer 
plot of GSH-QDs quenching properties exhibited linear 
trend with coefficient of determination R2 to be 0.9953 and 
in the case of TGA-QDs the coefficient of determination R2 
was 0.8717. The results suggest that QDs can effectively 
quench the FL of BSA in a ligand dependent manner.

These results indicated that QDs can effectively quench 
the FL of BSA in a ligand-dependent manner. Structurally, 
this is due to the presence of NH2 and COOH groups in the 
QDs capping agent, namely MPA (1 × COOH group); GSH 
(3 × NH2 and 2 × COOH groups) and TGA (1 × COOH 
group). Therefore hydrogen bonds can be easily formed 
between GSH-QDs and BSA. In other words, the number of 
amino-groups can strongly influence the interactions 
between BSA and QDs capped with GSH. Therefore, the 
order of interactions between BSA and QDs is as follows: 
TGA-QDs < MPA-QDs < GSH-QDs.  
2) Covalent conjugation  
In the case of QDs covalently bonded with BSA, EDC 
and NHS were used as coupling agents. Figure 6 – Figure 8 
represent the emission spectra of BSA with various 
concentrations of MPA-QDs, GSH-QDs and TGA-QDs. 
The FL intensity was quenched by the addition of various 
types of QDs (the most significantly in the case of GSH-
QDs) with BSA concentration of 15 mg/mL.

Figure 8.  Emission spectra of BSA capped with TGA-CdTe QDs via

The results suggest the interaction between BSA and 
QDs occurs and the quenching effect of QDs on the FL 
emission of BSA is found to be concentration dependent, 
thus QDs can bind to the BSA. In the case of MPA-QDs 
bonded with BSA, results exhibited a very good linearity 
with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.9998 (see Figure 
9). The Stern-Volmer plot of GSH-QDs quenching 
properties exhibited linear trend with coefficient of 
determination R2 to be 0.9965 and in the case of TGA-QDs 
the coefficient of determination R2 was 0.9904. This 
behavior suggests that only statistic quenching is taking 
place. The highest K   constant was observed in the case of 
GSH-QDs, which is due to the presence of higher number of 
NH2 groups in GSH (3 groups) compared to MPA and 
TGA. The KSV constants of BSA covalently bonded to QDs 
are much higher compared to the electrostatic interactions 
between QDs and BSA.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Water soluble CdTe QDs modified with different ligands 
(MPA, TGA and GSH) were prepared by a simple one step 
method using Na2TeO3 and CdCl2. The emission spectra 
display that the emission peak lies at 620 nm in the case of 
MPA-capped CdTe QDs, at 506 nm in the case of GSH-
capped CdTe QDs and at 540 nm in the case of TGA-
capped CdTe QDs. In the next stage, QDs were covalently 
and electrostatically conjugated to BSA. It was found that 
the presence of QDs led to a strong quenching of the FL 
emission, which could be explained by a covalent 
interaction between the protein and the quencher, 
demonstrating the formation of QDs-BSA bioconjugates.
