Abstract—IEEE 802.11ah is an emerging wireless local area
network standard at sub 1 GHz license-exempt bands for cost-
effective and large-scale wireless networks. One of the most
challenging issues in IEEE 802.11ah is supporting a large number
of stations efﬁciently. To reduce heavy channel contention in IEEE
802.11ah networks, stations are divided into groups and each
group of stations are allowed to access in only the designated
channel access period. This grouping strategy enables fair channel
access among a large number of stations. However, grouping
strategy cannot improve channel usage efﬁciency at the time
of network initialization. Therefore, during association, heavy
contention results in longer association delay. Also, already asso-
ciated stations can contend for data transmission. In this paper,
authentication/association process is analyzed. Our analysis shows
that the association process may take up to several minutes.
Therefore, there is a need for a new mechanism to avoid collisions
of authentication requests and trafﬁc from already associated
stations.

INTRODUCTION
The wide use of IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks
in indoor and outdoor applications has crowded 2.4/5 GHz
frequency bands. New technologies like smart grid applica-
tions, internet of things (IoT), and Machine-to-Machine(M2M)
communication will further saturate the spectrum if same 2.4
GHz/5 GHz are used. IEEE 802.11ah Task Group (TGah) is
working on new WiFi standard to design a sub 1 GHz protocol
which will allow up to 8191 devices attached to a single
access point (AP) to get access for short-data transmissions [1].
IEEE 802.11ah wireless LAN standard group targets to support
sensor networks, backhaul communications of sensor/meter
data, and possibly M2M communications [2].
In IEEE 802.11ah network, thousands of stations are con-
nected with a single AP. As the number of station increases,
the network throughput and delay performances can be rapidly
deteriorated due to the serious channel contention. While
the contention becomes serious as the number of stations
increases, one method to solve the problem is to limit the
number of contending stations at a time by grouping. Same
idea is adopted by IEEE 802.11ah. IEEE 802.11ah introduces a
new mechanism, called restrict access window (RAW). One or
more RAWs can be allocated in a beacon interval (BI) and only
designated stations can access the channel in a RAW using the
prevalent distributed coordination function (DCF) or enhanced
distributed channel access (EDCA) [3][4]. Moreover, a RAW
can be further divided into RAW slots, and they are allocated to
different stations. Thus, IEEE 802.11ah can provide two-level
grouping to alleviate the contention in a dense network [4].
It is expected that the RAW strategy can improve the channel
access efﬁciency in a dense network.
IEEE 802.11ah is mainly designed for low data trafﬁc, thus,
even the large number of stations can be fairly serviced by
RAW. RAW performs only after the stations are associated.
Thus, even though RAW limits the number of associated
stations contending for the channel, it cannot improve channel
usage efﬁciency at the stage of network initialization. The main
contribution of this paper is to emphasize the need of a new
method to handle data and association trafﬁc simultaneously in
IEEE 802.11ah. A network can reset due to various reasons,
such as power failure, AP reboot, system crash, and so on.
Once AP restarts, stations try to associate. Therefore, during
the network initialization, how to avoid collisions of authenti-
cation requests and trafﬁc of already associated stations is a big
question [5]. To demonstrate our point, an analytical model of
the authentication/association process is developed to analyze
and evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11ah networks.
Since it may take up to several minutes for all stations to get
associated, the obtained results clearly indicate that the trafﬁc
from stations contending for network association can collide
with the trafﬁc from stations contending for data transmission.
Therefore, a new method to handle data and association trafﬁc
is necessary.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
shows the overview and main features of IEEE 802.11ah.
Section III discusses the the obtained experimental results.
Finally, we conclude the paper in Section IV.

OVERVIEW OF IEEE 802.11AH
A. IEEE 802.11ah Features
IEEE 802.11ah is designed for supporting applications with
the following requirements: up to 8191 devices associated to
an AP, having the mechanism for power saving strategies,
minimum network data rate of 100 kbps, operating carrier
frequencies bands below 1 GHz with coverage up to 1 km
in outdoor areas, and short and infrequent data transmissions
[1]. One of the goals of the IEEE 802.11ah TGah is to offer a
standard that, apart from satisfying these previously mentioned
requirements, minimizes the changes with respect to the widely
adopted IEEE 802.11.
IEEE 802.11ah uses orthogonal frequency division multi-
plexing (OFDM) on the physical layer (PHY) operating in the
license-exempt bands below 1 GHz. IEEE 802.11ah maintains

the similar network architecture with the 802.11. The most
popular applications of IEEE 802.11ah are in sensors and
meters which consist of a huge number of battery powered
stations.
B. Restricted Access Window (RAW)
Figure 1 shows the superframe structure of IEEE 802.11ah.
In order to provide the service to large number of stations,
IEEE 802.11ah introduces RAW. The RAW mechanism en-
ables fair channel access among the large number of stations.
Right after the beacon period (BP), there could be hundreds
or thousands of stations trying to access the medium for data
transmission. RAW mechanism restricts channel access to a
small number of stations at a given time and distributes their
access attempts over a much longer period of time. In this
mechanism, the AP allocates a medium access period in the
BI, called RAW, which is divided into several time slots of
Tslot duration each as shown in Figure 1. The AP may assign
a time slot inside the RAW to a group of stations during which
only those certain stations are allowed to contend for medium
access. RAW allocation information is broadcast in a beacon
to notify whether a station is allowed to use RAW interval or
not. The allocation information in the beacon also includes
the start time and the duration of the RAW (TRAW ). If a
station is allowed to access the channel within the RAW, it
may contend for medium access at the start of its assigned
time slot. However, stations should stop attempting to access
the medium as soon as their assigned time slot is ﬁnished. It
should be noted that there may be some stations, which are
not allowed to use the RAW. During the channel time assigned
to others, a station can go to sleep to save energy.
There is a parameter called cross slot boundary encapsu-
lated in the beacon that deﬁnes the behavior of the RAW [4].
If the cross slot boundary is allowed, uplink transmissions can
cross the boundary of the allocated time slot. However, if it is
not allowed, then the stations try to access the medium only
if the remaining time in the allocated slot boundary is enough
to complete the transmission.
C. Association in IEEE 802.11ah
Stations can use RAW only after they are associated. Even
though RAW limits the number of stations contending for the
channel, it cannot be used at the stage of network initialization.
Thus, IEEE 802.11ah has developed an authentication control
mechanisms for limiting the contention that works as follows.
In every beacon, Authentication Control Threshold (ACT) is
selected according to some implementation dependent rules
[2]. The AP may change this ACT dynamically. When a
station is initialized, it shall generate an authentication control
number randomly from the interval [0, L]. Having received a
beacon, the station tries to associate with the AP only if its
station

AP

Ack
Ack

authentication control number is less than the received ACT.
Otherwise, it shall postpone association till the next BI. To
avoid unfairness in the future, the station may regenerate its
random number after authentication is ﬁnished.
Figure 2 shows the association process. If a station is
eligible for the association, it starts the association process.
The association procedure starts by sending the authentication
request to AP. After the station is authenticated, AP responses
with authentication response frame and is acknowledged by
the station. Once the station is authenticated, it will send an
association request to the AP. The association request contains
chosen encryption types if required and other compatible
802.11 capabilities. If the elements in the association request
match with the capabilities of the AP, the AP will create
an association ID (AID) for the station and respond with an
association response message granting network access to the
station. The association response is again acknowledged by
the station. Once a station is associated with AP, it can start
communication.
D. Co-existence of Data and Association Frames
As mentioned above, during association ACT is used,
whereas RAW is used for data communication. Even though
both ACT and RAW are used to limit the number of contending
stations, they come into the picture at different network stages.
However, they may co-exist during network initialization stage.
During network initialization, there will be two types of
stations, one using ACT and another using RAW. However,
how these two type of stations co-exist and how to manage
the trafﬁc from these two types of stations are unanswered in
the draft of 802.11ah. An open issue is how to avoid collisions
of authentication requests and trafﬁc of already associated
stations. So, these questions can be topics for future research.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
A. Experimental Setup
The overall purpose of our study is to see how long stations
spend for association in a large network. The transmission
behavior of the devices in IEEE 802.11ah can be approximated
by that of IEEE 802.11 stations [6]. Therefore, the default
implementation of IEEE 802.11 that is readily available in ns-2
is used to study the behavior of IEEE 802.11ah. The problem in
ns-2 is that it cannot simulate thousands of stations. However,
IEEE 802.11ah implements authentication control mechanism

that allows only limited number of stations to contend for
channel access at a time. Therefore, even though we are
assuming a large network with N stations, we assume only
g stations are active at a time. All simulations are performed
under ns-2.34. Table I depicts the parameters used for the
simulation. An AP is deployed at the center of the network.
All stations try to associate with the AP. Once the stations are
associated, they stay idle. To simulate the behavior of IEEE
802.11ah, in our simulation we varied the number of stations
from 10 to 50 and evaluated the average time taken by each
station for the association. From the trace ﬁle, we ﬁrst obtained
the total time taken for association by all stations. Then, the
average time is calculated by dividing total time by the number
of stations. Table II shows the average time (ATasso) taken
by (g) stations for successfully getting associated with AP.
Note that average association time do not depend on BI and
is always ﬁxed for g stations in a network [4]-[9].
Once the average time taken by a station is known, the
total time spent for association by N stations can be easily
calculated. Out of g contending stations, the total number of
stations, nbi, that can be successfully associated in a BI is given
by
nbi = BI − BP
ATasso
.
(1)
If nbi ≥ g, then all g stations can be successfully associated
in a BI and remaining duration of BI is unused. Also, the next
g stations have to wait until the next BI. Therefore, the total
time (TTasso) required by N stations for the association can
be obtained as

are varied. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that changing the
number of active stations changes the association time for a
given BI. Also, it can be seen from the ﬁgure that for any
given BI, there exist a number that gives the least association
time. For example, for BI=0.2, 15 active stations gave the least
association time whereas, for BI=0.8, 25 stations gave the least
association time. Therefore, authentication control mechanism
should limit the number of active stations to the optimum
number that gives the least association time. The important
observation from the ﬁgure is that for a given BI, there is
an optimum number of active stations that gives the lowest
association time.

CONCLUSION
IEEE 802.11ah has introduced RAW strategy to address
heavy channel contention for large network size. However,
RAW cannot improve channel access at the stage of network
initialization. Therefore, in the case of network reset or during
network initialization, every station tries for association and
network suffer from heavy contention. In this paper, the asso-
ciation process of IEEE 802.11ah is analyzed. Our analysis and
results demonstrate that during network reset, stations experi-
ence heavy contention and long association delay. Also during
network initialization phase, there exist two types of stations.
One which are already associated (using RAW) and the another
that are trying to get associated (not using RAW). However, no
mechanism has been proposed in the draft of IEEE 802.11ah to
handle the collision of authentication requests and trafﬁc from
already associated stations. Minimizing the association time
as lower as possible can reduce the collision to some extend.
However, a new mechanism to avoid collision of frames from
above mentioned two different types of stations is necessary.
Our analysis and results show that here is an optimum
number of active stations for a BI that gives the least associa-
tion delay. This motivates future work to develop an efﬁcient
algorithm that calculates an optimum number of active stations
for a BI and used that number for minimizing the association
delay.
