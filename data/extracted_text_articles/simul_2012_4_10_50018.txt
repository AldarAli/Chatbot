Abstract— Global population aging is creating an immense 
pressure on healthcare facilities making them unable to cope 
with the growing demand for elderly healthcare services. 
Current demand-supply gaps result in prolonged waiting times 
for patients and substantial cost burdens for healthcare 
systems due to delayed discharges. This paper describes a 
project aimed at presenting modeling and simulation to 
address elderly care pathways within the Irish healthcare 
sector. The management of frail patients admitted to acute 
hospitals and the introduction of the new intermediate care 
beds are alternative interventions that healthcare executives 
are interested in simulating to examine their impact on the 
performance of the elderly care system. The developed 
simulation model, along with the statistical analysis, have 
enabled the management to assess the current system under 
the critical financial and performance issues. It also highlights 
the decision variables that significantly improve the flow of 
elderly patients.

 INTRODUCTION 
Advances in pharmaceutical and medical technology 
during the past century have caused a major shift in global 
demographics 
by 
increasing 
life 
expectancy 
to 
unprecedented figures. The result is that there are more 
elderly people today than ever before [1]. Furthermore, the 
world’s elderly population is expected to grow from 650 
million to 2 billion people by 2050 [2]. In Europe, there are 
currently 108 million elderly people who constitute 15% of 
the European population, and this figure is forecasted to 
increase to 26% by 2050 [3]. A similar trend is expected in 
Ireland where the elderly population is projected to grow 
from 500,000 to 1.3 million over the next 30 years [4]. 
Although elderly patients represent 11% of the Irish 
population, they account for up to 50% of hospital bed usage  
[4]. Consequently, pressures are now on Irish hospitals, not 
only due to the increase in demand for acute hospital beds, 
but also because elderly patients use acute hospital resources 
disproportionately. In response to such demographic 
changes, hospitals in Ireland are striving to fill the existing 
supply-demand gap while maintaining their quality of 
service [4]. Global economic crisis implied a severe cut in 
healthcare funds and elicited a limited resource policy in 
hospitals and other healthcare services. This caused Irish 
hospitals and elderly healthcare facilities to equally face a 
grave capacity planning issue to respond to the increased 
demand. 
The subsequent shortage of beds has numerous facets 
that impact adversely on the overall performance of the Irish 
healthcare system. Firstly, it has a significant impingement to 
Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding, a problem that 
has detrimental consequences including higher mortality 
rates for elderly patients [5]. Secondly, shortage of 
community care beds leads to delayed discharges from acute 
hospitals, which not only delays new admissions into 
hospitals, but also burdens hospitals with high unjustified 
costs since acute beds are considered among the most 
expensive resources of the entire healthcare system [6]. 
Finally, delays due to the lack of short-term and long-term 
bed supply create substantial waiting times in most stages of 
the healthcare system. Long waiting times in elderly care 
services, as well as other services, are the most frequent 
complaints reported by patients to healthcare executives 
every year [4]. 
Simulation models have been proven to be an excellent 
and flexible tool for modeling processes in such stochastic 
complex environments [7]. Healthcare managers can apply 
simulation for assessing current performance, predicting the 
impact of operational changes, and examining the tradeoffs 
between system variables [8]. Furthermore, areas of 
improvement can be identified using simulation models 
through possible reorganization and allocation of existing 
resources [9][10]. On a micro-level, simulation is well-suited 
to tackle problems in hospital departments such as 
emergency departments [11][12] and operating rooms [13], 
where resources are scarce and patients arrive at irregular 
times [14]. Various alternatives and interventions can be 
evaluated and tested effectively [15]. A more accurate 
interpretation of the utilization of hospital resources can be 
envisaged using dynamic capabilities of simulation [16], 
which in turn supports the hospital management in their 
decisions on bed usage and patient flow [17]. This can be 
achieved by modeling the flow of patients through the 
hospital [18] then using scenarios to illustrate the 
consequences of possible potential decisions suggested by 
hospital management [19]. 
This paper presents a project implemented to support 
Irish health executives when decisions are to be made 
regarding  elderly care in the Irish system. The developed 
framework enables the directors to examine the dynamics 
embedded in the system through the modeling of patients’ 
care pathways. The model also highlights the high level of 
variability within patients demand and limitations of 
available resources within healthcare facilities. It aims to 
provide a comprehensive capacity-planning tool that can be

used to assess proposed strategies to handle the existing 
bottlenecks and improve the overall experience of elderly 
patients. The underlying objective of this project is to 
introduce a tool that will contribute into significant 
improvements in elderly patient service by increasing 
throughput and reducing waiting times and operations costs.  
The paper begins by introducing the conceptual model 
depicting the elderly patient journey within the healthcare 
system and the different discharge destinations. The 
development phases of the simulation model are then 
presented starting by data collection, coding, then validation. 
Using the model, two scenarios proposed by healthcare 
policy makers to improve patient flow are then examined 
followed by a design of experiment and statistical analysis to 
determine the most significant factors that affect patient flow 
and the magnitudes of their impact. Finally, the paper’s 
findings are reported along with recommendations for future 
work.  
II. 
PROBLEM CONTEXTUALIZATION 
A. Background 
Elderly patients are usually defined as those who are 
aged 65 and older and this convention is used in this study 
[20]. The most challenging of elderly patients are those 
referred to as frail. Frailty is characterized by suffering from 
an array of medical conditions that individually may be 
curable, but collectively create an overwhelming and 
complex burden of disease [1]. Frail patients constitute 18-
20% of the Irish elderly population and usually require 
treatment for an extended period of time in the healthcare 
facility followed by rehabilitation and/or community care. 
Adhering to the length of stay (LOS)-based cut-off point, 
frail patients were characterized in this study by a treatment 
period of more than 15 days in the acute system (i.e., 
hospitals). The remaining 80 - 82% of elderly patients who 
receive treatment for less than 15 days are referred to as non-
frail. 
The initial scope of this study focused solely on frail 
patients, however, since all 65+ patients utilize the same 
resources, it was imperative to widen the project’s scope to 
encompass all 65+ elderly patients, both frail and non-frail. 
Although elderly patients utilize a wide range of resources, 
the initial phase of the proposed model gives special 
attention to bed capacity within healthcare facilities based on 
a request from healthcare executives. Accordingly, elderly 
care services that do not necessitate admission, such as 
outpatient clinics, are excluded from the model because they 
do not affect hospital bed utilization. 
B. Conceptualization 
The journey of an elderly patient usually begins with 
their arrival at the ED by ambulance, walk-in or a referral by 
a General Practitioner (GP). After admission, elderly patients 
receive treatment in an acute bed until their care pathway is 
assigned subject to their diagnosis and frailty level. The 
duration of this process ranges from few days to two weeks 
for non-frail patients, but usually exceeds 45 days for frail 
patients.  
Following their stay in acute beds, elderly patients are 
discharged to one of the following destinations: 
Another Hospital: Certain medical procedures may 
require equipment that is not available in the acute hospital 
to which an elderly patient has been admitted. In such a case, 
elderly patients are transferred to another hospital where the 
required technology is available to undertake the procedure 
they need. Discharge figures to another hospital (6% of all 
elderly patients) include patients being moved to undergo a 
certain procedure, and patients who have received such a 
procedure and are returning to their original hospital. 
Rehabilitation: Patients who are deemed to be in a frail 
status but have the potential to improve their functional 
independence are discharged to an on-site or off-site facility 
where they receive rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is an 
intermediate destination in which frail patients are no longer 
categorized as acutely ill, but still need close medical 
observation with hope that they would recover [21]. After 
rehabilitation, the majority of patients (80%) are discharged 
home and the remaining 20% who have not recovered are 
discharged to long term care.  
Convalescence: Around 10% of non-frail patients are 
usually discharged to a convalescent care facility for a short 
stay during which they would recover from a medical 
procedure. Compared to rehabilitation, convalescence offers 
less intensive care as it prepares patients to go home. In 
several cases, convalescence may take place within a nursing 
home facility on dedicated short stay beds. 
Long Term Care (LTC): More than a quarter of frail 
elderly patients would not be able to live alone at their 
homes because they are unable to care for themselves or 
sometimes require perpetual medical supervision. They are 
discharged to a public or private nursing home to receive 
LTC and usually stay there for years until they die. This 
prolonged stay in nursing homes hampers the supply of LTC 
beds into the healthcare system resulting in waiting times 
that amount to several months. In addition to hospital 
demand, there is also a community demand in which frail 
patients apply for LTC and wait in their homes until they are 
placed in a nursing home. 
Home: The vast majority of non-frail elderly patients are 
eventually discharged to their homes, whether directly or 
after a short stay in convalescence. On the other hand, 24% 
of frail patients are directly discharged to their homes 
followed by another 28% that go home after rehabilitation. 
More than half of frail patients continue to require medical 
care within their own homes and thus are provided Home 
Care Packages (HCP). A HCP comprises a set of services 
provided by the state that may include home help, nursing, 
physiotherapy, occupational therapy and other services [4]. 
Consequently, shortages in rehabilitation, convalescence, 
LTC and HCP capacity are the main reasons behind delayed 
discharges from acute hospitals. Elderly patients occupy 
acute beds for an extended LOS that exceeds their treatment 
period not because they require acute health services, but 
because they are waiting to be discharged [22]. The 
alternative care pathways and their required bed resources 
are illustrated in Figure 1. The percentages of patients 
discharged to each destination are then listed in Table 1.

In addition to the previous discharge destinations, 6% 
of elderly patients may die during their acute stay, with the 
probability of mortality increasing proportionally with the 
frailty level. Another minimal number of patients (almost 
1%) who have special conditions are discharged to 
destinations referred to as “other” such as a prison or 
psychiatric facility.  
III. 
SIMULATION MODEL 
A. Data Collection 
Data quality and precision determines the validity of 
the simulation model. Hence, the data collection phase 
represents a critical milestone of any simulation project.  
Historical admission and discharge data was collected 
from the central healthcare information system, while bed 
capacities and LOS data were gathered through surveys. 
Similar to other healthcare modeling projects, collection of 
relevant modeling data presented considerable challenges 
[23]. The first was the dearth of data about certain 
parameters that were not captured by the central 
information system. It is worthy to note that a similar 
project undertaken in the UK to study elderly care diverted 
its objective from producing quantitative results to only 
building a simulation model due to the lack of relevant 
data [21]. The second challenge was data provided in 
aggregate figures while modeling inputs required them to 
be broken down into their individual elements. An 
example was the combination of the numbers of patients 
discharged to multiple destinations into one numerical 
figure. The third problem with data was inconsistencies 
found between different data sources such as variations in 
figures between hospital data and annual reports. After 
numerous extensive meetings with hospital officials, the 
absence of certain data and lack of information on how to 
decompose aggregated figures were overcome by the use 
of assumptions based on the opinions of experts in the 
field [24]. By gaining a deeper understanding of what each 
figure reflected, in most cases misunderstandings of 
terminology or scope were the reasons behind what 
seemed to be inconsistencies in the data. 
Patient information was extricated from the raw data 
by data manipulation and reorganization. Data analysis 
was then performed to extrapolate important inputs for the 
model including arrival and discharge patterns, and to 
segment frail patient data. By clustering this data, frail 
patients were grouped according to their acute LOS into 
four categories coded numerically from zero to four, each 
representing a degree of complexity based on the validated 
assumption that the most complex cases spend more time 
in hospital. All 65+ patient data was also categorized by 
age group into five clusters. Based on the data analysis and 
segmentation,  elderly patients’ degree of complexity and 
age group would be used during simulation to define their 
care pathways within the model. The percentages of  
patients classified with each degree of  complexity are 
shown in Table 2.

B. 
Model Development and Validation 
Based on the conceptual model and the empirical data 
analysis, a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model 
was constructed using a simulation package and an 
input/output Excel spreadsheet was developed as a user-
friendly interface. Modules of the simulation model were 
connected similar to the conceptual flow chart, which 
eases the model construction phase. Accordingly, the top-
level of the simulation model defined the overall model 
structure, and sub-level blocks comprised additional 
modules with more details. Object-oriented programming 
was used to customize pre-defined blocks for constructing 
the simulation model. The main entities for the simulation 
were elderly patients, where each patient is assigned a set 
of attributes that represent their degree of complexity and 
age group to determine their discharge destination. 
Statistical assumptions were included by using a Poisson 
distribution 
for 
the 
arrival 
rate 
and 
exponential 
distributions for service times [22]. The time unit used was 
days for all modeling inputs and outputs. A database was 
used to save the measured Key Performance Indicators 
(KPI) after each simulation run, followed by exporting the 
KPIs in a tabular form for further analysis and validation. 
To reduce the model development cycle time and to 
increase the confidence in the simulation model results, 
verification and validation were carried out all the way 
through the development phase to confirm the model 
represents the actual patient flow [23]. After each model 
development phase, the model was verified and validated 
with respect to other previously completed phases. For the 
verification process, the model logic was verified to ensure 
that patients followed the correct care pathway as 
expected. This was achieved by visual tracking of patients 
using animation and by checking intermediate output 
values such as queue lengths and waiting times. 
Initially, queues at each stage of patient care were set 
as empty and idle. A warm-up period of three months was 
found to mitigate any bias introduced by the initial 
conditions of the simulation model until the steady state 
was achieved. In order to be comparable with the provided 
data, results for one year were generated for each scenario 
by running the model for 465 days and discarding the 
results of the first 100 days that represented the warm up 
period. Different number of runs (i.e., replicates) were 
tested and it was found that 10 runs per scenario were 
sufficient to obtain unbiased estimators of the expected 
average of each KPI. 
IV. 
SCENARIOS 
To improve patient flow, a number of strategies were 
proposed by the project team. Examined scenarios in 
addition to performance metrics are presented in this 
section. 
A. 
Key Performance Indicators 
Although the model produced a portfolio of results, the 
following KPIs that focus on acute hospital measures were 
selected: 
• 
Acute waiting time: the average time spent by 
patients waiting for admission to an acute hospital. 
• 
Acute access: the ratio of admitted elderly patients 
to the demand for admission. 
• 
Throughput rate: the total number of elderly 
patients discharged per year. 
• 
Average cost per patient: this cost perspective was 
added to the model to reflect financial effects of 
different scenarios. The average cost per patient 
was calculated by dividing total cost incurred 
through bed usage by the total number of 
discharged patients. 
Due to data confidentiality of the project, the results 
reported for each scenario in this paper have been 
anonymized by normalization by setting the current “as-is” 
values at one and reporting scenario results as percentages 
relative to the as-is figure. 
B. 
Shorter Acute LOS for Frail Patients 
One of the first strategies that the management team 
proposed to improve patient flow was to set a target of 
maximum acute LOS for frail elderly patients, whose 
current LOS exceeds 45 days. In such a case, hospitals 
would be instructed to make earlier decisions about an 
elderly patient’s medical needs and degree of frailty to 
accelerate their discharge from hospital. A scenario was 
tested assuming that frail elderly patients would have a 
maximum acute LOS of 18 days, slightly longer than non-
frail patients. 
The results of testing this scenario, presented in the bar 
chart in Figure 2, show some improvement in patient flow. 
Throughput rate and acute access have increased by 6% 
and 8% respectively, while acute waiting time and 
cost/patient have decreased with similar percentages. 
Performance improvement in this scenario could be 
viewed as somewhat limited due to the fact that frail 
patients whose LOS currently exceeds 18 days constitute 
54% of all frail patients and only 10% of the entire elderly 
population and therefore reducing this duration would not 
have a major global impact on the efficiency of the entire 
system. 
Despite their interest in testing this scenario, healthcare 
policy makers foresaw its drawbacks. The dependence of 
acute LOS on patient diagnosis and required medical 
procedures could hamper the implementation a maximum 
LOS policy and may face resistance from medical staff. 
Hence, other more effective and pertinent solutions should 
be sought.

C. 
Intermediate Care 
The second proposed strategy was the introduction of a 
new service similar to Intermediate Care in the UK that 
can serve patients who require an acute or rehabilitation 
bed for prolonged periods only because they are awaiting 
discharge to LTC [21]. Intermediate care beds will be 
mostly located offsite and will provide a transitional venue 
where frail elderly patients can spend time before they will 
be placed in a long term facility. The anticipated 
advantage of intermediate care is reducing the overall time 
spent by elderly patients in hospitals. This should result in 
significant cost savings since the operational cost of an 
intermediate care bed is estimated to be almost half of the 
cost of an acute bed for the same period of time. To assess 
the impact of this service on the elderly care system, 
different scenarios were examined using the developed 
simulation model where each experiment used a set of 
different capacities of intermediate care beds. The gradient 
increase in intermediate care beds is proportional to the 
static number of acute beds in the system starting with 5% 
of the acute bed capacity and increasing the intermediate 
care-to-acute bed ratio up to 20% in subsequent scenarios. 
Introducing intermediate care beds appears to have an 
overall positive effect on patient flow by noticeably 
increasing throughput rate and acute access to up to 2.5 
times while reducing acute waiting time and cost/patient to 
up to 50% of the current figures as shown in Figure 3. 
Intermediate care beds reduce waiting times for acute 
admission and rehabilitation because they accelerate the 
release of acute and rehabilitation beds back into the 
system. This results in having more beds available for the 
incoming demand. Despite the fact that intermediate care 
would be the last stage that precedes LTC, it is observed 
that it has almost no effect on LTC waiting time. This was 
not unexpected, as LTC waiting time is constrained by 
LTC bed supply, regardless of where elderly patients 
would wait for LTC placement.

D. 
Design of Experiments and ANOVA 
In addition to evaluating the previous strategies, there 
was an interest from healthcare executives to gain insights 
of the dynamics of the elderly care system and also to 
identify the most significant factors that affect its overall 
performance.  Using an orthogonal array (L27) a fractional 
factorial design of experiment was conducted [25][26]. 
The L27 design allows for up to 13 factors where each 
factor is tested at three levels: high, medium and low (H-
M-L). Six selected factors were tested and the values for 
H-M-L levels where determined in relation to the current 
state figures, where one of the three levels was set as the 
as-is value. Based on the selected orthogonal array, 
twenty-seven experiments were carried out and the 
response (i.e., output) measured in each experiment was 
the system’s throughput rate, as recommended by 
healthcare executives. This was followed by a six-way 
Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) test to determine the 
significance of the six selected factors (Table 3). To 
mitigate the inflation of error, Bonferroni correction was 
used to compute the significance level (α) using the 
following equation: 
 
α = α[PT] / n 
(1) 
where α[PT] is the significance level per test (i.e., alpha 
per experiment) and n is the number of comparisons [27]. 
With α[PT] = 0.05 and n = 18, the equation produces a 
significance level of α = 0.00278.

Accordingly, ANOVA results illustrate that the LOS in 
rehabilitation and percentage of patients that receive 
rehabilitation are the only significant factors that affect the 
throughput rate as indicated by P-values that are lower 
than the computed significance level. Results also clarify 
that there are no significant interactions between any two 
factors. 
Regression analysis followed the ANOVA test to 
determine the relative impact of the significant factors on 
the throughput rate when moving from one level to 
another. The regression produced negative coefficients for 
the two significant factors indicating that they are both 
inversely proportional to the throughput rate. This is 
explained by the fact that increasing the percentage and 
LOS of rehabilitation patients decreases throughput rate as 
less patients are discharged per year. The negative 
correlations of both factors with the throughput rate are 
plotted in Figure 4. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Healthcare executives in Ireland are confronted by a 
critical capacity planning challenge due to the mounting 
demand for elderly healthcare services instigated by 
population ageing. Developing a simulation model to 
investigate the service constraints was found to be a well-
suited approach to provide decision makers with a tool to 
evaluate proposed strategies. Conceptual modeling was 
used to illustrate different elderly patient care pathways 
and provide a better understanding of resources required 
during the care journey. This phase was followed by 
developing a discrete-event simulation model with an 
objective of investigating the impact of demand 
uncertainty on available capacity.  The model was of great 
benefit to policy makers in forecasting the outcomes of 
potential strategies that were under investigation. The 
reduction of average length of stay of patients using acute 
beds in hospitals, if possible, can offer a mediocre 
improvement in patient flow. Results have also shown that 
the introduction of intermediate care beds can enhance the 
system’s performance significantly by reducing delays and 
patient cost of stay by almost 50%. Moreover, the 
proposed model has the potential to fully examine the 
economic feasibility of implementing this intermediate bed 
solution based on a cost-benefit analysis in addition to any 
other scenarios proposed by policy makers. 
An ANOVA statistical analysis revealed that the 
rehabilitation phase is a bottleneck that affects untoward 
patient flow. It could therefore be concluded that efforts to 
improve the flow of elderly patients within the healthcare 
system should be directed more towards rehabilitation 
rather than other stages of the patient treatment journey. 
Hence, it is strongly recommended that future research 
would study the impact of the rehabilitation stage and its 
capacity on patient throughput. Potential strategies to be 
considered include setting a maximum rehabilitation LOS 
and transferring a number of acute beds to rehabilitation.

Figure 4.  Effect of significant factors on throughput rate 
 
It is worth mentioning that the main challenge in this 
study was the data collection phase. Problems varied 
between irrelevant, insufficient, or accuracy issues. In 
several instances, the lack of data was overcome by 
relying on assumptions made by healthcare experts. 
Comprehensive and periodic collection of elderly patient 
data is strongly recommended to provide decision makers 
with a solid foundation to use for process improvement 
strategies. Furthermore, a detailed cost analysis was not 
possible in this phase of the study due to two main 
reasons; (1) lack of cost related information and, (2) the 
high variability in cost models used within Irish public 
hospitals that creates a high level of complexity. 
Nevertheless, a recently launched project within the same 
research group will attempt to create a financial model for 
public hospitals in Ireland to facilitate cost analysis and 
optimization.
