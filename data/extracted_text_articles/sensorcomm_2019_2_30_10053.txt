Abstract—The usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for diﬀerent tasks has rapidly increased in re-
cent years. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is an unpiloted
aircraft that operates by remote control or onboard
computers. This technology has become promising in
providing new opportunities in many ﬁelds, such as
smart agriculture, photogrammetry, remote sensing,
wireless coverage, rescuing and many others. Control-
ling the mobility of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle while
monitoring geographical zones is one of the most im-
portant problems. In this context, managing the ﬂight
route by ﬁnding an optimal path that fully covers the
Area of Interest with minimum energy consumption is
one of the main challenges. In this work, we propose an
algorithm to scan an area that reduces completion-time
and energy consumption. It also ensures a complete
coverage of the area. We consider an Area of Interest
without obstacles and non-ﬂying zones.
Keywords—Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Coverage Path

I. Introduction
The rapid technology dissemination and advances in
the control ﬁeld and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
(MEMS) gave rise to a new chain of developments on mini
UAVs. The usage of UAVs or drones in remote sensing
scenarios has grown fast in the last years. Many applica-
tion domains address terrain coverage, such as surveillance
[1], smart farming [2], photogrammetry [3], disaster man-
agement [4–7], civil security, wildﬁre tracking [8–11] and
many others [3][12][13]. Coverage Path Planning (CPP)
is basically ﬁnding the route that covers every point of a
certain Area of Interest (AoI). A main requirement in CPP
is to reduce the completion-time of the overall mission and,
at the same time, to ensure a complete coverage of the
area. The key elements in the scanning mission are the
drones types and the trajectory plan.
A. Drone Type and Application domains
UAVs can be divided into three main types: Rotary
Wing, Fixed Wing and Hybrid [14–16]. They have diﬀerent
features, sizes and speciﬁcations like footprint, weight,
power support (gas, electric, nitro, solar, etc.).
Rotory drones, also known as rotary-wings drones, allow
vertical take-oﬀ and landing. They may hover over a ﬁxed
location to produce continuous cellular coverage. This type
of aerial platform can also be classiﬁed into single-rotor
(helicopter) and multi-rotor (quadcopter and hexacopter).
Quadcopters are inexpensive and have good maneuver-
ability. They are widely applied in surveillance missions,
such as in conﬁned spaces and close-range inspection tasks,
marine settings and terrestrial areas with steep terrain, or
extensive vegetation cover [14][17].
Fixed wing drones are comparatively weighty, as they
need signiﬁcant battery power. However, they have the
advantage of carrying higher payloads. Furthermore, they
are suitable to be deployed in a large area because of their
high durability and long ﬂight time duration. However,
they cannot focus on the same scene for a long period
of time due to their high speed. They cannot stop or
slow down the speed during the mission. Thus, ﬁxed wing
drones cannot be used as remote ﬂying camera controllers
as they need high speed sensors to survey [18].
Hybrid drones can switch their ﬂight/operation mode:
in one mode they are ready to ﬂoat, similar to helicopters,
and in the alternative mode, they ﬂy, similar to ﬁxed wing
drones.
UAVs are used in various ﬁelds ranging from the mili-
tary, humanitarian relief, disaster management to agricul-
ture. Below we present a few typical examples [19–21]:
• Rescue and search: Drones can be used in emergency
cases for rescue and search. They can overcome the
diﬃculty of crossing areas that humans cannot reach,
bridging isolated areas and enhancing wireless cover-
age.
• Smart policing: Most of the cities police or private
agencies use drones to keep an eye on the crowd dur-
ing any event. It also provides detailed documentation
of a crime and accident scenes.
• Smart transportation and monitoring systems: New
UAV application areas are enabled by Internet of
Things (IoT). Drone mapping capabilities are helping
set the foundation for the future. They oﬀer many
services and opportunities that can beneﬁt smart
cities applications (medical [22], package delivery,
traﬃc monitoring and ﬁreﬁghting) [23]. Commercial
applications are focused on delivering products via
new type of smart transportation systems from depots
to homes of end-users.
• Smart agriculture: Monitoring the growing process
of plants can beneﬁt from the use of drones. Data
collected from UAVs can be used for the analysis of
soils and drainage. It can also be used for the crop

health assessment. The use of drones gives farmers a
richer picture of their ﬁelds.
• Entertainment and Media: Advertising, entertain-
ment, aerial photography, shows and special eﬀects
[24].
• Security: Monitoring lines and sites, proactive re-
sponse.

broadcasting.
B. Motivation
The energy constraints and ﬂight limitations of UAVs
have attracted signiﬁcant attention from researches as
they directly impact the network performance in Coverage
Path Planning missions [25–28]. On-board energy in UAV
are consumed for powering the movements of the drone
(hovering, horizontal and vertical motions). However, in-
creasing battery size is not an alternative key solution as
the energy consumption increases when the drone carries
extra payload and has more weight [29][30]. Moreover,
additional energy could be consumed in the air in the
presence of winds [31–33].
Two main performance metrics mainly reﬂects energy
consumption and completion-time. These metrics are path
length (or the traveled distance) [12][34] and the number
of turns [18][29]. The number of turns during a mission
impacts the time needed to accomplish the entire path.
In [35], authors rely on these metrics to ﬁnd the optimal
path. These metrics are compared and investigated in [36].
Studies show that, for UAVs, a path with less turns is more
eﬃcient in terms of route length, duration and energy.
Lowering the number of turns leads to a lower delay in
completion-time and thus to a shorter path. Consequently,
lower energy consumption is resulted.
In our work, we consider having one rotary wing drone.
We aim to cover an Area of Interest without obstacles
and non-ﬂying zones. The main challenges in our work are
as follows: achieving minimum completion-time, minimum
number of turns, lowering the energy consumption, and
having a shortest mission path to cover the whole area.
The method described in this paper makes use of grid
partitioning to reach its goal.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The
related works are presented in Section II. In Section III,
we present our contribution. The computational experi-
ments and results are discussed in Section IV. Section V
concludes our paper.
II. Related Works
The Internet of Flying Robots (IoFR) is a sub-concept
of the Internet of Things (IoT) [37] and Internet of Robotic
Things [38]. The Rlying Robots (FRs) may refer to drones,
UAVs, or airships in diﬀerent applications [39]. CPP is
classiﬁed as subtopic of the path planning in robotics. Its
objective is to cover a free space in an environment and
obtaining a low cost path with minimum overlapping [40].
Various approaches have been proposed to compute a low
cost coverage path [41–43] such as mirror mapping method
[44], in-ﬁeld obstacles classiﬁcation [45], context-aware
UAV mobility [46]. Among the diﬀerent decomposition-
based coverage methods that are used for coverage appli-
cations, we mention Classical exact cellular decomposition
[47], Boustrophedon decomposition [48] and trapezoidal
decomposition [49], landmark based topological coverage
[50] and grid-based methods [51]. Several research stud-
ies focus on the Coverage Path Planning from diﬀerent
perspectives. They propose trajectory solutions with dif-
ferent scenarios taking into consideration diﬀerent factors:
area shape, status of the plan (Online/oﬄine), number of
drones, completion-time, energy consumption.
A. Area shape and Plan status
The area shape plays a role in deﬁning the trajectory
method for coverage. An AoI could have a regular shape
[55][56][60] or an irregular shape [17]. A review of existing
approaches resulted in works that explore rectangular
areas. Others assume convex polygonal environments with
diﬀerent type of sensors mounted on the UAV (visual sen-
sors, thermal sensors, etc) [36][52][65]. Information about
the environment is either available oﬄine or online. Several
approaches consider online path plan mainly used to cover
mobile sensors in real-time or to modify path depending
on sudden changes in the surrounding atmosphere [66].
The basic approach for Oﬄine CPP algorithms is the area
decomposition, determining the visiting sequence of the
sub regions, and covering decomposed regions to obtain a
complete coverage path [43][67][68].
B. Coverage Motion and Path Planning
The large majority of strategies for Coverage Path
Planning rely on decomposing the area into cells that
must be visited and covered. The whole area is divided
using exact or approximate cellular decomposition. Au-
thors in [3][26] adopt grid-based technique to divide the
area into squared cells. Each square contains occupancy
information of the part of the environment that it covers.
Cells are usually explored by back-and-forth motions using
single drone such as in [56][62]. Authors in [59][61][68] use
multiple drones, and back-and-forth motion to cover the
area in oﬄine mode. They aim for less number of turn-
ing maneuvers. Other approaches adopt spiral or circular
motions. Authors in [54] adopt Spiral motion and use
single drone. They aim to cover an area in oﬄine mode in
less mission completion-time and shorter distance. Others
adopt multiples drones to reduce the path length [57][58].
Authors in [60] relied on Integer Linear Programming for
collision avoidance. They try to reduce the ﬂight time and
energy consumption. Table I shows a list of CPP related
works with the adopted area shape, number of drones, plan
status and challenges they tackle.

III. Contribution
In this work, we are going to use one rotary wing drone
to cover an area in an oﬄine mode without obstacles and
non-ﬂying zones. We planned the path using Grid based
technique with tractor mobility path pattern. We applied
sub-division on the main heatmap to tune the path and
reduce the number of turns and save energy. The main
phases in our path planning method are presented below:

format
(black/white image). We generate a matrix represen-
tation (heatmap) of the area (Figure 1(a)) and map
it to a grid-based form (Figure 1(b)). The required
matrix dimensions (i.e, length and width) are given
by the path planner. It depends on the UAV footprint
and determines the size of each grid cell in our work.
Concerning the scan direction, we choose it to
be parallel to the longest side of the grid (length
or width). Using principal axis transformation, the
longest side of the area is aligned parallel to the Y-axis
of the image. Each value on the heatmap represents
a percentage of the area covered in a grid cell.

UAV coverage range: The path planer deﬁnes
the coverage range for the UAV. Basically, a UAV’s
coverage projection (or footprint) is circular shape.
However, due to the usage of grid-based method in
our work (i.e, grid-cells have rectangular shape), we
consider the rectangle inscribed in the footprint circle
(see Figure 2). Each rectangle is going to represent a
grid-cell entity.

B. Path Pattern and trajectory generation
1) Basic approach
A tractor mobility pattern covers all nodes without
leaving any gap [69]. It pursues parallel tracks to the
grid dimensions, as shown in Figure 3(a). The turn angle
is always 90°. However, the path crossing points v1, v2,
v3 passes through unneeded cell (example cell A1). Since
point v3 is higher than v1, a UAV has to move to point v2
and make the rectangular angle.
In our basic plotting approach, we modify the turn
angles to get trapezoidal tracks (see Figure 3(b)). By this
modiﬁcation, the path length is shorter. The track’s end-
point is the center of the last non-zero value cell on the
track. A path track crosses the center of the grid cells that
have non-zero values.
For example, in Figure 3(b), assume that the UAV is
positioned at v1 and is moving upward. Instead of moving
to cell A1, a turn is to be done at point v2 (cell A2) which

proach)
Figure 3. Tractor mobility- Trapezoidal and Rectangular Turns
is the center of the last non-zero-value cell. The calculation
of the turn angle is explained in section III-B3.
Another concern can be raised when the grid cell con-
tains small portion of the area. Is it possible to cover the
portion without moving to the center of the grid as this
avoids long path? In Figure 3(b), cell A2, a small portion
of the area exists. the same portion of the area can be
covered by moving directly from v1 to v3 as shown in
Figure 3(c). This can reduce the energy consumed during
the movement. The below section explains how we plan
the new trajectory. The main ideas discussed below are
(a) the selection of the turning positions, (b) the selection
of the start point and the direction of the trajectory.
2) Path turning and plotting points
In order to determine the accurate position at which a
turning is to be done, we divide each grid cell into a group
of 4 subcells. The new heatmap of the area in Figure 1(a)
is presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Resulted Heat-Map after the subdivision (grid: 20
x12)
Figure 5(b) represents the heatmap of Figure 3(c) after
subdivision. We investigate the heatmap values of the
subcells to determine at which side the portion of the area
is located in the cell, as well as, the turning position and
degree.

(b) case 2
(c) case 3
(d) case 4
Figure 5. Subdivision of a grid cell
The main steps in the trajectory generation are:
• Step 1: Perform the subdivision of the original grid
cells and generate the new heatmap. Assume the orig-
inal dimensions are L x W, the new grid dimensions
are L′ = max{2W, 2L} and W ′ = min{2W, 2L}. We
denote by H the matrix as follows:
H = {hij ∈ [0, 1]|i ∈ [1, L′] ∧ j ∈ [1, W ′]}
Each grid cell has a positive value in the heatmap H .
• Step 2: We denote by ζ the set of non-zero columns
in the grid (|ζ| <= W ′). A column p (denoted ζp)
belongs to ζ if and only if the following holds:
ζp ∈ ζ ⇔ ∃hip > 0 ∧ i ∈ [1, L′]
ζp = {hij ∈ H |j = p ∧ i ∈ [1, L′]}
thus,
ζ = {ζp|p ∈ [1, W ′]}

Let Fp denotes the ﬁrst non-zero cells in column
ζp (see Figure 6):
Fp = {hip ∈ ζp|hip > 0 ∧ i < i′, ∀i′ ∈ [1, L′]}
Let Lp denote the Last non-zero cells in column ζp as
follows:
Lp = {hip ∈ ζp|hip > 0 ∧ i > i′, ∀i′ ∈ [1, L′]}
The cardinalities of Fp and Lp are |Fp| = |Lp| = 1.
For example, in Figure 4, ζ3 has F3 located at row 2
and L3 located at row 14.
We start the trajectory planning from the ﬁrst
column in ζ. Each path track (denoted q) is going
to be the vertical middle line between two adjacent
columns in the grid. Track q1 is the vertical middle
line between ζ1 and ζ2, Track q2 is the middle line
between ζ3 and ζ4 and so on.
We are going to
Figure 6. Notations
investigate the positions of Fp and Lp in order to
determine the turning points of each track. It should
be noted that the two points of a track segment are
the track start-point and turning-point. Except for
the last track that has only a start-point and a stop-
point.
• Step 3: Formally, a grid is represented as graph
G(V, E), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set
of edges. The center of the grid box (or range) formed
by 4 adjacent cells represents a node v in the graph
(see Figure (6)). These nodes (once determined) will
be linked together to form the ﬁnal path.
In general, for two columns ζp and ζp+1, the range
at row r and row (r+1), is denoted
[hrp: h(r+1)(p+1)]
, where r∈ [1, L′[. Let vrq be the center of this range.
Two cases occurs (see Figure 7):
(1) If the end-point of a track q is located from the
side of the ﬁrst elements of ζp and ζp+1, the two
possible turning points (or nodes) are:
- The center of the range that contains the ﬁrst
element in ζp.
- The center of the range that contains the ﬁrst
element in ζp+1.
(2) If the end-point of a track q is located from the
side of the last elements of ζp and ζp+1, the ranges
for the turning points are calculated from the Last
elements of ζp and ζp+1. In this case, the two points
are:
- The center of the range that contains the Last
element in ζp.
- The center of the range that contains the Last
element in ζp+1.
The range is the same as deﬁned above.
If h(r+1)(p+1) = 0 or h(r+1)p = 0 or r = L′, the range
becomes:
[h(r−1)p : hr(p+1)]
• Step 4: To tune the path and choose between the
two possible turning points on a track q, we follow
the steps presented in Figure 8. Assume that the
start direction of track q is vertical ascending, the
algorithm indicates the turning point as well as, the
next node on the coming track (q+1). This point is
the start point of the new track. The algorithm checks
the position of each node in the grid in order to draw
the path link from one track to another. This link
forms an edge of the graph.
• Step 5: According to our trajectory pattern, for each
track, there are two options for the direction:
Option1: UAV moves vertically ascending from the
side of last element (Lp) of the track q to the ﬁrst
element (Fp). In this case, a turning point is located
on the side of the First element. The corresponding
path planning was described in the previous sections.
Option2: UAV moves vertically descending from the
side of the ﬁrst element of the track p (Fp) to the last
element (Lp). In this case, the turning point of track
q and the start point of track (q+1) are located on
the side of the last element. The same steps described
in the previous presented algorithm (Figure 8) are
applied. We reverse the operators in the conditions.
3) Turn angle calculation
Let’s go back to Figure 3(c), the turn angle at
point v2 is the exterior angle between nodes v1, v2,
v3. We denote it ϕ123.
Each node v ∈ V has coordinate (x, y) in the
cartesian plan. Let vi, vj ∈V denote speciﬁc nodes
and eij ∈ E denotes an edge between nodes vi and
vj. d(vi, vj) is the distance between them.
d(vi, vj) =
q

It has been mentioned earlier that UAV’s power con-
sumption decreases when the number of turns performed
during the mission decreases [67]. We aim to have a
compromise between the length of the generated path and
the number of turn in such a way to cover the whole
area with minimum energy consumption and completion-

IV. Computational Experiments and Result
In this section, we perform a set of comparisons with
diﬀerent ﬂight patterns. We demonstrate the performance
of our proposed method for the CPP problem.
The performance metrics are completion-time and en-

where completion-time is denoted by T, S for route
length, V is UAV movement speed, while k is the number
of turns, ϕ is the angle of uth turn and ω is the UAV
rotation rate.
- Energy model: We adopt the following energy model
[67] to evaluate our work. Below we give a quick recapit-

In our experimentation, we assume that λ = 0.1164
KJ/unit length and γ = 0.0173 KJ/degree.
(i) Scenario 1: We compared our algorithm to the basic
spiral and spiral convex hull patterns on irregular star
area shape. The grid is 10rows*6columns. The grid cell
dimension is (0.98274 x 1.39335 unit2). The paths are
presented in Figure 9.
We assume that the UAV speed = 0.5 unit/sec and UAV
rotation rate ω= 30 degree/sec. The paths are compared
according to completion-time and energy consumption.
The comparative results are presented in Table II.
The
table shows that our path length is 15.499% shorter than
the spiral path pattern in Figure 9(a). It is also 6.666%
shorter than the path in Figure 9(b) with reduction of
81.725% and 15.01% in number of turns in degree. This

Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 show the tra-
jectory planning in L shape, U shape and Y shape area
respectively. The comparison is between our approach
and Spiral technique. The scenarios are tested with a
speed v=0.5 unit/sec and a rotation degree ω= 30
degree/sec assuming that the grid cell dimension is
10*10 unit2.

Figure 15. Trajectory planning in our work v/s CPP’s
algorithm in Ref. [3]
Table IV shows that our path is 17.989% shorter than
the path in Figure 15(a) with reduction of 41.17% in
number of turns. This means better energy saving. Re-
sults show that the mission completion-time is reduced
by 25.79% in our work, with energy saving of 36.98%
compared to the results obtained in [3]. It should be noted
that the area is not totally covered by the work in [3].
There are two cells in Figure 15(a) that are part of the
area and the drone didn’t cover them. However, in our
work all required cells are covered.
In Figure 16, we present the gain percentage in
completion-time in our work over the work in [3]. We take
diﬀerent UAV speed and rotation rate values. Results show
mission time reduction up to 32.97%.
(iii) Scenario 3: We compared our trajectory plan
to work presented in [26] on an area grid of dimension
6rowsx10columns. The obtained path patterns are pre-
sented in Figure 17. The cell dimension is 1 x 1 unit2.
The resulted values are shown in Table V.
Table V shows that our path is 8.301% shorter than the
path in [26] with reduction in number of turns by 61.904%.
As for the completion-time, it is reduced by 29.37% in our
work, with a 53.53% less in energy consumption.

V. Conclusion
We proposed an energy aware coverage path planning
method. In our work, we use one drone to cover areas
without obstacles and nonﬂying zones in an oﬄine mode.
The results show that our work covers the whole area
and has lower completion-time and energy consumption
in comparison to the state of the art and the test cases
used. In the future work, we plan to extend the proposed
method to study the CPP in the presence of obstacles in
the Area of Interest.
