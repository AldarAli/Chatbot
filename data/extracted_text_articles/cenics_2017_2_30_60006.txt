Abstract—This paper presents a reconfigurable two-stage 
power amplifier (PA) for use in 4G LTE unmanned aerial 
vehicles (UAVs) applications. The PA using the TSMC bulk 65-
nm CMOS process exhibits a saturated output power of 29.8 
dBm, a power gain of 35.6 dB, a maximum power added 
efficiency (PAE) of 27.2 % at 2.5 GHz and maintains PAE over 
10 % in the output power’s 8 dB back-off zone as required by 
LTE’s power-to-average power ratio (PAPR) specifications. 
The proposed reconfigurable PA architecture, which includes 
four sub PA cells with the power cell switching (PCS) technique, 
allows the high level of efficiency in back-off of output power. 
The four sub-PA cells are composed of three differential cascode 
stages, supplied by 3.3 V and implemented with the segmented 
bias (SB) technique to maintain the high level of PAE, reduce 
the DC power consumption and reconfigure the output 
impedance.

bias; differential; neutralization technique. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Since UAVs are highly mobile devices, they need 
transceivers that minimize space and power consumption 
whilst facilitating mobile applications requiring high bit rates 
over wide coverage areas. CMOS, as a powerful platform, 
has recently demonstrated a tremendous interest in industry 
with a fully integrated radio system-on-chip (SoC) solution 
for transceivers. CMOS power amplifiers designed for 
wireless communications standard, such as LTE, LTE-A and 
WiMAX, require good performances about output power, 
efficiency and linearity. 
Modern high-data-rate communication systems, using 
spectrally efficient modern scheme like Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a high 
power-to-average- power ratio (PAPR), require RF power 
amplifiers about high linearity and high efficiency. The main 
challenge for LTE power amplifiers is hence to achieve the 
good trade-off between high linearity and high efficiency 
over wide power range. Furthermore, delivering watt-level 
output power is another challenge for CMOS RF power 
amplifiers because of low break-down voltage and high knee 
voltage of transistors. Several techniques hence have been 
investigated to overcome this limitation of CMOS namely 
stacked transistors [3].  
To find the best linearity/efficiency trade-off while 
reducing thermal problems, the power cell switching (PCS) 
technique [1][2], which can be used to combine output power 
from sub-PA cells, provides a high level of efficiency and 
preserves a good linearity. To push upper back-off efficiency 
of PA, a combination of the PCS technique and the 
segmented bias (SB) [4][5] helps PA not only operate with 
higher efficiency in a wider range of output back-off power 
(OBO) but also deal with the problem of short battery life of 
mobile devices. 
This paper proposes a reconfigurable multi-mode RF 
power amplifier to further enhance efficiency in back-off 
power zone. The proposed PA is composed of four 
differential cascode segmented-biased sub-PA cells to 
achieve high output power and high back-off efficiency, as 
shown in Figure 1. Implemented in the TSMC bulk 65-nm 
CMOS process, the PA achieves high efficiency to 8 dB of 
power back-off and also substantially scales down the 
thermal power consumption. Its operation modes are 
controlled by two bias voltages (Vbias1, Vbias2) of each sub-
PA cell and two supply voltages (Vdd1, Vdd2).  
This paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses the 
concept and design of the reconfigurable power amplifier. 
Section III presents the post-layout simulation results. These 
results include the continuous-wave (CW) simulation data, 
which meet linearity and output power requirements, with 
high efficiency for 4G LTE signals at 2.5 GHz. The paper will 
finish with a short conclusion in Section IV. 
II. 
CIRCUIT DESIGN 
A. Design of the proposed reconfigurable power amplifier 
The 2.5 GHz CMOS reconfigurable multi-mode power 
amplifier is implemented and simulated using Keysight’s 
Golden Gate in post-layout simulation.  
In Figure 1, the architecture of the proposed 
reconfigurable multi-mode power amplifier is introduced. 
The four parallel sub-PA cells are designed in three-stage 
differential cascode topology with the segmented bias 
technique and the neutralization technique. The transformer 
TR1 achieves the impedance matching between the 100 Ohm 
RF input and the input impedance of driver. The transformer 
TR2 is a power splitter and can be used as an inter-stage 
impedance matching network. The transformer TR3 
combines the power from the four sub-PA cells and matches 
the impedance from the four sub-PA cells to the 100 Ohm  
RF output.

By switching each sub-PA cell on/off and adjusting the 
bias point of each transistor in common source of sub-PA 
cells, this PA can be reconfigured to enhance back-off  
power efficiency.

B. Design of sub-PA cells 
To stabilize each sub-PA cell, two neutralization 
capacitors C9, C10  [6][7], which dramatically reduce the 
Miller effect capacitance of differential cascode, are carefully 
added for the sake of maintaining the circuit in the 
unconditionally stable region. Their chosen values are fixed at 
1.23 pF.

Figure 2. Sub PA cell with the segmented bias technique 
In order to increase efficiency of the PA stage, a new 
topology based on individually biasing the common source 
stage is proposed in Figure 2. Stacked MOSFET differential 
cascode structure using deep N-well transistors consists of 
two common gate (CG) stages and one common source (CS) 
stage. The capacitors C5, C6  at the gates of each stacked 
transistor are chosen to balance drain source voltage swings 
of four transistors’ CG stages. The external gate capacitance 
and the gate-to-source capacitance of each stacked transistor 
form a capacitive voltage divider to produce the proper in-
phase voltage swing at the transistor’s gate and drain [3]. 
Transistors M5, M6, M7, M8  are biased in class AB and sized 
with a width (W) and a length (L) of 60 µm and 60 nm, 
respectively. 
In the CS stage, transistors ( M1; M2), (M4; M3)  are 
biased separately in class AB with a size of W/3L  
(20 µm/60 nm) and class C with a size of 2W/3L  
(40 µm/60 nm) respectively. This method keeps the sub-PA 
cells in high power and high efficiency region due to the good 
performances of class AB amplifiers in low power region and 
of class C amplifiers in high power region. The segmented 
bias technique (SB) [4][5] allows to significantly scale down 
DC power consumption compared to class AB.  
 The estimated size of the sub PA cell’s layout is  
396.84 µm x 251.5 µm (Figure 10). 
C. Design of Driver cell 
The driver cell is designed with a differential cascode 
structure and biased in class AB with deep N-well transistors 
for the CG and CS stages (Figure 3). The supply voltage 
(Vdriver) is 2.4 V. This driver aims to increase a level of gain 
of the PA. The neutralization capacitors C2, C3 are also used 
to make this cell unconditionally stable. The size of the driver 
is 272 µm x 115.6 µm, as illustrated in Figure 10.

Figure 3. Driver's structure 
D. Design of transformers 
There are three stacked transformers (TR) [8][9] in the 
full design. The first one (TR1) in Figure 10 ensures the 
impedance matching between the driver’s optimal impedance 
and the 100-Ohm input with the size of 252 µm x 674 µm. 
The second one (TR2) in Figure 10 converts the optimal 
output impedance of driver to the optimal input impedance of 
the four sub-PA cells with the size of 197.3 µm x 1706.1 µm. 
This transformer is also used as a splitter to distribute power 
homogenously to each sub-PA cell. The last one (TR3) in 
Figure 10 with the size of 209.3 µm x 1884 µm matches the 
optimal output impedance of the sub-PA cells to the 100 Ohm 
output. The transformer TR3 is carefully designed in order to 
be robust and reliable under high current levels from four 
sub-PA cells. 
E. Reconfigurable states of PA 
To fulfill the requirements of 4G LTE signals with high 
levels of efficiency, the PA can be switched into four possible 
states in Table. 1 to maintain efficiency over 10% in the 8 dB 
back-off power zone. The four states are defined by two bias 
voltages (Vbias1, Vbias2) of the common source transistors 
and two supply voltages: Vdd1 for the sub-PA cells (1, 4) and 
Vdd2 for the sub-PA cells (2, 3).

Three states 1A, 1B and 1C are used in the high power 
(HP) region. In these states, four sub-PA cells are all active. 
More current will be delivered to the load, therefore output 
power can be increased. These states are determined by 
Vbias1 and Vbias2 to satisfy the demands of efficiency, output 
power or linearity. State 2 is used in the medium power (MP) 
region. In this state, the sub-PA cells 2 and 3 are turned off by 
having their supply source (Vdd2) off, whilst the sub-PA cells 
1 and 4 controlled by Vdd1 are kept on. This configuration is 
outlined in Table 1.

POST-LAYOUT SIMULATION RESULTS 
A. S-Parameters results 
This PA achieves promising RF performances and 
performs such good input and output matchings (Figure 4 and 
Figure 5). The values of S11 and S22  at 2.5 GHz are all around 
-20 dB for the four states. The small-signal gains of the PA 
are 36 dB for state 1A and 30.6 dB for state 2 as shown in 
Figure 5. Stability of the circuit is illustrated in Figure 4 . The 
stability factor µ, whose values are over 6 for the four states, 
guarantees unconditional stability of the proposed PA.

B. RF performances 
The power added efficiency (PAE) is illustrated in Figure 
6, the power gain and the output power with 2.5 GHz single-
tone signals are shown in Figure 7. Both figures include the 
post-layout simulated data. Saturated output power Psat  of 
state 1A and state 2 are 29.8 dBm (high power) and 24.8 dBm 
(medium power), respectively. Maximum power gains of four 
stages are 35.6, 34.3, 32.8 and 30.1 dB, respectively. PAE at 
Psat in state 1A is 27.2 % and PAE at 6dB of OBO in state 2 
(Pout = 23.8 dBm) is 18 %, improved by 11%. State 2 
improves significantly back-off efficiency at the MP region. 
To fulfill the requirement at 8dB of PAPR, this PA is 
reconfigured until 8 dB of OBO and reaches 11.8 % of PAE. 
With the SB technique, DC power consumption is reduced to 
2.53 W for state 1B and 1.2 W for state 2 in Figure 8.

Table 2 compares this work with other state-of-the-art 4G 
LTE multi-mode CMOS PAs. This PA achieves a good trade-
off between linearity and efficiency. Gain is significantly 
higher than previous CMOS integrated PAs.

Table 3 outlines the operation of this reconfigurable multi-
mode PA. States of the PA are selected according to desired 
parameters. Therefore, the PA’s efficiency is notably 
augmented in back-off power region. Furthermore, this PA is 
capable of being the best trade-off between efficiency and 
linearity in state 1B and state 2 for the high and medium power 
regions, respectively, as shown in this table.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a fully integrated 4G LTE reconfigurable 
CMOS PA is discussed and implemented. This PA achieves a 
maximum output power of +29.8 dBm and a maximum PAE 
of 27.2 % at 2.5 GHz. Using the segmented bias technique, 
this PA allows a PAE of over 10 % to be maintained in the 
output power’s 8 dB back-off zone as required by LTE’s 
PAPR specifications. The operation mode of the PA is 
controlled by two bias voltages of each sub-PA cell in order 
to trade-off between high linearity and high efficiency.

Moreover, for the purpose of preserving high back-off PAE, 
two sub PA cells can be turned off to keep the PAE over 14 % 
in back-off power zone of 5dB to 7dB.
