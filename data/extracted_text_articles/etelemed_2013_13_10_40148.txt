Abstract—Like data analysis, pattern recognition and data 
mining, fuzzy clustering also has been applied widely, and 
successful applications have been reported. In this paper we 
aim to employ the technique of fuzzy c-means (FCM) cluster to 
prognosticate the operation possibility on gastric cancer 
patients. Our purpose is to partition some clinical data in two 
fuzzy clusters. One of them considers patients who have a 
chance for successful surgery whereas the other cluster 
contains the patients without a view for surgery. Each patient 
is given by characteristic biological markers. The initial values 
of membership degrees taking place in the partition matrix are 
usually determined randomly. In this work we will use 
particularly designed membership functions to calculate the 
degrees of membership. 
Keywords–fuzzy C-means clustering analysis; fuzzy partition; 
operation decision

 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays we are living in an era of the rapid 
development of information technology. A large number of 
information is sent and received every day. Therefore, 
finding some data processing methods to discover the partial 
structure in a data set and to utilize useful information to 
solve efficiently daily issues becomes of vital importance.  
A lot of approaches in this domain have been put 
forward. Cluster analysis is one of them. This method 
involves the task of dividing data points into homogeneous 
classes or clusters so that items in the same class are as 
similar as possible and items in different classes are as 
dissimilar as possible [1]. Moreover, some successful 
applications in clustering analysis have been presented. 
Among clustering approaches the fuzzy c-means clustering 
(FCM) is regarded as well-known and efficient [2–4]. 
In hard clustering, data points are divided into crisp 
clusters, where each data point belongs to exactly one 
cluster [5]. In many situations, boundary data points can be 
difficult to be allocated. Therefore, the realistic picture of 
the data structure may not be correctly presented by the 
crisp clustering. However, fuzzy partition can make up the 
flaw, due to the advantage that data points are allowed to 
belong to more than one cluster.  
The application of fuzzy c-means cluster in medical 
diagnosis with respect to the operation possibility evaluation 
is the focal point of this paper. We attempt to utilize the 
FCM algorithms in order to divide a clinical data set into 
two clusters, where one presents the positive prognosis for 
“operation” and the other samples patients-vectors classified 
for “none operation”. 
The construction of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2 the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is 
presented. In Section 3 we generate the methods for 
calculating the membership degrees to initialize the cluster 
matrix. Further, we provide a reader with the practical 
medical study resulting in operation decision in Section 4 to 
make conclusions concerning the application in Section 5. 
II. 
DESCRIPTION OF FUZZY C-MEANS CLUSTERING 
ALGORITHM 
Let us suppose that ܺ ൌ ሼݔଵ, … ,ݔ௡ሽ is a finite data set. 
Each data point ݔ௞ ൌ ቀݔ௞భ, … ,ݔ௞೛ቁ , ݇ ൌ 1, … , ݊, is a pattern 
vector in R௣. Fuzzy C-means algorithm tries to partition X in 
a collection of ܵ௜ subsets, 2 ൑ ݅ ൑ ܿ, called fuzzy clusters. 
By running the algorithm repeatedly, a list of v௜ cluster 
centers and a partition matrix U are returned. 
The fuzzy c-means algorithm is based on minimizing the 
objective function J with respect to the membership values 
ߤௌ೔ሺݔ௞ሻ and the distance ݀ሺv௜,ݔ௞ሻ [2], where 
In (1) n is the number of data points and c is the number 
of clusters. The value of  ߤௌ೔ሺݔ௞ሻ or ߤ௜௞ represents the value 
of membership degree of ݔ௞ in cluster ܵ௜. Moreover, the 
sum of the membership degrees for each ݔ௞ sample in all 
clusters is equal to 1. The notation of ݀ሺv௜,ݔ௞ሻ indicates the 
Euclidean distance between the cluster center v௜ and ݔ௞. The 
constant ݉ ൐ 1 is called weighting exponent, which 
determines the fuzziness of the resulting clusters. 
A linguistic description of the FCM algorithm is 
presented by the following steps:

1) Select the number of clusters c, initialize the value of 
fuzzy parameter m ሺ2 ൑ ݉ ൏ ∞ሻ and the termination 
tolerance ߳. 
2) Set l = 0. 
3) Determine the initial values of membership degrees in 
partition matrix ܷ௟. 
4) Calculate cluster centers v௜

6) If ԡܷ௟ାଵ െ ܷ௟ԡ ൒ ߳, then set l = l + 1, and go to step 4. 
If ԡܷ௟ାଵ െ ܷ௟ԡ ൑ ߳, then stop the procedure. Matrix 
ܷ௟ାଵ is the most optimal distribution of membership 
degrees of ݔ௞ in clusters ܵ௜. 
 
The prior determination of the membership degrees of 
ݔ௞ in ܵ௜ plays a crucial role in this algorithm, as their choice 
not only can affect the convergence speed, but also may 
have a direct impact on the results of the classification [6]. 
The initial cluster centers are just prototypes and 
unstable. Therefore, they need to be iteratively updated. 
Every iteration guarantees an improvement of the 
coordinates of clustering centers. The updating procedure 
continues until two adjacent membership matrices cease to 
change. In Section 4 we wish to demonstrate how FCM 
algorithm has been applied in operation evaluations for 
gastric cancer patients. 
Furthermore, the calculation of clustering centers 
depends on the values of initial membership degrees in the 
partition matrix. To avoid inaccuracy in final results we will 
discuss the own technique of calculation of membership 
degrees to avoid guessing at their values intuitively. 
III. 
AN APPROACH TO DETERMINING THE INITIAL 
MEMBERSHIP DEGREES IN THE PARTITION MATRIX 
The ccurate evaluation of the membership of ݔ௞ in ܵ௜ 
can improve the iteration time and the convergence speed. 
In this article, the s-class membership function is adopted 
for the further calculations due to [7–9]. We recall the 
formula of the s-function as

The curve, implemented as a graph of (4), starts with 
point  ሺ0,ߙሻ  and ends with  ሺߛ,1ሻ, whereas ߚ is the 
arithmetic mean value of ߙ and ߛ.  
By referring to the most decisive medical factors, such 
as the patient’s age, weight and crp-values (C-reactive 
proteins), operation prognoses usually can be expressed by 
“operation” and “none operation”. The possibilities of the 
decision evaluation can be described by some linguistic 
terms.  
Let us suppose that ܮ ൌ ሼܮଵ, … ,ܮఠሽ is a linguistic list 
consisting of ߱ words. Each word is associated with a fuzzy 
set. In compliance with [8–10], ߱ is a positive odd integer. 
Furthermore, let E be the length of a common reference set 
R, designed for all restrictions characterizing the fuzzy sets 
from L, provided that ݖאܴ. We now wish to divide the 
linguistic terms into three groups recognized as a left group, 
a middle group and a right group. 
The membership functions assigned to the leftmost 
terms are parametric functions, which are presented by (5) 
as

CASE STUDY 
 
To make a decision “operate” contra “do not operate”, 
concerning an individual patient in accordance with his/her 
biological markers’ values, we have to involve the medical 
experience in the decision process. To facilitate a 
conversation with a physician we have prepared a linguistic 
list named “The primary judgment concerning possibility 
that a physician recommends “operation” opposite to “none 
operation””

The excerpt of the data set, shown in TABLE I, consists 
of the patients’ clinical records and primary judgments of 
operation possibilities made by the medical expert. The total 
medical report contains 25 gastric cancer patients randomly 
selected. 
Two surgery states “operation” and “none operation” 
assist two clusters ܵଵ and ܵଶ respectively. By selecting 
words from the list the experienced surgeon makes the 
primary graded decision about possibilities of operating or 
not operating on the patient. 
Each verbal expression, being the term of L, is 
associated with a fuzzy set. ܮଵ and ܮଶ represent two left 
fuzzy sets, ܮଷ is the fuzzy set in the middle, whereas ܮସ and 
ܮହ constitute two rightmost fuzzy sets. Unfortunately, these 
linguistic items do not provide us with any information 
about membership degrees expected in matrix ܷ଴ as 
primary recommendation states of “operation” or “none 
operation”. Therefore we adopted the following technique to 
assign numerical substitutes to verbal expressions from the 
list. 
By inserting E = 100 (the length of the reference set R = 
[0,100] – typical of density measures in medical 
investigations), ߱ = 5 and t = 1, 2, in (5), we obtain the 
membership functions of the first two fuzzy sets, namely,

In the interval [0, 16.7], the membership degree of

none operation is the highest in this region. As the 
membership degrees decrease from 1 to 0 over (16.7, 23.3], 
then z = 16.7 will become a natural border for sure members 
in ܮଵ. In (13),   ݖ ൌ 16.7 א ሾ0, 50ሿ. From the formula of

It is assumed that the sum of membership grades in 
clusters S1 and S2 should be equal to 1 for each ݔ௞, k =

In such cases some adjustments need to be made; therefore 
the following techniques are applied. 
 
Case 1: ߤௌభሺݔ௞ሻ ൅ߤௌమሺݔ௞ሻ ൐ 1.

CONCLUSION 
In this study we have adopted fuzzy 2-means clustering 
analysis to partition a patient data set, containing clinical 
records of 25 gastric cancer patients, in two fuzzy clusters. 
These reveal the numerical decision of states “operation” 
and “none operation” by the values of membership degrees 
due to the rule: the higher the degree is the more certain 
decision should be made with respect to the cluster 
considered.  
We notice that the patients’ original clinical marker 
quantities lead to higher membership degrees in the initial 
partition matrix when comparing them to the lower values in 
the final matrix. This phenomenon can be explained by the 
fact that the decision for an individual patient has been 
made by the assistance of all data filling the data set. This 
means that the medical knowledge provided in the form of 
the collective information, reset numerically, could decide 
“softer” decisions, which have not deprive the patient of a 
chance for surgery. We have engaged a new form of 
experience 
performed 
as 
computerized 
experience 
constituting a database. 
The obtained results converge to cautious expertise 
made by physicians who want the patient to survive as well 
as possible without any unnecessary risks. Therefore, fuzzy 
c-means cluster analysis can be seen as one of the 
approaches that would assist medical operation diagnosis. 
The method can be applied for a large number of patients. 
 
Lastly, we wish to emphasize that the adaptation of 
membership function families to the purpose of determining 
the initial membership degrees in the partition matrix has 
been an efficient tool in the algorithm. The functions, 
furnished with parameters, allow constructing arbitrary 
linguistic lists containing many verbal judgments. The 
mathematical translation of words to numbers has been done 
systematically without predetermining any casual values. 
This has improved definitely the convergence speed of the 
algorithm.
