Abstract-The conventional flexure parallel micromanipulators 
(FPM) usually suffer from small stroke. The performances of a 
FPM are highly related with the stroke of each actuated limb 
and the constraints including the non-actuated limbs. To 
conquer the drawbacks of the small workspace of the 
conventional 
FPM, 
the 
mechanism 
for 
displacement 
amplification would make a great contribution when it is 
imported into the design of the actuated limbs. This research is 
focused on a unique FPM based on multi-level displacement 
amplifier. Firstly, the structure modeling based on compact 
modular design is introduced. The macro/micro analysis of the 
displacement amplifier is conducted. Then, the comprehensive 
finite-element modeling including the strain and total 
deformation 
are 
implemented 
to 
examine 
the 
actual 
mechanical behavior of the proposed mechanism. The 
developed method and technology provide a promising solution 
to enhance the performance of the generic FPMs.

 INTRODUCTION  
    With the rapid and extensive development in both 
theories and applications in the past several decades, parallel 
manipulator has become a nondisplaceable technology 
which reflect its merits in areas of machine tools [1-6], 
sensors and transducers [7-10], micro devices and MEMS 
systems [11-15], and motion platforms [16-18], majorly due 
to its distinct advantages including higher positioning 
precision, higher dynamic performance, higher stiffness, 
less accumulative error and easier for inverse kinematic 
modeling.   
    In the area of multi-axis micro-positioning, many scholars 
have developed different types of flexure parallel 
micromanipulators to achieve the expected goals [19-25]. In 
[20], a 3-limb 6-DOF parallel micromanipulator with 3PPSP 
structure was investigated. In each limb, there are two 
actuator joints which are integrated in a x-y plane attached 
to the base. In [21], the special materials including 
olyvinylidene fluoride and lead zirconium titanate were 
utilized to develop the piezoelectric actuators for the 
vibration control of a planar compliant parallel manipulator. 
In [22], a nanopositioning parallel stage which has high 
bandwidth, high motion range and low cross-coupling was 
developed so that control strategies based on single-input 
single-output for trajectory tracking was available. In [23], a 
compliant positioned based on parallel kinematic structure 
was dually driven by six piezoelectric actuators and six 
piezoelectric ceramics. Through testing, it could be found 
that this structure simultaneously generated wide motion 
range and high precision. In [24], the pseudo rigid-body 
model was calculated for a 3-DOF flexure parallel 
micromanipulator in which three limbs are perpendicular to 
each other. In [25], the electromagnetic actuators with less 
than 0.1% full-scale position error were fabricated to drive a 
six-axis compliant parallel mechanism.   
    However, since every coin has its opposite side, 
especially for the case of parallel micromanipulators, the 
natural limitation of the small stroke of the traditional 
actuators restrict the workspace and the limb displacement 
in a small region. Regarding this, a unique FPM with 3-
DOF based on multi-level displacement amplifier is 
designed for the potential application situations where large 
motion range is required in a micro- or nano- positioning 
environment. The proposed multi-level displacement 
amplifier based on a series of flexure hinges is integrated in 
each compliant limb as a monolithic structure which is 
driven by piezoelectric actuator.  
    The rest part of this paper is organized as follows: the 
conceptual designs and the kinematics modeling of the 
displacement amplifier and related planar/spatial flexure 
parallel micromanipulators are introduced Sections 2 and 3. 
In Section 4, the finite-element analysis is conducted to 
examine the static performance of the proposed FPM. Final 
section gives the conclusion.

amplifier is illustrated in Fig. 1. The piezoelectric actuator 
will be placed in the middle of the mechanism between the 
two convex stages connected to the inner bars. The four free 
lower/upper ends are attached to a fixed base. Through 
multi-stage amplification of the original displacement, large 
workspace of the end-effector can be achieved.

FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS  
    Finite element analysis (FEA) is a paramount method to 
test the performance of the flexure based compliant parallel 
manipulator. The different selection of materials also 
affects the practical characteristics. With a critical 
evaluation of design criteria based on various materials, 
stainless steel is chosen whose properties is described in

The resonant frequency of FPM can be utilized for its 
modal analysis. The classic sample of a mechanical 
resonance is a discrete system consisting of a mass attached 
to a spring with a constant force. The proposed FPM based 
on displacement amplifier is more complicated than a 
simple spring, which implies that it may contain more than 
one resonance frequency. Through simulation, it can be 
found in Fig. 7 that there are at least four resonance 
frequencies.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This research investigates on the conceptual design and 
performance analysis of a novel multi-level displacement 
amplifier based flexure parallel micromanipulator in which 
the stroke direction is perpendicular to the translation of the 
end-effector. The displacement amplifier is analyzed in 
macro and micro aspects. The finite element analysis proves 
the feasibility of the proposed design and it can be found 
that the proposed FPM has advantageous characteristics 
including high compliance, high linearity and high 
sensitivity. The proposed models and methods provide a 
new viewpoint for the development of compliant parallel 
micromanipulators. To eliminate the bending in undesired 
points, the improved symmetrical topology structures both 
in plane and in space will be developed for the future study. 
A physical prototype will be fabricated and tested. The 
experiments will be conducted to deeply explore the actual 
performances of the proposed design.
