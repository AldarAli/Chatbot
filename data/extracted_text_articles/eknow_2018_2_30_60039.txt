Abstract—This paper explores the possible interpretation of
’mass-in-mind,’ which describes a shift in a perceived challenge
due to experience. This work involves a measurement called
’game reﬁnement,’ which has been used to quantify the engage-
ment of a game. It establishes an incomplete link between real-
world physics and physics-in-mind, in which the acceleration and
the distance, also known as game progress, have been identiﬁed.
An existence of mass-in-mind, however, has just been established.
The mathematical model of mass-in-mind is constructed based
on the data interpretation, in which SCRABBLE matches between
computer players were analyzed. The results reveal a signiﬁcant
gap between prior models, which is explainable once the mass-
in-mind is considered.
Keywords–Scrabble; game reﬁnement theory; game progress
model; boardgame model; physics-in-mind.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Quantifying emotional excitement and mental engagement
in games is the subject of game reﬁnement theory [1]. Early
work in this direction has been carried out by Iida et al. [1]
while constructing a logistic model based on game outcome
uncertainty to measure the attractiveness and sophistication
of games [2]. Efforts have been devoted to the study of the
acceleration of the game progress [3], [4], [5]. The mass part
has just recently discussed [6], however, still remains unknown
even it has been one of the most fundamental concept in
classical mechanics [7].
SCRABBLE [8] has been played for several decades in
various situations [9], for instance, as a competitive match
between professional players [10], [11] or as a friendly match
among family members or students [12]. Different players
may have different vocabulary knowledge and supposed to
have distinct playing experience. Besides, players can play
SCRABBLE either for entertaining or educational purpose [12].
This paper focuses on an evaluation of SCRABBLE from the
game designer’s point-of-view, in which two original game
reﬁnement models are considered. However, the differences
are observed then being discussed.
The term ‘mass’ originally came from Latin word ‘Massa’,
which means accumulation, body, crowd or heap [13], [14].
Mass is one of the most fundamental concepts in both classical
and modern physics [7]. Initially, the notion of inertial mass
was brought to the consideration by Isaac Newton [15], [16].
The superﬁcial deﬁnition is the tendency of a body to resist
changes of acceleration. However, this might subject to mis-
interpretation in a case of modern physics [17]. The motion
of an object is indeterminable without the consideration of
mass [7]. Similarly, the acceleration of the game progress is
unobtainable without the mass-in-mind.
Earlier works in game reﬁnement theory successfully es-
tablished two mathematical models, known as the boardgame
model [1] and the game progress model [5], which corre-
spond to the boardgame and the scoring game respectively.
SCRABBLE, however, is the particular case where two models
are applicable. The results are compared, then lead to the
reconsideration of the precedent theory. This work is expected
to enhance the completeness of game reﬁnement theory and
become one of the standard assessment tools in the future.
The paper structure is as follows. In Section II, we describe
the brief history of the study of Game Reﬁnement Theory.
Section III explains the mass-in-mind concept, how it is
established and its affect to the mathematical model of game
reﬁnement. Section IV presents related prior works. Section V
presents the assessment and corresponding error from applying
the newly proposed model, thus discusses the results of the
analysis. Concluding remarks are given in Section VI.

SCRABBLE has been used as the main test-bed of this study.
It is a word anagram game which published in 1938 by Hasbro
[18], one of the famous toys game company in the United
States.
In opposition to a typical boardgame, SCRABBLE players
should possess not only strategic skill but also a sufﬁcient
vocabulary size. This is because they are required to form legit
words from randomly tiles given.
From earlier work [20], it is known that SCRABBLE pos-
sesses the stronger entertaining aspect compared to educational
aspect. While many players generally play SCRABBLE for
enjoyment purpose, only few players play it in an educational
way. By developing artiﬁcial intelligent player, the direction
to improve SCRABBLE is proposed using the feedback from
the artiﬁcial intelligence [21].
Superﬁcially,
SCRABBLE
might
be
considered
as
a
boardgame. However, it contains the aspect of competitive
scoring as well. Hence, we can observe the scoring rate,
branching factor, and game length. Those are essential for the
game progress model and the boardgame model of the game
reﬁnement measure.
II.
GAME REFINEMENT MEASURE
This section gives a short description of game reﬁnement
theory. A general model of game reﬁnement was proposed
based on the concept of the rate of change in game information
26

progress [5]. This model bridges a gap between boardgames
and scoring sports games.
A. Game Progress Model
The term ‘game progress’ is twofold. One criterion is
the game speed or scoring rate, while the other is game
information progress, which focuses on the game outcome.
Game information progress presents the degree of certainty of
the game’s results in time or steps. Having full information of
the game progress i.e., after its conclusion, game progress x(t)
will be given as a linear function of time t with 0 ≤ t ≤ tk
and 0 ≤ x(t) ≤ x(tk), as shown in (1).
x(t) = x(tk)
tk
t
(1)
However, the game information progress given by (1) is
unknown during the in-game period. The presence of uncer-
tainty during the game, often until the ﬁnal moments of a
game, reasonably renders game progress exponential. Hence,
a realistic model of game information progress is given by (2).
x(t) = x(tk)( t
tk
)n
(2)
Here n stands for a constant parameter, which is given
based on the perspective of an observer of the game that is
considered. Then the acceleration of the game information
progress is obtained by deriving (2) twice. Solving it for
t = tk, the equation becomes (3).
x′′(tk) = x(tk)
(tk)n tn−2 n(n − 1) |t=tk= x(tk)
(tk)2 n(n − 1)
(3)
It is assumed in the current model that game information
progress in any game is transported into and encoded in our
brains. We do not yet know about the physics of information
in the brain, but it is likely that the acceleration of information
progress is subject to the forces and laws of physics. Therefore,
we expect that the larger the value x(tk)
(tk)2 , the more exciting
the game becomes, due in part to the uncertainty of the game
outcome. Thus, we use its square root,
√
x(tk)
tk
, as a game
reﬁnement measure for the game under consideration. We call
it GR value for short, we also call x(tk) and tk G and T
respectively, as shown in (4).
GR =
√
G
T
(4)
The tendency of game reﬁnement theory has been ex-
plained in [22]. We consider the trend between game reﬁne-
ment theory and the player skill. While an increasing relation
leads to the entertaining experience, a decreasing relation leads
to the serious or educational experience. However, two above
ways may be utilized together to attract customers as shown
in a case of business [23].
B. Early Works with Scrabble
The swing model [20], a derivation of the game progress
model, is deﬁned to solve the nonidentical scoring system in
SCRABBLE. In this study, swing denotes a notion of phase

transition in mind from advantage to disadvantage and vice-
versa. Let DS be the dictionary size represented in the zero-
to-one normalized scale. The data are shown in Table I and
Figure 1.
Next, we compare the value of the two approaches, thus
display the observable difference. While the branching factor
grows with the dictionary size as expected, there is only slight
change in the number of swing occurrence and the game
length.
Since game reﬁnement theory has been used to quantify the
engagement of the game regardless of the type of the game,
we expected that the measures using two different approaches
are identical. However, this is not necessarily true in a case of
SCRABBLE.
The simple explanation is that the total branching factor
B is overwhelmingly excessive in the case of SCRABBLE.
Generally, SCRABBLE players cannot recognize all possible
instances to human limitations. They might not be able to
remember all the words in the standard dictionary or use them
efﬁciently within the limited time. In particular, we must take
the effective branching factor b into account. It was previously
introduced in [24].

The branching factor B represents a number of all possible
moves [1]. The effective branching factor b is the subset of the
branching factor B which contains only instances satisfyingly
perceived by a player [22]. The process to identify effective
solutions among all possible moves is involved with individual
skill. The generic single-step selection process is illustrated in
Figure 2.
III.
MASS-IN-MIND
A. Real-world Physics
In physics, kinetics is the branch of classical mechanics
regarding motion. Newton’s laws of motion [25], [26], [27],
[28] are three fundamental laws which describe the relationship
between forces acting upon a body, and its movement in
response to those, as shown in Law 1, Law 2 and Law 3.
More precisely, the ﬁrst law deﬁnes the force qualitatively, the
second law offers a quantitative measure of the force and the
third postulates that a single isolated force does not exist.
In this study, we mainly focus on the second law, which
describes the nature of mass, resistance to acceleration, or
inertia, when a net force is applied.
Law 1: Newton’s ﬁrst law In an inertial frame of refer-
ence, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at
a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an
external force.
Law 2: Newton’s second law In an inertial reference
frame, the vector sum of the forces F acting on an object
is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the
acceleration a of the object:
F = ma
(5)
It is assumed that the mass m is a constant.
Law 3: Newton’s third law When one body exerts a force
on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a
force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the ﬁrst
body.
B. Game Reﬁnement Theory Revisited
Although the study of the game reﬁnement measure and
the attempt to construct a link between real-world physics and
physics-in-mind has been made, currently only the acceleration
of the game progress is identiﬁed. However, mass, the essential
part of real-world physics is not yet mentioned.
SCRABBLE is a scoring game played on a board, so it
is the ﬁrst domain, which two different game reﬁnement
approaches are applicable. Once two procedures were applied
to SCRABBLE, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant gap between them,
then realized that there might be an inconsistency in the
original game reﬁnement measure.
C. Establishment of Mass-in-Mind
Different objects react differently to the same net force due
to their respective mass. For the same net force applied, an
object with a higher mass will have a lower acceleration. We
suppose that force-in-mind is the property of the game, and the
mass-in-mind is the property of the player, then acceleration-
in-mind is obtained by those two factors. Table II shows an
intended mapping between real-world physics and physics-in-
mind.

Intuition of a player
Based on the perception described above, the deﬁnition
of the mass-in-mind, or decision complexity perceived by a
player, is given in Deﬁnition 2.
Deﬁnition 1: Selection possibility p is given as a pro-
portion between selective instances which are satisfyingly
perceived and the entire.
Deﬁnition 2: Mass-in-mind m is the inversion of the
selection possibility of a player in a speciﬁc subject.
According to the deﬁnition given, we construct the math-
ematical model to make it more concretely for both game
progress model and the boardgame model. Considering a
boardgame, the possibility among a personal optimal selection
is
b
B , thus its inversion is B
b . In a case of the scoring game,
however, is not directly obtainable. Therefore, the approximate
model is introduced. By supposing that a player gets g scores
out of Σg total score at the endgame, one score has the
g
Σg possibility to be distributed to that player. Hence, the
selection possibility is obtained by
g
Σg, thus its inversion is
Σg
g . Table III summarizes the mathematical model of game
reﬁnement considering mass.

RELATED WORKS
This section presents prior works done in this direction.
How data is transferred within the human brain was explained
using physics [29]. As opposed to our Newtonian physics
analogy, the computational mechanism in the human brain is
explained by quantum physics and information theory.
The arrow which points from the past to the future, known
as the Time’s arrow, was introduced to explain the conscious-
ness and the awareness of the time. The time quantity used
in most physics equations dealing with events is measurable.
However, that is not necessarily equal to the time we sense. A
human is subjected to lose track of time when concentrating
on some medium.
In game reﬁnement theory, the uncertainty of the game
outcome is described with classical physics model. Game
reﬁnement measure reﬂects attractiveness of a game from the
viewpoint of designers. A game is enjoyable when its challenge
matches with preferences and skills of a player [30]. While
deﬁciency leads to a tiresomeness, an extreme difﬁculty may
lead to frustration. The high perceived challenge is one of the
conditions in ﬂow theory [31], which results in a loss of self-
consciousness and track of the time.

The study of the n(n − 1) in (3) is explained in [22] as
the C parameter. Cb and Cs are used for the boardgame and
the scoring game respectively. They are deﬁned in (6).
Cb = b

( 1

Through the effect of the C parameter, the acceleration part
of the game reﬁnement measure becomes (7)

(7)
The result shows a similarity with this study. According
to the mathematical formula, the Cb is as an inversion of
the mass-in-mind. Thus Rb is the exact value of the square
root of the acceleration from the boardgame model considering
the mass. However, the mass-in-mind of game progress model
does not share the same deﬁnition with Cs. Instead, it is likely
constant. This method could enhance the completeness of the
interpretation of the C parameter by redeﬁning Cs, which
would have some value, instead of being always 1.

ASSESSMENT AND DISCUSSION
We developed an artiﬁcial intelligent player to simulate
multiple SCRABBLE matches. A hundred of distinct match set-
tings are simulated with two hundred iterations each. Essential
data, including individual score, total score, branching factor,
game length were collected.
For the game progress model, we measure the individual
score of a winner side and a loser side separately because they
are obviously different. The data involving the force-in-mind
is given in Table IV. Then, the acceleration-in-mind of each
side are obtainable by considering their respective mass-in-
mind, as shown in Table V and Table VI. Hence, the average
is calculated and shown in Table VII and Figure 3.

For the boardgame model, the effective branching factor
is considered. It was suspected to be close to B and 1
for beginners and experts respectively. However, determining
the effective branching factor b for intermediate players is a
challenging question. We then introduce approximate models,
as shown in Table VIII.
Each approximate model is used with the boardgame model
considering mass. The comparative results with the game
progress model considering mass are shown in Figure 4.

CONCLUSION
Game reﬁnement theory has been used to assess the en-
gagement of a subject. Two earlier models, the game progress
model and the boardgame model have been used for the
scoring game and the typical boardgame respectively.
SCRABBLE, a game with a scoring system, which is played
on a board, is the primary concern of this study. Two earlier
models have been applied to this game. However, the signiﬁ-
cant difference has inspired us to investigate in particular and
strengthen the link between real-world physics and physics-in-
mind.
We revise game reﬁnement theory after an analogy between
real-world physics and physics-in-mind is considered, then
the deﬁnition of mass-in-mind is established. The concrete
mathematical model is constructed based on the type of the
subject that is examined. The Σg
g and B
b are introduced for the
scoring game and the boardgame respectively. Our study shows
that log B is a good approximation for b. After mass-in-mind
is brought into consideration, there is a small difference in the
measurement of the acceleration. The randomness of the raw
data and the rough approximation of the effective branching
factor b are possibly the cause of the apparent error.
In Newtonian mechanics, the concept of mass is based on
the self-object only. As opposed to that, mass-in-mind is not
just based on the player considered, but also on his experience
or skillfulness in that particular subject. In the case of the
boardgame, the effective branching factor b depends on the
branching factor B and the skill of the player. Professional
players tend to have a smaller b, which leads to a higher mass.
However, they will have a lower mass in a scoring game. Also,
the mass-in-mind of a winner is always less than that of a loser,
which leads to a higher acceleration a, which exposes more
emotional impact. This appearance is typical behavior as the
game usually is more enjoyable to the winner.
Although this paper focuses on the artiﬁcial intelligence
with perfect vocabulary knowledge, the proposed models ﬁt
well with the other cases, which is shown in Table XI.

In practice, mass-in-mind is not always a constant but
depends on various uncontrollable causes. For instance, current
mood and temper may affect the enjoyment of a game. Hence,
player may not have the same intuition while playing the same
game. We currently do not consider these factors and leave
them for future work.
After mass-in-mind is proposed, it is possible to discuss
later other physics-in-mind variables, for instance, energy-in-
mind and momentum-in-mind, which will enhance the com-
pleteness of our theory and the explanation of the phenomenon
of emotional impact.
Although the interpretation of mass-in-mind for the case
of a time-limited sport is not yet addressed in this paper, we

game progress model considering mass, which is

investigation and veriﬁcation are also left for future work.
