Abstract— Our proposed system utilizes Vehicle-to-Vehicle, 
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure, 
and 
Infrastructure-to-Vehicle 
communications to create a Visible Light Communication 
system for 
managing vehicles crossing light-controlled 
intersections in a safe manner. The system leverages connected 
vehicles and infrastructure to exchange information through 
the use of headlights, streetlights, and traffic signals. In this 
system, transmitters emit light signals that are encoded, 
modulated, and converted from data. Optical sensors with light 
filtering properties serve as receivers and decoders, allowing 
them to capture and interpret the transmitted signals. To 
facilitate effective communication, a specific communication 
scenario is established. Concurrently, an intersection manager 
takes charge of coordinating traffic flow and interacts with 
vehicles 
using 
embedded 
Driver 
Agents. 
The 
system 
incorporates a dynamic phasing diagram based on the total 
accumulated time to illustrate the concept. The collected data 
demonstrates that the adaptive traffic control system in the 
V2X environment can gather detailed information, including 
vehicle position, speed, queue length, and stopping time. By 
dynamically controlling traffic flows at intersections, the 
system adjusts the durations of cycles based on traffic 
demands. This improved temporal management of phases 
results in smoother traffic flow and higher average speeds.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The primary objective of Intelligent Transport System 
(ITS) technology is to enhance traffic safety and efficiency 
on public roads by increasing situational awareness and 
mitigating traffic accidents through vehicle-to-vehicle 
(V2V) 
and 
vehicle-to-infrastructure 
(V2I) 
communications[1] [2] [3]. Inefficiencies in existing traffic 
light cycle control systems lead to problems such as long 
delays and energy wastage. To address these issues and 
improve efficiency, it is crucial to utilize real-time traffic 
information as input and dynamically adjust the duration of 
traffic lights accordingly. The ultimate goal is to enhance 
safety and increase the throughput of traffic intersections 
through cooperative driving [4][5]. 
This research specifically focuses on utilizing Visible 
Light Communication (VLC) as a means of transmitting 
information to provide guidance services and specific 
information to drivers. The objective is to decide the 
duration of traffic signals based on the data collected from 
VLC data transmission. VLC is an emerging technology 
[ 6 ][ 7 ] that enables data communication by modulating 
information on the intensity of light emitted by LEDs. In the 
context of vehicular communications, VLC becomes more 
accessible as all vehicles, streetlights, and traffic lights are 
equipped with LEDs, which are primarily used for 
illumination. By utilizing streetlamps, traffic signals, and 
the headlights and taillights of vehicles, communication and 
localization can be facilitated, allowing for the dual use of 
exterior automotive and infrastructure lighting for both 
illumination and communication purposes[8][9]. After the 
introduction, 
Section 
II 
introduces 
the 
scenario, 
environment, and architecture for cooperative guidance 
systems. In Section III, a proposal for Dynamic Traffic 
Phasing is presented, followed by an analysis of the 
Adaptive V-VLC in Section IV. Sections V and VI establish 
a correlation between experimental and simulated results. 
Finally, Section VII encapsulates the main conclusions 
drawn from the study. 
A. Background Theory on Adaptive Traffic Control 
As wireless communication technologies advance and 
V2V and V2I systems, known as Connected Vehicles (CV), 
are developed, there arises an opportunity to optimize the 
operation of urban traffic networks through cooperation 
between traffic signal control and driving behaviors. The 
adaptive traffic control strategy we propose aims to 
effectively respond to real-time traffic demand by utilizing 
current and predicted future traffic flow data modeling. 
In comparison to the fixed coil detectors used in 
traditional traffic environments, the adaptive traffic control 
system in a V2X environment can collect more detailed

data. This includes not only traffic flow and occupancy 
information but also specific details such as vehicle 
position, speed, queuing length, and stopping time. By 
leveraging the capabilities of the V2X system, the adaptive 
traffic control system can gather comprehensive and 
granular data, providing a more accurate representation of 
the traffic situation [10][11]. This increased level of data 
granularity allows for more precise analysis and decision-
making in traffic control. It enables the adaptive traffic 
control system to dynamically adjust signal timings, 
optimize signal phasing, and coordinate traffic flow based 
on real-time conditions and predicted future demand. By 
incorporating the detailed data provided by the V2X 
environment, the adaptive traffic control system can 
improve traffic efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance 
overall urban traffic network performance. 
B. V-VLC Communication Link 
A Vehicular VLC system (V-VLC) comprises a 
transmitter that generates modulated light and a receiver 
located in infrastructures and driving cars to detect the 
received light variation. Both the transmitter and receiver 
are connected through the wireless channel. In this system, 
the light produced by the LED is modulated using ON-OFF-
keying (OOK) amplitude modulation [12]. The environment 
is defined by a cluster of square unit cells arranged in an 
orthogonal geometry. Different data channels are provided 
by tetra-chromatic white light (WLEDs) sources positioned 
at the corners of the square unit cells[13][14]. 
The input of the V-VLC system consists of coded signals 
sent by transmitters such as streetlights and headlights. 
These signals are intended to communicate with identified 
vehicles (I2V), traffic lights (V2I), or other vehicles (V2V). 
The input also includes the position of transmitters in the 
network and the steering angle (δ) to guide the driver's 
orientation along their path. To manage the passage of 
vehicles crossing the intersection, queue/request/response 
mechanisms and temporal/space relative pose concepts are 
employed. The coded signals are received and decoded by a 
PINPIN photodetector with light filtering properties. 
C. Intelligent control system 
In order to develop an intelligent control system model 
that 
facilitates 
safe 
vehicle 
management 
through 
intersections using V2V, V2I, and I2V communications, 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts are utilized. RL is a 
training method that involves rewarding desired behaviors 
and/or punishing undesired ones [15] [16]. The simulations 
are agent-based and are conducted using a tool for 
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) [17]. As the agent 
gains experience, it learns to avoid negative situations and 
focus on positive ones. The traffic lights in SUMO are 
controlled by the learning agent based on its decisions, and 
the overall flow of traffic is described while rewarding the 
actions of the traffic lights control agent. The agent's goal is 
to explore new states while maximizing its total reward to 
develop the best possible policy. A dynamic phasing 
diagram and a matrix of states based on the total 
accumulated time are presented to illustrate the concept.

Fig. 1. Simulated scenario with the optical infrastructure (Xij), the 
generated footprints (1-9), the CV and the environment. 
Based on clusters of square unit cells, an orthogonal 
topology was considered. Each transmitter, X i,j, carries its 
own color, X, (Red, Green, Blue, Violet) as well as its 
horizontal and vertical ID position in the surrounding 
network (i,j). During the Proof of Concept (PoC), it was 
assumed that the crossroads are located at the intersections 
of line 4 with column 3 and column 11, respectively. In 
Figure 1, four traffic flows were considered. Twenty-four 
vehicles arriving from West (W): twenty red ai Vehicles 
with straight movement and four yellow ci Vehicles with 
left turn only. In the second flow green Vehicles from East 
(E) bi approach the intersection with left turn only (thirteen 
straight and two left turn). In the third flow, six orange ei 
Vehicles, oncoming from South (S), two have left-turn 
approach and four straight movement. Finally, in the fourth 
flow, thirteen blue fi Vehicles coming from North, nine go 
straight and four have left turn in both intersections. Road 
request and response segments, offer a binary (turn left / 
straight or turn right) choice. According to the simulated 
scenario, each car represents a percentage of traffic flow. It 
is assumed that a1, b1, and a2, make up the top three 
requests, followed by b2, a3, and c1 in fourth, fifth and sixth 
place, respectively. In seventh, eighth and nineth request 
places are b3, e1 and a3, respectively, followed in tenth place, 
by c2. In penultimate request is a5, and in the last one is f1. 
According to our assumptions, 540 cars approach the 
intersection per hour, of which 80 percent come from east 
and west. Then, 50% of cars will turn left or right at the 
intersection and the other 50% will continue straight. 
In the proposed system, a mesh cellular hybrid structure 
is utilized, as depicted in Figure 2. The "mesh" controller, 
situated at the streetlights, plays the role of forwarding 
messages to vehicles (I2V) within the mesh. It functions 
similar to router nodes in a network, facilitating 
communication between vehicles. On the other hand, the 
"mesh/cellular" hybrid controller acts as a border-router and

can also be employed for edge computing. This hybrid 
architecture allows for edge computing and device-to-cloud 
communication 
(I2IM), 
enabling 
the 
exchange 
of 
information. It leverages embedded computing platforms to 
perform a significant portion of processing tasks, while 
directly interfacing with sensors and controllers. This 
approach supports geo-distribution, local decision making, 
and real-time load balancing. By utilizing the mesh cellular 
hybrid structure, the system can effectively process and 
analyze data at the edge, enabling quicker response times 
and reducing the burden on central cloud infrastructure. 
Furthermore, 
this 
architecture 
promotes 
peer-to-peer 
communication (I2I), enabling direct information exchange 
between 
vehicles. 
This 
peer-to-peer 
communication 
enhances the efficiency of data sharing and collaboration 
among vehicles in the network.

Emitters (street lights) are located along the roadside 
(Figure 1). Thus, each LED sends an I2V message that 
includes the synchronism, its physical ID and the traffic 
information. When a probe vehicle enters the streetlight´s 
capture range, the receiver replies to the light signal, and 
assigns a unique ID and a traffic message [15]. When 
approaching the intersection, it asks permission “request” to 
cross. An IM acknowledge is sent, “response” from the 
traffic signal over the facing receiver to the in-car 
application of the head vehicle. Once the response is 
received (message distance), the vehicle is required to 
follow the provided occupancy trajectories (footprint 
regions, see Figure 1). If a request has any potential risk of 
collision with all other vehicles that have already been 
approved to cross the intersection, the control manager only 
sends back to the vehicle (V2I) the “response” after the risk 
of conflict is exceeded. The vehicle speed can be calculated 
by measuring the actual travelled distance overtime, using 
the ID´s transmitters tracking, qi(x,y,t). For a vehicle with 
several neighboring vehicles, the mesh node uses the 
indirect V2V relative pose estimations, qij(t) method taking 
advantage of the data of each neighboring vehicle [18]. 
III. 
DYNAMIC TRAFFIC SIGNAL PHASING  
Existing inefficient traffic light cycle control causes 
numerous problems, such as long delay and waste of energy. 
The traffic signal duration will be based on the collected 
data from V2V, V2I and I2V VLC communication. The 
traffic controller uses queue, request and response messages, 
from the ai, bi, ci, ei and fi vehicles, fusing the self-
localizations qi (t) with their space relative poses qij (t) to 
generate phase durations appropriate to accommodate the 
demand on each cycle. The following parameters are 
therefore needed to model the queuing system: The initial 
arrival time (t0) and velocity (v0) in each the occupied 
section. The initial time is defined as the time when the 
vehicles leave the previous section (queue, request or 
message distances) and move along the next section, qi (t, 
t’). The service time is calculated using vehicle speed and 
distance of the section. The number of service units or 
resources is determined by the capacity of the section, n(qi 
(x,y, , t))  and vehicle speed which depends on the number 
of request services, and on the direction of movement along 
the lane   qi (x, y, , t). The maximum number of possible 
vehicles in the message distance is 4 by lane and 8 by route.  
So, a maximum of 32 vehicles are expected at the message 
distances (20 m) based on the stipulated average vehicle 
length (4.5 m). It was assumed that ta1<tb1<ta2<tb2<ta3<tc1 
<tb3<te<ta4<tc2<ta5<tf. To each driving Vehicle, xi, is 
assigned the unique time at which it must enter the 
intersection, t’’[xi].

sequences (states). The states marked with * are dynamic 
movable states that depends on the traffic demand during 
the cycle. The exclusive pedestrian phase contains the “0”, 
the “1” and the “16” sequences. The cycle's top 
synchronism starts with sequences "1". The first, second, 
third, and fourth phases contain sequences between "2" and 
"15" and control traffic flow. The PoC assumes that all the 
leaders approach the intersection with similar velocities at 
different times (Figure 3b). Vehicle a1 was the first to 
request to cross the intersection and informed IM about its 
position and also that four others follow it at their positions 
with their speeds. Phase 1, sequence 3, therefore, begins at 
t'a1. Vehicle b1 requests access later and includes the 
mappings of its two followers in its request. As the order to 
cross conflicts with ai movement, he and his followers will 
pile up on the stop line increasing the total waiting time of 
the bi cars. The fourth sequence is an adaptive sequence. 
Due to the presence of a medium E-W traffic scenario, the 
IM extends the green time in order to accommodate the 
passage of all the ai followers as well as the simultaneous 
passage of the arriving ci .  
From the capacity point of view, it is more efficient, if 
Vehicle c1 is given access (Phase 2) before Vehicles bi, and 
Vehicle c2 is given access before Vehicle e, forming a west 
left turn of set of vehicles (platoon) before giving way to the 
fourth phase with north and south conflicting flows. 
Meanwhile, the speed of Vehicle e was reduced, increasing 
the total accumulated time, rt,  in the S-N arm. Adaptive 
sequences 8 and 9 kick off Phase 3 and the sequence times 
will be adjusted according to the variation of waiting 
accumulated times for the left turn of the bi cars. A new 
phase, Phase 4, begins and includes two adaptive sequences, 
sequence 12 and 13 also dependent on the accumulated 
waiting times of the N-S arms. Their time intervals will be 
as short as possible, which will free up capacity in the cycle 
for the E-W flows that are heavily loaded. Taking into 
account the accumulated total waiting time in each arm an 
85-second cycle is recommended for this type of flow. The 
times associated with each sequence can be visualized in 
Figure 3. 
IV. 
V-VLC ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC CONTROL  
To code the information, an On-Off keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used, and it was considered a 
synchronous transmission based on a 64- bits data frame. 
Each infrastructure is equipped with white tetrachromatic 
LEDs, making it possible to transmit four signals 
simultaneously. So, all that is needed is a receiver that 
actively filters each of the channels, and a four-fold increase 
in bandwidth is possible. Each of the RGBV signals sent has 
calibrated amplitude that defines it. Because each VLC 
infrastructure has four independent emitters, the optical 
signal generated in the receiver can have one, two, three, or 
even four optical excitations, resulting in 24 different optical 
combinations and 16 different photocurrent levels at the 
photodetector [15]. Filtering is achieved by the PINPIN 
demultiplexer, which receives the combined OOK signal 
and through prior knowledge of the calibrated amplitudes is 
able to decode the sent message.  As an example, in in 
Figure 4 Vehicle c1 (Figure 1), receives three MUX signals 
as it crosses the intersection during Phase2.This vehicle, 
driving on the left lane (#8 E), was the sixth to ask 
permission to cross the intersection it receives order to enter 
the intersection in pose # 8E, turns left (#1NE) and keeps 
moving in this direction across position #1 toward the North 
exit (#4N). In the right side, the received channels are 
identified by its 4-digit binary codes and associated 
positions in the unit cell. On the top the transmitted 
channels packets [R, G, B, V] are decoded. The 
environment is also inserted to guide the eyes.

The insert visualizes the environment. 
As exemplified in the top part of Figure 4, the frame is 
divided into several blocks. The first block is the 
synchronization block. The synchronism always considers 
the same sequence of bits for all transmitters in a pattern 
[10101], having as a second purpose the identification of the 
maximum possible amplitude at reception. By knowing the 
maximum amplitude received it is possible to identify the 
footprint region [15]. With this information and with the 
help of the calibration signal, the location of the vehicle in 
its cell is defined. The next two blocks, gives the location (x, 
y coordinates) of the emitters inside the array (Xi,j,). Cell’s 
IDs are encoded using a 4 bits binary representation for the 
decimal number. The  block (steering angle ()) completes 
the pose in a frame time q(x,y, , t). Eight coded steering

angles along the cardinal points gives the car direction. The 
next block (R) identifies the message type, which can be a 
“request” [00], a “response” [01] or another message type. 
The Flag (F) is a bit indicating whether there is vehicle 
identification in the following bits or not. Its purpose is to 
alert the decoder that the following bit sequence 
corresponds to the vehicle identification rather than the 
payload. ID block is the temporary identification of the 
vehicle, decided and provided by the infrastructure on the 
“response” message and order the request message at the 
intersection. Here, 5 bits are considered because a maximum 
of 32 vehicles per lane (8 routes, 4 lanes) are expected at 
message distance (20 m).  The last is the traffic message. It 
is the body of the message, and may include other 
information such as the road condition, average-waiting 
time, and weather conditions, among others. EoF Bit or 
sequence of bits defines the end of the frame. In this case, 
the sequence [0110] was considered. 
V. 
DYNAMIC TRAFFIC FLOW CONTROL SIMULATION 
The considered environment for SUMO simulation (Figure 
1), is a 4-way intersection, 2 lanes on each arm approach the 
intersection from compass directions, leaving 2 lanes on 
each arm. Each arm is 100 meters long. On every arm, each 
lane defines the directions that a vehicle can follow. In both 
intersections, a traffic light system, controlled by the IM 
(also known as agent), manages the approaching traffic. 
Figure 5, illustrates the state representation for the west 
arm of the intersections at specific time points. Each lane 
has a dedicated traffic light labeled TL/0-15. The state 
representation segregates the arm into discrete "response", 
"request", and "queue" cells. In total, there are 4 cells 
(0/message, 1/request, 2,3/queues) per lane (L/0-7), 
resulting in a total of 32 state cells during the simulation. 
During the simulation, an array contains information 
about all vehicles present at a given time, with states 
assigned to them. The state of a vehicle, denoted as "vi," 
where i represent the order of the crossing request, consists 
of a two-digit string. The first digit represents the lane the 
vehicle is in, while the second digit represents its position 
within that lane. For example, the state of the leader vehicle 
a1 in lane L0 would be represented as v1="00", and the state 
of the leader vehicle b1 in lane L4 would be represented as 
v2="50".

Fig. 5. State representation for the west arm of the intersections.  Traffic 
Lights’ (TL; 0-15), Lanes (L ;1-7.) Agent states (st) representation. 
The training process is divided into multiple episodes, 
typically exceeding 100 episodes. Actions (Figure 3a) are 
performed when the traffic light system activates a set of 
lanes for a predetermined time during green phases. The 
yellow phase lasts four seconds, while the green phase lasts 
eight seconds. If the current action matches the previous 
action, there is no yellow phase, and the current green phase 
continues. However, if the current action differs from the 
previous one, a 4-second yellow phase occurs between the 
two actions. The reward, denoted as r, represents the 
environment's response to the agent's decision. The reward 
is based on a traffic efficiency metric, allowing the agent to 
assess whether the action taken improves or hampers 
intersection efficiency. In the presented scenario (Figure 1), 
the IM receives access requests to the intersection from 
leading vehicles at different times (tx1, Figure 3). This V2I 
information provides the IM with precise location and speed 
data of all leading vehicles, as well as the location and speed 
of their followers obtained through V2V communication. 
This data helps the IM anticipate the initial arrival times and 
speeds at various sections, facilitating traffic coordination.

As far as circulation is concerned, the vehicles are all 
moving at an average of 10 m/s, dropping the speed to 5 m/s 
when reaching the traffic light at the beginning of the cycle, 
during 
pedestrian 
eviction. 
Considering 
this 
speed, 
approximately three seconds of green light are estimated to 
be required for each vehicle to drive through the traffic 
light. Taking into account Figure 1 a state diagram resulting 
from the SUMO simulation was generated and presented in 
Figure 7. Essentially, the result demonstrates the feasibility 
and benefit of creating a dynamic system that adapts to 
specific traffic scenarios. It is important to improve the 
coding techniques, in the future, in order to allow only the 
legitimate receivers to process secure request/response

CONCLUSIONS  
The integration of V-VLC  technology with connected 
cars has optimized the operation of urban traffic networks 
by combining traffic signal control with driving behavior. A 
queue/request/response approach is employed for managing 
intersections, facilitated by V-VLC communications. This 
system enables real-time monitoring of queues, requests, 
and messages, along with the synchronization of traffic 
routing in different routes based on travel times. 
To demonstrate the concept, architecture, scenario, and 
environment were developed. A phasing diagram is 
proposed to illustrate the traffic control process. A 
simulation using an urban mobility simulator was 
conducted, showcasing the benefits of adaptive traffic 
control. For future work, expanding upon this study could 
involve refining the developed architecture, scenario, and 
environment, further validating the proposed phasing 
diagram's efficacy in real-world traffic control, and 
exploring advanced simulation techniques to delve deeper 
into the advantages of adaptive traffic control.
