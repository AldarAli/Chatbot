Abstract—Measuring 
the 
continuous 
improvement 
of 
Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) is often 
neglected as most organizations do not know how to extract key-
indicators that could be used for this purpose. The underlying 
work presents a six-level maturity model which can be fully 
integrated in a risk management tool and helps to define key 
indicators for measuring the improvement of an ISMS. 
Furthermore, the proposed model establishes on how far the 
increase of maturity can help to mitigate information security 
risks and finally, a cost-benefit equation is presented which can 
be used to quantitatively justify the increase of maturity of an 
ISMS and to establish an action plan increasing the maturity.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The need to set up an Information Security Management 
System (ISMS) in organizations that treat critical or sensitive 
information is growing. Constantly new vulnerabilities, 
exploits and threats express the necessity to set up a managed 
system that is perfectly adapted to the fast evolving 
information 
and 
communications 
technology 
(ICT) 
environment. 
One major difficulty of an ISMS is on how to measure its 
efficiency, quality or more generically its maturity. By 
considering the fact that an ISMS is based on continuous 
improvement, it is important to measure its maturity 
evolution. The maturity level of an ISMS can be used as a key 
indicator by Information Security Managers to monitor its 
efficiency and improvement. For example, young ISMS with 
low maturity often show similar deficits, such as non-
formalized processes or security instructions, untested 
security procedures or unverified security statements. 
A key element of an ISMS that follows the international 
standard ISO/IEC 27001 [1] is the periodic assessment of risks 
that includes identification of vulnerabilities, threats as well as 
estimation of their probability of occurrence and possible 
impact. During a risk analysis, the organization establishes an 
overview of currently implemented security controls and sets 
up an action plan to counteract non-acceptable risks. The aim 
of the underlying work is to introduce a maturity model that is 
part of the risk analysis process with the objective to 
determine the maturity level of security controls, the effect of 
missing maturity on risks and cost of increasing maturity. 
Finally, this model allows to define a risk treatment plan 
combining actions to increase security and actions to increase 
maturity. 
To prove that the security maturity model can be adapted 
to its context, the model has been tested for a small to medium-
sized enterprise (SME). 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents related work considered for developing the security 
maturity model. Section III describes the security maturity 
model. Section IV introduces the concept of the return on 
security maturity investment. Section V closes the paper with 
the conclusion and outlook on further work.

RELATED WORK 
Several Maturity Models exist for determining the quality 
of organizational processes. Two common models (Capability 
Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) [2] and ISO/IEC 15504 
– 
Software 
Process 
Improvement 
and 
Capability 
Determination (SPICE) [3]) have been analyzed to collect 
valuable information that could be reused for the setup of a 
Maturity model related to Information Security. 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) developed an IT Security Maturity Model, including 
several maturity levels and related tasks [4]. These 
standardized tasks have been reused and partly adapted to fit 
to the Security Maturity Model described in this paper. 
Furthermore, there have already been first tries of 
including 
maturity 
in 
risk 
assessment 
tools 
[5-6]. 
Unfortunately, in those tools, maturity is not handled as an 
evolution indicator but rather as a substitute for indicating the 
implementation rate of security controls or as a generic and 
qualitative indicator with no further details on how maturity is 
measured. 
Finally, the quantitative computations that are made to 
compute the cost-effectiveness of increasing Security 
Maturity are based on the mathematical models used by the 
risk assessment methods ISAMM [7] and TRICK Service [8].

SECURITY MATURITY MODEL 
The elaborated security maturity model is based on a 
multi-level approach (Section III.A.) with associated Maximal 
Efficiency Rates (Section III.B.) having a direct influence on 
the estimated implementation rates of current security 
controls. This direct influence of maturity levels on the 
implementation rate of security controls allows establishing a

link between security maturity and the assessment of the 
overall information security status of an organization. 
A. Security Maturity Levels (SML) 
The elaborated security maturity model contains six levels 
with associated tasks that have to attain a predefined 
implementation rate before a higher level can be reached. 
The tasks are categorized into five different domains: 
“Policies” (Pol), “Procedures” (Pro), “Implementation” 
(Imp), “Test” (Tes) and “Integration” (Int). Every task aims to 
cover a different aspect of security maturity. The tasks and the 
different maturity levels are based on the standard NISTIR 
7358 [4]. However, the tasks have been reorganized to create 
an interdependency of the tasks, so that it should not be 
possible to reach a high SML without fulfilling the tasks of the 
lower SML’s. 
In the following, the six SML’s and their associated tasks 
will be presented. 
Security Maturity Level 0: Incomplete - No specific 
tasks available for Security Maturity Level 0, which is reached 
by default. The associated security controls are quite 
superficially implemented, typically by a small ISMS team 
which does not show any systematic approach. 
Security Maturity Level 1: Performed - Pol 1: Formal, 
up-to-date documented policies exist and are readily available 
to employees; Imp 1: Procedures are communicated to 
individuals who are required to follow them; Pro 1: Formal, 
up-to-date, 
documented 
procedures 
are 
provided 
to 
implement the security controls identified by the defined 
policies; Tes 1: Tests are routinely conducted to evaluate the 
adequacy and effectiveness of all implementations. 
Security Maturity Level 2: Managed - Pol 2: Policies 
establish a continuing cycle of assessing risk and 
implementation 
and 
uses 
monitoring 
for 
program 
effectiveness; Imp 2: Information security procedures and 
controls are implemented in a consistent manner everywhere 
the procedure applies and are reinforced through training; Pro 
2: Procedures clarify where the procedure is to be performed, 
how the procedure is to be performed, when the procedure is 
to be performed, who is to perform the procedure, and on what 
the procedure is to be performed; Tes 2: Tests ensure that all 
policies, procedures, and controls are acting as intended and 
that they ensure the appropriate information security level. 
Security Maturity Level 3: Established - Pol 3: Policies 
are written to cover all major facilities in scope; Imp 3: Ad hoc 
approaches that tend to be applied on an individual or a case-
by-case basis are discouraged; Pro 3: Procedures clearly 
define Information security responsibilities and expected 
behaviors for (1) asset owners and users, (2) information 
resources management and data processing personnel, (3) 
management, and (4) Information security administrators; Tes 
3: Effective corrective actions are taken to address identified 
weaknesses, including those identified as a result of potential 
or actual information security incidents or through 
information security alerts issued by national Computer 
Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) or Computer 
Emergency Response Teams (CERT). 
Security Maturity Level 4: Predictable - Pol 4: Policies 
are approved by key affected parties; Pro 4: Procedures 
contain appropriate individuals to be contacted for further 
information, guidance, and compliance; Tes 4: Self-
assessments, a type of test that can be performed by company 
staff, by contractors, or others engaged by company 
management, are routinely conducted to evaluate the 
adequacy and effectiveness of all implementations; Tes 5: 
Independent audits are an important check on company 
performance, but are not to be viewed as a substitute for 
evaluations initiated by company management; Tes 6: 
Information gleaned from records of potential and actual 
Information security incidents and from security alerts, such 
as those issued by software vendors are considered as test 
results. Such information can identify specific vulnerabilities 
and provide insights into the latest threats and resulting risk. 
Security Maturity Level 5: Optimized - Int 1: Policies, 
procedures, implementations, and tests are continually 
reviewed and improvements are made; Pol 5: Policies 
delineate the information security management structure, 
clearly assign Information security responsibilities, and lay 
the foundation necessary to reliably measure progress and 
compliance; Pol 6: Policies identify specific penalties and 
disciplinary actions to be used if the policy is not followed; 
Pro 5: Procedures document the implementation of and the 
rigor in which the control is applied; Tes 7: Evaluation 
requirements, including requirements regarding the type and 
frequency of testing, are documented, approved, and 
effectively implemented; Tes 8: The frequency and rigor with 
which individual controls are tested depend on the risks that 
will be posed if the controls are not operating effectively. 
B. Security Maturity Parameters 
The following section presents the key parameters of the 
developed security maturity model. All parameters are 
customizable and can be fine-tuned according to the 
specificities of the organization in focus. 
1) Implementation Scale for Security Maturity Tasks. 
This section defines a scale for measuring the 
implementation rate of the different security maturity tasks. 
The implementation scale includes five different levels as

2) Task Overview per Security Maturity Level 
Each SML has related tasks which have to attain a 
predefined implementation rate in order to pretend that the 
SML is reached. The following list exemplary shows the 6 
SML’s 
and 
the 
related 
tasks 
with 
their 
required 
implementation rates: 
SML 0:  Reached by default – no tasks have to be fulfilled. 
SML 1:  Pol1, Pro 1, Imp 1, and Tes 1 have to be largely 
achieved 
SML 2:  In addition to SML 1, Pol 2, Pro 2, Imp 2, and Tes 
2 have to be largely achieved 
SML 3:  In addition to SML 2, Pol 3, Pro 3, Imp 3, and Tes 
3 have to be largely achieved 
SML 4:  In addition to SML 3, Pol 4, Pro 4, Tes 4, Tes 5, 
and Tes 6 have to be largely achieved 
SML 5: All tasks have to be fully achieved 
3) Maximal Efficiency Rate 
By looking at the previous sections, it is possible to 
conclude that the higher the reached SML the higher the 
efficiency of the security treatment in the organization. Hence, 
a fully implemented security control cannot be fully efficient 
if the associated SML is not the highest possible. 
In order to include these reflections in a risk assessment 
approach, we introduce the notion of Maximal Efficiency 
Rates (MaxEffRate) associated with the different SML’s (see 
Table II below). 
With the help of collected data during the case study with 
the SME, the different Maximal Efficiency Rates of Security 
Maturity Levels can be fine-tuned. 
TABLE II.

The now determined MaxEffRate per SML can be used to 
calculate the implementation rate of a security control taking 
into account the SML. For example, this allows to model the 
fact that a security control can be fully implemented but only 
have a small efficiency, if the associated SML is low. 
The following formula is used to calculate an improved 
implementation rate of a security control taking security 
maturity into account, called the Maturity-based Effectiveness 
Rate (MER): 
 
MER = IR * MaxEffRateSMLi 
(1) 
where 
 
MER= (Maturity-based Effectiveness Rate) be the 
improved implementation rate of the security control 
in focus taking Security Maturity into account; 
 
IR=the current implementation rate of the security 
control; 
 
MaxEffRateSMLi be the maximal efficiency rate of the 
current Security Maturity Level (SMLi). 
Example: For the considered SME, we determined that a 
security control called “Implement an antivirus solution for 
every system in use” has been applied to 50%. The SML of 
the antivirus control is 3 because all requirements of SML 3 
have been fulfilled (e.g., validated policy in place, requiring 
the implementation of antivirus solutions) but some tasks of 
SML 4 are still not satisfied (e.g., no audit was done to verify 
the well-functioning of the antivirus solution). Thus we have 
for the antivirus control an implementation rate (IR) of 50%, 
and a MaxEffRate of 70% which gives a MER of 
50%*70%=35% for the antivirus security control. 
This example demonstrates that if the maturity of the 
ISMS in focus has not reached the highest level, the 
implemented security controls cannot be fully efficient. This 
conclusion is not astonishing as we can pretend that if for 
example policies, procedures, implementations, and tests are 
not continually reviewed and no improvements are made (see 
Task Int 1 of SML5), the underlying security controls cannot 
be fully efficient. 
Figure 1 illustrates the impact of Security Maturity on the 
implementation rate of a security control where Security 
Maturity is taken into account. The figure shows the SME-
tailored model.

controls (MaxEffRate tailored to SME use-case) 
IV. 
RETURN ON SECURITY MATURITY INVESTMENT 
(ROSMI) 
The introduced maturity model offers the possibility to 
compute the Return On Security Maturity Investment 
(ROSMI) which can be used to justify the costs resulting from 
the resources to invest for implementing the tasks to increase 
the security maturity (resources are needed to fulfill the 
different tasks presented in Section III.A.). 
The ROSMI is based on the Return on Investment (ROI) 
and Return On Security Investment (ROSI) concepts [7], [9-
10], which consist of investing a certain amount of money 
with the aim to reduce the risk and such in return save more 
money than initially invested. This risk reduction is expressed 
as the difference of the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) 
before, and the ALE after implementing security controls. 
The ROSMI, when raising the current SML to the SML 
above (𝑅𝑂𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1), is expressed as the difference between 
 
297

the ALE reductions generated by the raise of the current SML 
(∆𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1) and the costs incurring by the increase of the 
SML (𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1): 
𝑅𝑂𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1 = ∆𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1 − 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1 
 
 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 4 
(2) 
The ALE Reduction (∆𝐴𝐿𝐸) emerging from the raise of 
the current SML (∆𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1) is based on the quantitative 
risk assessment method, ISAMM [7] and TRICK Service [8]. 
The first step consists in computing the ALE reduction of 
every security control based on the increase of the current 
SML (∆𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑀,𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1): 
∆𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑀,𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1 = 𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑒𝑀,𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖 ∗ 𝑅𝑅𝐹𝑀 ∗ 𝑒𝑀 ∗ 
(𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖+1−𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖)
1−𝑅𝑅𝐹𝑀∗𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖∗𝑒𝑀
  𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 4 
(3)
The risk reduction factor of a security control M (𝑅𝑅𝐹𝑀) is 
introduced in the TRICK Service methodology [8] and 
represents a factor which indicates the impact of a security 
control on the risk exposure of an asset. 
The second step consists in summing all ∆ALE of the 
security controls to get the general ALE reduction resulting 
from the raise of the current SML: 
∆𝐴𝐿𝐸 𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1 = ∑
𝑀 ∆𝐴𝐿𝐸𝑀,𝑆𝑀𝐿𝑖→𝑖+1
 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 4 
The resulting ALE reduction gives a clear indication of the 
influence that the increase of maturity has on risks that a 
company is facing to and can be used for the ROSMI 
computation. 
V. 
USE CASE 
The underlying maturity model has been applied in the 
context of a risk analysis for an SME offering trusted third 
party services. During the risk assessment, the current 
implementation levels of ISO/IEC 27002 security controls 
have been estimated and the current SML of each ISO/IEC 
27002 chapter has been computed by determination of the 
implementation rate of the SML related tasks. Based on the 
now identified SML per ISO/IEC 27002 chapter, it was 
possible to compare the current implementation rate with the 
MER. Some chapters showed a high implementation rate but 
low maturity and revealed the need of incrementing the SML 
of the different ISO/IEC 27002 chapters to get more efficient 
security controls having a better mitigation effect on the 
current risk level of the SME. 
The next step consisted in getting an idea about what 
security maturity tasks to implement first for getting the best 
effect on the MER of the security controls. For doing so, the 
workload for implementing the security maturity tasks has 
been estimated. These information were used as input to 
compute a prioritized action plan by using the ROSMI 
formula, showing which tasks to implement first to get the 
best effect on the effectiveness of the ISO/IEC 27002 security 
controls. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
This work demonstrated that the maturity of an 
implemented ISMS can be used as a key-indicator with which 
it is possible to assess the effectiveness of security controls. 
Increasing the maturity of an ISMS can by itself be seen 
as a security control that is used to improve the current 
security level of an organization. 
Furthermore, the presented maturity model enables to 
illustrate the evolution of information security in an 
organization and can be used as a basis for taking decisions, 
related to the continuous improvement of an ISMS. 
Finally, the elaborated concept that is already part of the 
risk assessment tool TRICK Service, now has to be applied 
for further organizations in order to setup an knowledge base 
with which it will be possible to adapt the MaxEffRates (see 
Section III.B.2) to the different types of organizations and 
proof the feasibility of the tasks related to the different SML’s. 
It is planned to prove the concept for critical infrastructures in 
the context of further research projects.
