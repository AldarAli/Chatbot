Abstract - This paper explores the vulnerability of social 
network users to identity theft when they share personal 
identification information online. The sharing of details like age, 
sex, address and other personal information like photographs 
can assist in establishing an identity. Identity criminals exploit 
social network users and the weaknesses of social networking 
sites to gather the information needed to commit identity theft 
and identity fraud using this identification information. While 
there are mechanisms that can reduce the incidence of this 
crime, information sharing on social networks is voluntary, 
which, makes its control difficult. This paper presents an 
exploration of existing literature from Australia, the United 
States and United Kingdom and highlights the importance of the 
relationship between social networking and identity crime. The 
drivers to sharing information on these platforms are 
considered. The paper provides opportunities to improve the 
understanding of the relationship between personal information 
and the crime. A difficulty in having preventative mechanisms 
in place is that social networking sites have a vested interest in 
promoting rather than preventing the sharing of information. 
Further, identity crime is pervasive which, makes the 
amelioration of risks difficult. In conclusion, efforts have been 
made in this paper to outline arguments that will assist in 
resolving the crime given vulnerability of social network users 
to identity theft.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Social networking has inspired computer users to share 
information online. Social networking sites bring together 
people with common interests and they enable mass social 
interaction [1]. This mechanism of communication overcomes 
geographical constraints and can bring together disparate 
groups [2]. Social networking is attractive due to its social 
inclusiveness [3] as well as its interactive nature [4]. For 
example, over 500 million people have used Facebook to 
create profiles to express themselves across this social 
networking platform [5]. Facebook is the most popular social 
networking site, followed by Myspace according to college 
students in the United States [6]. The social linkages these 
platforms create are particularly attractive to these users [7]. 
Many of the new innovative forms of communication are 
accompanied by new ways of accepting and exploiting this 
interaction. Acceptance of these new ways of interaction 
expands social connections between people, but this 
communication can be exploited, leading to something far 
more sinister: identity crimes. 
This paper considers why identity crime is serious in the 
context of the strong uptake of social networking. The basis 
of the discussion is around literature obtained from the United 
States, United Kingdom and Australia. The paper then 
discusses the responses to identity crime in social networking 
including the suitability of criminal law and privacy 
responses to this crime. Thereafter the paper discusses the 
international dimensions to dealing with identity crime in 
social networking and provides some recommendations and 
foreshadows future work.

RELATED WORK 
 
The extent that individuals share information on a social 
networking site is determined by the decisions they make and 
are influenced by many behavioral drivers. The control 
mechanism used on social networking sites is typically the 
user privacy settings, which, allows an individual to determine 
the visibility of their profile to others. Most users tend to leave 
these at the default setting established by the social 
networking provider, which, may be less than optimal to the 
end user of these services in respect of privacy [8]. A social 
networking profile is how the social networking users 
represent themselves online and it facilitates their presence 
and disseminates information about them and this is at the 
heart of social networking [9]. The opportunity to share 
information is attractive to users who aspire in particular to 
share their emotions, expressions and experiences online [10]. 
One of the attractions of social networking sites is the 
reciprocal nature of such information sharing [11], but social 
networking sites seek to balance the security needs of user 
with their ease of use [12]. While the sharing of information 
provides the foundation under which, many relationships are 
formed [13] it also provides the basis for rekindling 
relationships with old friends [14]. In addition, many social 
networking sites provide incentives for promoting the creation 
of these friendships, sharing general interests or religious 
beliefs, and numerous other activities [11]. In this regard there 
is a vested interest for social networking site providers to 
encourage the sharing of information and there are many 
positive outcomes that can be derived from social networking 
[15].

Social networks have become an alternative to 
communication in many traditional social contexts [15]. 
Increasingly communication takes place online and social 
networking has become a platform that functions in place of 
(or in conjunction with) existing social contexts. However, 
social networking is a relatively new phenomenon and many 
of the social conventions around it are still developing [8] and 
it may be for this reason that many users are complacent about 
the potential risks associated with sharing personal 
information online. For instance, accepting ‘friend’ requests 
may occur far more readily through a social networking site 
than it might off it [16]. Friend requests on a social networking 
site may appear innocuous but later become harmful 
particularly if granted to an identity criminal. Gender 
influences the preparedness of users to share information, with 
men being prepared to share information online more freely 
than women [16]. Furthermore, younger men are seemingly 
more prepared to share information than older men [17] and 
factors like peer pressure may play a role in this. Nonetheless, 
there seems to be complacency in relation to the risks 
associated with information sharing on social networking sites 
with many users sharing information about themselves 
including their full name, their location, date of birth and also 
photographs [13]. This information can be used by identity 
criminals to form an identity that they subsequently use to 
perpetrate crime. 
The interest in social networking is profound, with the 
social networking site Facebook having an estimated 1.15 
billion users. Platforms such as Twitter, Google plus, 
Myspace and LinkedIn have all attracted masses of members 
[18]. While user uptake in social networking sites is 
staggering, user engagement is equally astounding with 20 
per cent of Facebook users checking their accounts numerous 
times per day [18], this is evidence suggesting that many 
users are also using different platforms to log into their 
chosen social networking site whether through a computer, 
mobile phone, tablet or an assortment of these [19]. Indeed, 
new technologies are facilitating an even more committed 
user base for social networking activity. This may contribute 
toward the complacency around the sharing of information. 
In addition to individual users, many businesses interact 
on social networking sites to increase their business exposure 
to customers and clients [20]. They utilize the services of 
social networking providers to share information, advertise, 
promote and position themselves in the wider market and this 
makes them susceptible to identity crime on social 
networking sites in the same way as it does for individuals 
[20]. For corporations, the victimization from identity crime 
may be arising from corporate disclosure rules as this adds to 
the volume of information that is readily available to identity 
criminals [20]. 
In most instances, information acquired by an identity 
criminal is taken without the knowledge or consent of the 
victim [21]. The victim might not be aware that their 
information has been stolen until they find themselves 
exposed to financial liability. The usual motivation for the 
identity criminal is monetary gain but there may be other 
motivations for this crime [22]. The distinction between 
identity theft and fraud is important as identity theft is based 
on the theft of information, and identity fraud results from that 
theft [23]. In Australia, these crime types are distinguished 
through offenses that relate to the possession of identification 
information and offenses related to the dealing with it [24]. 
While both are crimes, offenses that result in financial loss are 
the more detrimental to the victim. Although in absence of 
financial loss it is still possible to suffer detriment from this 
crime.  
Personal identification information is information that 
identifies a person, such as a passport, a driver’s license or a 
bank statement [25]. However, there are other identifiers that 
could be regarded as personal identifying information and 
include demographic details including name, address or date 
of birth [26]. Past research has suggested that sensitive 
information also includes personal photographs, names and 
gender which, are prone to leakage on social networking sites 
[27]. Past research has also shown that Facebook users in 
particular are more prepared to reveal personal information 
(including their real name) on this site as well as including 
email addresses in their profiles [27]. While the documents 
needed to establish identity vary, most governments accept a 
range of identification documents [21] and by world 
standards, name, gender, date of birth and nationality are 
unique personal identifiers that are considered collectively to 
satisfy identity requirements [28]. The information stolen 
may be used by the identity criminal to achieve their desired 
outcomes of establishing identity. Once established they may 
use it for identity fraud or other to commit other crimes [21]. 
In the United States, for instance, identities have been stolen 
and used for perpetrating a range of criminal offences where 
the victims becomes wrongfully accused [21].  
What is interesting in relation to the existing literature is 
that there is a body of literature exploring social networking 
as well as identity crime with little confluence between these 
topics. There is a real risk of identity crime through the 
disclosures of personal identification information on the on 
social networking sites. This paper aims to explore through 
relevant literature how social networking plays an important 
role as an enabler for identity crime. Identity crime is 
pervasive and will exploit emerging social interactions 
online, it is important to understand this vulnerability to 
better mitigate the crime.

METHODOLOGY 
 
This paper is a selective literature review largely from 
countries including Australia, United Kingdom and the 
United States on issues of social networking disclosures and 
identity crime. The literature review is discussed from 
cognate areas with the view to exploring the confluence of 
social networking disclosure and identity crime and 
informing future research into this. As an emerging area of 
research little data presently exists on this topic and the

outlook of this paper is to bring together existing work to 
point toward future opportunities for research work.  
IV. 
HOW THE CRIME IS COMMITTED? 
 
An estimated 16.6 million Americans were the victims of 
identity crime in the United States in 2012 [29]. Around 7% 
of households in the United States experienced identity theft 
victimization in 2010 [30] totaling about 8.6 million 
households [30]. The most quantifiable data relating to loss 
pertains to financial losses and this is expressed in the 
selected literature as follows. In 2010-2011 the estimated cost 
of personal fraud to Australians was $1.4 billion [31] with 
about 44,700 Australians being victims of identity crime [31]. 
Statistics from the United Kingdom suggest that identity 
crime is increasing prodigiously with the reported number of 
cases almost doubling from 77,500 to 123,600 between 2007 
and 2012 [32]. These statistics suggest that identity crime is 
global and significant in terms of its impact and financial 
cost.  
It is likely that the uptake of social networking has 
contributed to the volume of information exchanged and 
subsequently identity crime. Further, among the methods used 
by an identity criminal to obtain information is to utilize social 
engineering to gather information from other users [33]. A 
criminal may purport to be someone else like a friend or 
relative to gather the information they need to commit identity 
crime [34]. Hence caution should be exercised with friend 
requests in addition to the promulgation of information. In the 
context of corporate crime, a criminal might affiliate 
themselves with an organization or someone known to the 
organization [23]. A common rationale for this activity is that 
it is easier to obtain information through manipulation than by 
exploiting system security [35]. This approach seeks to exploit 
social interaction by playing on emotions [36].  
While computer crime occurs through many highly 
technological means and is a highly sophisticated crime, 
paradoxically a basic understanding of computers is all that is 
needed to commit identity crime on the Internet [37]. Unlike 
other computer crime, this crime is pervasive as it is not 
restricted to those with specialist skills. A rudimentary 
understanding of information is what is needed along with an 
understanding of the crime and Internet access. In addition, 
identity crime is easy to commit and there is a low cost to 
committing it [37]. This crime is more readily accessible to 
criminals than many other Internet-related crimes because it is 
an instantaneous crime that is open to many prospective 
criminals [38]. In many respects the Internet has opened up 
numerous online communication mechanisms, as well many 
new ways of committing crime. Many of these aspects of 
identity crime make it attractive to criminals. 
The dissemination of information has increased the risk of 
identity crime as well as establishing a separate industry based 
on the trade of personal identification information. Past 
research has suggested that purchasing information is the most 
common way of obtaining the information needed to 
perpetrate identity crime [39]. Beyond that, there are other 
techniques that can be used to obtain information [40]. 
However, the increased availability of information online has 
created an underground market for that information [41]. This 
presents numerous commercial imperatives for sharing that 
can also feed into identity crime and may devolve from social 
networking. The availability of personal identification 
information is the enabler for this crime and increasingly has 
a measurable monetary value [20]. Further, social networking 
feeds into the mass of information that has such a value and in 
many respects supports the current research around the cloud 
computers and the ways the Internet is emerging [42].  
 
V. 
WHY IS THIS CRIME SERIOUS? 
 
Identity crime has the potential to reach anyone. Research 
conducted at Carnegie Melon University suggests that 
children 15-18 years of age are those most likely to be 
victimized by identity criminals [35]. However, people of 
working age are at also at risk due to their levels of income as 
well as their relevant engagement with emerging technologies 
on the Internet [35]. Working age victims present ready-made 
targets to identity criminals and it is also probable that the risk 
of victimisation is linked to increased levels of engagement 
with technology [39]. Having said that, children have become 
victims of this crime for reasons that include the inadequate 
supervision of children’s Internet usage [43]. Children have a 
vulnerability to identity theft crime as they usually possess 
unblemished personal histories and remain relatively 
undefended as targets of this crime [35]. In addition, children 
often unknowingly share information about themselves that 
can place them at risk particularly if left unmonitored [35]. 
However, anyone using social networking can become a target 
of this crime and social networking: it seems reasonable to 
suggest that the more one reveals about oneself online, the 
more that can be used to perpetrate this crime. 
Identity crime is serious because of the financial and 
emotional cost of the crime. The cost of identity crime 
comprises both direct and indirect costs. The most significant 
cost of identity crime is the financial cost [44], but the cost of 
identity crime extends beyond financial loss and incorporates 
additional costs referred to as soft costs [44]. The financial 
costs (the hard costs) are easily quantified whereas the non-
financial costs (soft costs), such as those that relate to the cost 
of damage to reputation and the emotional cost of the crime, 
are more difficult to quantify and to prevent [44]. However, 
the cumulative losses can only be determined by considering 
both the hard and soft costs of this crime [44]. The banking 
sector for instance, is exposed to significant losses in relation 
to identity crime [44] but its spokespersons remain reluctant 
to disclose the losses arising from this crime [45]. 
Nonetheless, bank losses in the United States have been 
estimated to amount to over $2 billion per year [46]. However, 
due to the commercial sensitivities many banks are reluctant 
to share data [45]. This reluctance contributes towards the 
difficulty of establishing an accurate measurement of the true 
cost of identity crime [47]. Furthermore, there are issues with 
victims not reporting victimisation that also contributes 
toward the lack of accurate data [48]. The crime has a

profound impact on an individual in terms of damaging their 
reputation and confidence as well as being financially 
reprehensible. 
 
VI. 
RESPONDING TO THE CRIME 
 
There are many practical difficulties in convicting identity 
criminals [47]. In the first place, in an international context, 
no central body is responsible for overseeing crime committed 
via the Internet. For this reason, controlling crime perpetrated 
through social networking sites is fraught with difficulties in 
the investigation and enforcement [48]. The Internet is a 
dispersed communication entity that permeates country 
boundaries, making regulatory responses difficult [48]. 
Further, different values influence the ways in which, crimes 
are viewed domestically and most international instruments 
continue to require attention through domestic laws. Success 
of responsive efforts will be dependent on the stance 
maintained by each country in question [49]. 
The European Cybercrime Convention has worked to 
harmonize the regulation of cyber-crimes internationally [50] 
and it provides domestic criminal law authorities with 
cooperative mechanisms to investigate and prosecute 
computer crimes [50]. The term ‘cybercrime’ is a phrase the 
European Convention uses to describe crimes where the 
computer or computer network is the target. Computer crime 
is distinguishable from traditional crimes because a computer 
is used to commit the crime [51]. This therefore subsumes 
frauds where the computer is used as a tool to commit the 
crime [50]. Likewise, when identity crime takes place through 
the computer it is arguably captured within the scope of the 
European Convention. However, the European Convention 
fails to deal directly with identity crime [50]. Rather, it 
captures computer-related forgery (article 7) as well as 
computer-related fraud (article 8) and it would apply to related 
offenses including identity crime but this is not made explicit 
[50]. The significance of this convention is that it assists in the 
investigation and enforcement of identity crime despite not 
making reference to it [50]. Given its scope for computer 
crimes, it would arguably encompass identity crime. 
Unfortunately, there is nothing simple about applying 
criminal sanctions to international identity crime particularly 
when they fall outside globally acknowledged crimes and 
atrocities such as genocide. Even so, the effectiveness of such 
responses is reliant on the preparedness of countries to agree 
and cooperate on responses to crime.  
 
VII. PRIVACY PERSPECTIVE 
 
International responses to privacy share comparable 
challenges with the international regulation of crimes on the 
Internet. There is a lack of centrality when it comes to the 
regulation of privacy internationally [52]. Domestic laws are 
often based on international agreements that are relied upon to 
regulate privacy [48]. International principles of privacy 
protection are provided for in international agreements like the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights [53]. This 
international agreement recognizes the protection of the 
inalienable rights of all humans to privacy, highlighting the 
need for them to enjoy freedom of speech and belief [53]. 
Further, Article 12 suggests that no one should be subjected to 
interference with respect to their privacy [53]. This 
international agreement provides the foundation for the 
development of domestic laws in the same way as the 
European Convention does for cybercrimes [48]. However, 
despite the operation of this agreement, a limitation of the 
Australian privacy responses, for instance, is that they are not 
prescriptive. Further, privacy is constrained by the same 
jurisdictional boundaries that limit the extraterritorial reach of 
criminal sanctions explained above [54]. This means that there 
are challenges of dealing with identity crime and privacy in an 
international context. 
 
VIII. FOCUS ON THE VICTIMS 
 
The perpetrators of identity crime are illusive and many 
victims will often not know that they have become victims 
until considerable time has passed [55]. The time between 
when an identity crime occurs and an investigation takes place 
makes it difficult to gather evidence about the crime and to 
locate and prosecute the offender [55]. During this time, the 
victim must withstand the frustration and emotional distress 
and the financial losses caused by the crime. The impact of 
this is worsened the longer it takes for the situation to be 
resolved [56]. The subversive nature of this crime adds to a 
victim’s frustration as well as facilitating the criminal’s 
opportunity to evade capture. The crime also places an 
emotional burden on the victim and once an identity crime is 
discovered it can also take considerable time to resolve [56]. 
This delay influences the ability of law enforcement to 
investigate the crime effectively and provides the criminal 
with a greater likelihood of avoiding capture. This crime is 
pervasive and the criminal’s illusive natures makes it difficult 
to capture them. Identity criminals may also harvest personal 
information over a period of time [39]. Further, the victim of 
the crime will find it difficult to determine when and where 
the information was obtained and what corrective action they 
should take to avoid future victimisation. 
 
IX. 
DIFFICULTIES OF RESPONDING TO THE CRIME 
 
A major challenge in responding to identity crime is the 
ability of law enforcement agencies to obtain evidence for the 
prosecution of perpetrators of this crime. The gathering of 
evidence involves obtaining digital evidence both on- and off-
line [57]. As there are many new ways of using information, 
it is essential for investigative efforts to deal with the speed 
data transference takes place on the Internet, making the 
investigation of identity crimes difficult [58]. Furthermore, as 
160
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 6 no 3 & 4, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

identity crime is cross jurisdictional, cooperation between law 
enforcement authorities is essential [59]. This also makes the 
civil responses to identity crime difficult given the scarcity of 
resources the individual has to prosecute criminals. Similar 
issues around detecting and locating the offender also exist for 
these actions. 
A key weakness in the integrity of data is the way 
individual users manage their own information. Social 
networking users need to be more accountable for the 
information they willfully share on social networking sites. 
Each activity we engage in on the Internet leaves traces and a 
commonsense response to dealing with the exploitation of 
social networking by identity criminals is for social 
networking users to improve their behavioral practises on the 
Internet [57]. An educational program is necessary to ensure 
that social networking users are aware of the risks and of the 
need to exercise caution with respect to the sharing of personal 
information [60]. Moreover, this should take into account the 
ways information might potentially be misused by criminals 
[59]. While education could have a direct impact on crime 
reduction there will typically be a proportion of the population 
not responsive to such efforts [59]. The role of education is 
not going to resolve the crime entirely but irrespective it 
should be regarded as a way of dealing with this crime. 
However, social networking sites also should accept some 
responsibility for the protection of the users as they are 
responsible for attracting and retaining them. This should be 
broader than the general technological security measures and 
needs to include the architecture underpinning the sites to give 
users better understanding [61]. This might involve 
reconsidering the architecture that facilitates information 
exchange. Ultimately, identity crime can be reduced through 
better understanding of and mitigation of these risks [62].   
Social networking providers put forward mechanisms to 
assist in the protection of information [15]. However, many of 
the tools used by social networking sites are underutilized, 
which, may be due to their complexity or lack of integration 
with the interface [15]. Alternatively, it may be due to the lack 
of engagement with the technology. Many users tend to utilize 
default functions within their profile that could mitigate many 
of the benefits of these tools [63]. More could be done by 
social networking providers to apply enhanced measures 
through related tools to protect users. 
A number of additional and general technical responses can 
be applied to prevent identity crimes. The responses include 
improved authentication and encryption measures and might 
also involve elementary information security measures [62]. 
The purpose of technological responses is to ensure data 
integrity is maintained while correspondingly preventing 
unwanted misuse of information or intrusion [64]. However, 
as with most responses, these efforts aim to improve 
information integrity [62], but the strength of the responses to 
identity crime are often balanced against the perceived costs 
of such preventative action. In this respect, the threat of 
identity crime and the need for technological protection is 
understated. Nonetheless, these important technological 
measures provide additional ways to deal with information 
security and identity crime. 
 
X. 
THE PROFILE OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKING USER AT 
RISK 
 
Research conducted by Fogel and Nehmad indicated that 
certain social networking users are more prepared to engage 
in risk taking behaviors than others. Further, Facebook users 
have a greater sense of trust in the service they use than 
Myspace users [9]. In this regard, it has been found that men 
are more prepared to accept requests for friendship on social 
networking sites than are women. Men are also more prepared 
to share details like phone numbers and addresses than women 
[9]. This is where there appears to be a dichotomy between 
those that share information on the Internet and victims. But 
interestingly and somewhat conversely, it is women that are 
more often victimized in identity crime than men [9]. 
However, anyone using social networking sites is at risk and 
it seems that the more information that is shared equates to 
greater risk. 
As mentioned, the development of protocols for 
communication on social networking sites is still developing 
and this influences the ways that information is shared. An 
interesting example of this is how people accept friends on 
social networking sites. The likely behaviors online are 
expected to be quite different to those undertaken in person 
outside the Internet [17]. Permitting a friend to have access to 
a profile is viewed far differently than the parameters of 
friendship that exist beyond the Internet. However, in many 
respects there are some elements of these relationships that are 
likely to be similar and shared. Walther and Boyd refer to 
friendship as a relationship of support based around emotional 
support [2]. However, the characteristics of friendship on this 
basis offline are difficult to transpose to a social networking 
‘friend’ online [65]. What is interesting about this interaction 
is that the characteristic behaviors offline are not transposed 
online, this is interesting to observe as the protocols continue 
to develop, and this changes the profile of the victim. 
The issue of consent on social networking raises questions 
about the right to share information belonging to another. 
Given the lack of prevalence of privacy principles on social 
networking sites, it is difficult to assume that consent is freely 
given for the use of personal information on social networking 
sites [66]. The issue of consent extends to the timeframes that 
information is retained on social networking sites. On these 
sites, data are typically subject to retention periods but these 
are often not adhered to, as interesting information is used in 
profile histories to attract new users [67]. Much of the 
information on social networking sites is also used to derive 
commercial benefits, this may be contrary and likely to be 
different from users’ expectations about how this information 
will be used [15]. It is important to note that the business 
model of social networking providers is based on the 
dissemination of information and these providers arguably 
161
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 6 no 3 & 4, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

challenge the legal boundaries of privacy through the way 
they exchange data [15]. Once information has been passed 
on, particularly to third parties, it is unclear as to what 
obligations will be adhered to and the responsibilities of these 
parties are not defined [15]. Despite this being beyond the 
scope of this paper, users need to understand the risks attached 
to third party applications and understand the specific consent 
they are providing to the use of their sensitive information [8]. 
There are also significant privacy-related issues with these 
providers and the providers of third party applications to 
social networking sites, but this falls beyond the scope of this 
discussion. 
There is an obvious dichotomy between the stakeholders 
involved with the protection of personal identification 
information and end users. Despite the many attempts to warn 
of the risks of information disclosure, information is still 
shared. The motivations of social networking providers are at 
odds with that of users [15]. There is a need to find the middle 
ground to ensure that a shared understanding is formed around 
the sensitivity of information online [68]. An educative effort 
is needed to deal with crimes [69], like identity crime that 
should include the social networking providers but should not 
be administered by them, given their divergent interests. There 
are few motivations for social networking sites to change their 
approach as there would be commercial ramifications in doing 
so [69]. However, they are in the best position to understand 
the architecture behind the interface and to deal with the 
problem.  
Some researchers suggest that the improvement to privacy 
must come from improvements in the technology that 
underpins the architecture used by social networking services 
[62]. It is the technology that encourages information sharing 
in the first place, so the same technology can mitigate the 
incidence of crime in the future. The commercial interests may 
need to put aside interest for the greater good to reduce 
identity crime [27]. While many ways of exploiting 
individuals still exist, social networking has brought about 
new ways to exploit individuals and the service itself can play 
a role in reducing it [65]. The accessibility of social 
networking is an enabler for identity crime and the low cost of 
identity crime plays a role perpetuating the crime [66]. This 
crime brings new ways of committing old offenses [66]. In 
short, it would seem right that the mechanism itself should 
play a role in the solution. 
 
XI. 
DISCUSSION 
 
Ultimately, policymakers should consider a multi-faceted 
approach for dealing with identity crime [70]. A mixture of 
techniques is necessary to counteract the threats of identity 
crime as it requires a ubiquitous response [71]. The 
relationship between social networking and identity crime is 
unique and therefore requires unique and creative responses. 
A major obstacle to responding to social networking and 
identity crime is the availability of accurate data relating to the 
relationship between the two concepts. While not all 
approaches to dealing with this phenomenon have been 
canvassed in this paper, the ones that have provide insight into 
the many issues evident. In particular, there is a need for a 
greater understanding of the behavioral factors of individuals 
in interacting with technology [72]. In addition, steps need to 
be taken to deal with the dissemination of information to avoid 
victimisation as well as better mechanisms to deal with this 
crime after it occurs [73].  
The motivation for this research has been to explore the 
relationship between identity crime and social networking 
which, has scarcely been explored in existing literature and to 
establish a basis for further research to take place. More 
empirical research is needed to probe the parameters of this 
relationship.  It is hoped that more interest in this research will 
be generated by raising awareness of this relationship.   
XII. EVALUATION 
 
The material discussed in this paper has largely been 
drawn from secondary sources to identify a relationship 
between social networking and identity crime. To develop the 
contention further, empirical research is needed to discover 
the scope of this relationship. This paper has explored a 
number of responses to this phenomenon but these are by no 
means exhaustive and further research into the relationship 
between social networking and identity crime would be likely 
to provide greater insights into the mechanisms that might 
better deal with this crime.  
 
XIII. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Information is a vehicle for identity crime and 
considerable information is stored on social networking sites. 
Legal and technological responses have limitations in relation 
to the extent they can mitigate this crime particularly given the 
voluntary nature of information dissemination and the issues 
around jurisdiction and cooperation discussed [74]. The 
individual 
vulnerability 
arises 
because 
of 
personal 
identification information that eventually means that 
behavioral factors are important in mitigating risk. Therefore, 
it is hoped that through the dissemination of research and 
information that individuals may become better informed of 
the risks inherent in the activities they engage in on the 
Internet involving information sharing, particularly social 
networking. Individual users of social networking need to take 
greater 
responsibility 
for 
the personal identification 
information shared on social networking sites to avoid 
victimisation. In this respect, if behavioral norms can be 
changed on social networking sites then the risk inherent with 
identity crime can be reduced.  
At the same time, individuals remain ambivalent to the 
risks that come from information sharing. A difficulty with 
information on social networking sites is that once it is shared 
with another person, it becomes harder to control [68].

Likewise the privacy mechanisms to prevent this are not 
strong. Social networking makes the protection of information 
far more difficult than traditional means, as information can 
be transferred instantaneously. With social networking, a 
tension exists between the technical designers of social 
networking sites and users concerning the disclosure of 
information, as one requires it for survival and the other for 
the joy of sharing experiences [75]. For social network 
providers this involves striking a balance, as far as they are 
compelled to, between the interests of members sharing 
information and their self-interest in promoting information 
sharing and risk [12].  
More regulatory development is needed around privacy in 
an international context to develop principles to reflect the 
changing ways that information sharing takes place on the 
Internet. The regulatory environment needs to be progressive 
in the way that it deals with the changing risks present on the 
Internet [71]. In this, there are behavioral factors that need to 
be the focus as these relate to the decisions made by users in 
sharing information. Similarly, a better understanding of the 
crime and the new ways it can be committed through using 
social networking need to be developed [76].  
 
XIV. IDENTITY CRIME REGULATION GLOBALLY 
 
A number of barriers exist to dealing with this and related 
internet crime from a regulatory standpoint [77]. Criminal law 
has limitations in particular in supporting the victims of the 
crime. There are multiple issues that need to be resolved for 
regulation to be effective such as the need for cooperation to 
deal with the jurisdictional barriers to facilitate the 
investigation and prosecution of identity crimes [78]. The 
barriers to criminal sanctions also have an impact on actions 
in privacy as well as civil causes of action for the victims of 
this crime. In the absence of clear legal pathways, victims are 
left with few options for obtaining reparation. The issues of 
state sovereignty also present obstacles for actions against 
criminals [71]. The varied responses to identity crime 
complicate this. These present limitations on the ability of 
states and individuals to bring the offenders to justice and for 
victims to obtain support [80]. Internationally, there is a need 
for mechanisms to be developed in this realm to deal with the 
unique characteristics of this crime [71]. This will then 
translate to better domestic responses to this crime and related 
crime in Australia, as well as elsewhere [81]. 
 
XV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
Social networking has encouraged many users to share 
personal information online, and social network users 
frequently engage in the sharing of information about 
themselves [12]. The sharing of personal identification 
information is prominent on social networking sites in ways 
that promote profiles which, might include details such 
demographic details and others. This article has considered 
the many ways that social networking can potentially nourish 
the transference of personal information on the Internet, in 
turn providing identity criminals with the information needed 
to commit identity crime. While there are many ways to 
respond to this crime, a blend of techniques is likely to work 
best, given the pervasive nature of this crime and barriers 
presented by multiple jurisdictions. These issues pertain not 
only to the difficulty of applying criminal sanctions but also 
to those relating to privacy in a transnational context. Future 
research is needed to explore responses to this crime in detail. 
An important starting point for dealing with this crime is to 
increase awareness of the risks associated with information 
sharing around social networking. More research is also 
needed to develop further knowledge about this crime and to 
understand the data surrounding identity crime and the nexus 
of this to the responses to it. This research would aim to 
recognize identity crime as the pervasive and significant crime 
it is now and will continue to be into the future.
