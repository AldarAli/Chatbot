Abstract— Reduction of silver oxide in plasma is studied. Silver
oxide film was prepared by plasma oxidation of thermally
evaporated silver film. It is shown that silver oxide is reduced
with different rate in He, Ar and N2 plasmas excited by rf power.
To clarify mechanism of reduction, morphology, electrical and
optical properties of the samples are analyzed. Spectroscopic
ellipsometry is used to measure thicknesses and optical
constants of oxidized and reduced layers. It is concluded that the
reduction is activated by low energy electron bombardment of
silver oxide.
Keywords-silver oxide; plasma reduction; silver thin film.

INTRODUCTION
Both silver and silver oxide are widely used as functional
material in microdevices. Silver is the best plasmonic material
in visible range and has found broad application in sensors,
photonics, catalysis and spectroscopy [1]. Unique properties
of silver oxide are used in optical storage devices, gas sensors,
photovoltaic cells and photonics [2]. Silver and silver oxide
are applied both in the form of thin films, and in the form of
nanostructures. Additionally, non-stoichiometric silver oxide
AgxO or silver oxide with silver inclusions can be used instead
of pure oxide. Properties of silver oxide nanostructures and
thin films are found to be sensitive to fabrication method. It
has caused a big variety of the applied methods, such as
thermal evaporation [3], reactive magnetron sputtering [4],
chemical-bath deposition [5], exposing silver ¿lms to atomic
oxygen environment [6][7], and so on. The last method is very
attractive, because it opens an opportunity for application of
well known Ag deposition methods in preparation of silver
oxide films. Furthermore, interconversion of Ag into AgxO
and AgxO in Ag would be desirable for fabrication of silver
containing nanostructures and AgxO films with controlled
silver content. Suitable reduction process of Ag2O  to  Ag
would be also benefit for removing of native oxide layer from
silver structures (SERS substrates etc.) after long storage.
However, reports about reciprocal conversion of AgxO into
Ag in dry ambient (gas, plasma) are concentrated on
application of reducing agents like H2 or annealing in inert
ambient [8][9]. In the first case, the reducing agent can involve
undesirable reactions with other materials of microdevice. In
the second case, high temperature can limit choice of materials
used in fabrication process. Nevertheless, publications about
conversion of AgxO into Ag without reducing agents are
occasional and devoted to interaction of AgxO surface with
energetic particles.
In this paper, we propose to use inert gas plasma for dry
reduction of silver oxide films. It is demonstrated that
conversion of AgxO in Ag is possible in a standard reactor for
dry etching using Ar, He or N2 plasma. The reduction rate is
proportional to ionization degree of plasma, i.e., concentration
of electrons near processed sample. Ag content in the obtained
films depends on plasma gas and can be controlled in broad
range by process parameters, including reduction time,
pressure and rf power.
The paper is organized in a following way. In the
subsequent Section II, details of sample preparation and
measurement procedures are presented. In Section III, results
of the work are demonstrated by scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images, electrical measurements as well as
ȥ, ǻ spectra and reflection spectra of the fabricated samples.
In Section IV, possible reduction mechanism of Ag2O in inert
gas plasma is discussed. In Section V, the conclusion is drawn.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
A crystalline Si wafer (100 mm in diameter, 0.5-mm-thick,
<100>) was used as a substrate. To increase accuracy of
optical measurements, a 609 nm thick SiO2 layer was prepared
by thermal oxidation of the Si wafer. A 15 nm thick silver
layer was deposited by electron-beam evaporation with the
deposition rate of 0.3 nm/s and base pressure 2×10-7 Torr. All
plasma treatments were made in two identical parallel plate
reactors, which differ by sample position in a reactor. In the
plasma etching (PE) reactor the sample was fixed on grounded
electrode, in the reactive ion etching (RIE) reactor the sample
was fixed on isolated electrode. Metal deposition and plasma
treatments were done at room temperature.
Plasma oxidation was done in PE reactor during 90
seconds at oxygen flow of 100 sccm, pressure 1000 mTorr and
rf power 20W. Several identical AgxO samples were prepared
to compare reduction in different conditions. For this purpose
the  whole  wafer  was  cut  on  chips  (2×2  cm2), which were
further processed separately, but at the same pressure 500
mTor and during the same time 60 s. The sample #1 was
treated in RIE reactor at Ar flow 50 sccm, the samples #2, #3
were processed in PE reactor at flow 500 sccm of He and N2,
respectively. Diluted ammonia solution (NH3 25  %  from
Honeywell) NH3:H2O = 1:1 was used for selective etching of
Ag2O. This treatment does not affect on Ag, Si and SiO2. All
samples were etched during 20 s.

Silver film was deposited in e-beam evaporation system
IM-9912 (Instrumentti Mattila Oy, Finland). Plasma
treatments were done in 13.56 MHz driven parallel electrode
reactors Plasmalab 80 Plus (Oxford Instruments Plasma
Technology). To investigate the prepared samples, plane-view
image observations were performed in Zeiss Supra 40 field
emission scanning electron microscope. Spectroscopic
ellipsometry (SE) measurements in the range of 700–1700 nm
at the angle 70º were done by spectroscopic ellipsometer SE
805 (SENTECH Instruments GmbH). Sheet resistance of
films was measured by four points probe method. Reflectance
measurements were carried out using a FilmTek 4000
(Scientific Computing International, USA) reflectometer at
normal light incidence in the spectral range 400–1700 nm.

RESULTS
In this section, the results of sequential oxidation of as
deposited silver film and reduction of obtained silver oxide
film are reported. To justify silver oxidation and AgxO
reduction, comparison of electrical, optical and chemical
properties is performed.
A. Oxidation
In the beginning, reflection measurements for as deposited
and plasma-oxidized silver films were made. Due to thick
SiO2 layer (609 nm), reflection from the Si substrate and low
absorption in the upper layer, interference effects have been
observed in both films (Fig. 1). It was noted that interference
maxima of the silver film at 570 nm and 830 nm correspond
to  interference  minima  of  the  AgxO film at the same
wavelengths. Taking into account negligible optical thickness
of the upper layer (less than ɉ/8) and identical thicknesses of
SiO2 layers, this fact can be only explained by different phase
shift upon reflection from Ag and AgxO layers. Difference in
phase shift is close to 180°. It means that the original metal
layer has been converted into dielectric one after oxidation
[10]. The formation of silver oxide is also evident from wet
etching in ammonia solution. Silver film remains invariable,
but  AxO film is totally removed. The SEM images also
confirm difference between as deposited and oxidized silver

films (Fig. 2). The discontinuous Ag film, including voids of
random shape converts in agglomeration of closely packed
crystallites. Cubic shape of crystallites resembles cubic
crystalline structure of Ag2O.
To measure optical constants of oxidized silver, SE was
used. It is based on measurement of ellipsometric angles ȥ, ǻ
in the range of wavelengths. After that the sample is described
by simplified model from several optical layers and ȥ, ǻ are
calculated for the model. Then, matching between measured
and calculated ȥ, ǻ is done for different parameters of optical
layers. The obtained ȥ, ǻ spectra of as deposited and oxidized
silver films are given in Fig. 3. Totally different ȥ, ǻ curves
before and after oxidation confirm conversion of Ag into
AgxO.
To extract optical constants of the oxidized silver, the
ellipsometric spectra were analyzed by model with layered
structure. The model contains the pure Ag2O layer (thickness
h1) and the Ag2O:Ag layer (thickness h2), as shown in Fig.4a.
The A2O:Ag composite was described in the assumption that
it consists of Ag2O matrix and Ag inclusions. The dielectric
function of composite was calculated according to the
Bruggemann eơective-medium approximation (EMA). The
unknown dielectric function of the Ag2O was found by using
Tauc-Lorentz dispersion formula with two oscillators.
Parameters of these Lorentz oscillators are linked to imaginary
part of the dielectric function and are listed in Table I. Ai is
related to strength of the i-th absorption peak (i=1,2), Ci is the
damping coefficient of the i-th oscillator, Ei is the energy
position of the i-th peak. Two additional parameters are
optical band gap energy Eg = 0.21 eV and high frequency
dielectric constant ɂλ = 1.06.

normal dispersion, i.e., decrease for longer wavelength in
contrast to silver optical constants, which increase with
wavelength. The purpose of optical calculations is
justification of oxidation or reduction reactions in plasma
ambient. In this context, absolute values of optical constants
are not so significant as their variations in response on process
parameter changing.

spectra of original (Ag) and reduced (Ag-R) silver (sample #2)
are compared. The coinciding maxima and minima of Ag and
Ag-R prove conversion of semiconductor AgxO into metal
Ag. Etching in ammonia solution does not affect on samples
processed in Ar and He plasma (#1 and #2, respectively), but
removes central part of sample #3, processed in N2 plasma.
Only 4 mm wide strip of changed colour was left around
sample perimeter after ammonia processing. Fig. 6 shows
SEM images of the sample #3 before and after wet etching in
the edge area. The observed changing is possible, if the film
consists of Ag2O and Ag. After wet etching Ag2O is removed,
leaving Ag phase on the substrate. SEM images of the central
areas  of  the  AgxO film processed in Ar (sample #1), He
(sample #2) and N2 (sample #3) plasma are shown in Fig. 7.
While Ar and He processed samples demonstrate similar
images of silver films with different fragmentation, the image
of the sample #3 is more complicate. It can be considered as
dark background from AgxO at which bright silver inclusions
are visible.
The ȥ, ǻ spectra of reduced AgxO for the sample #1 are
shown  in  Fig.  3.  They  look  very  similar  to  spectra  of  as
deposited silver. Reconstruction of sample layers after
reduction was done by using optical models shown in Fig. 4b
and Fig. 4c. The composite Ag2O:Ag layer was described by
EMA and the model for Ag2O obtained at oxidation step
(Table 1) was used. After that, only thickness and Ag content
in layers were changed during matching. In such a way,
efficiency of reduction can be estimated by total Ag content
in films.
The results of optical measurements are given in Table II.
The samples processed in Ar and He can be considered
consisting of Ag2O:Ag layer (thickness h2) and rough silver
layer (thickness h3), modeled as Ag:air composite. The sample
processed in N2, additionally includes pure Ag2O layer
(thickness h1)  at  SiO2 interface. The total Ag fraction in
samples was calculated as average of layer Ag contents
according to thickness weight function (fraction of layer
thickness in total thickness). Total thickness of all reduced
samples is practically the same (Table II) and much less than
thickness of AgxO film. The thicknesses of as deposited and
reduced silver cannot be compared, because they were
estimated by quartz microbalance and SE, respectively.
Effect of process parameters on reduction result was
studied by monitoring resistivity and Ag content. Fig. 8
demonstrates dependence of these characteristics on process

time for PE reactor with He plasma. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show
variation of resistivity and Ag content with process pressure
and rf power, respectively, in RIE reactor with Ar plasma. The
fullest reduction happens when processes is done during 60 s
at pressure 125 mTor. Mirror like behavior of curves for
resistivity and Ag content reflect the fact that Ag inclusions
are responsible for electrical conductivity of the samples.
IV.
DISCUSSION
The obtained film parameters and SEM images
demonstrate synthesis and decomposition of silver oxide
during forward reaction of oxidation and reverse reaction of
reduction, respectively. Indeed, total transformation of optical
and electrical properties of the film after O2 plasma processing
and full restoration of these properties after inert gas plasma
treatment (Table II), can be reasonably explained by
formation of silver oxide AgxO and its conversion into silver,
respectively. In this section, we discuss the possible reduction
mechanism of silver oxide.
Any sample treated in plasma is bombarded by electrons
and ions. The maximum energy of bombarding ions depends
on the sample potential. In the PE reactor, the processed
sample has potential around 10V relatively plasma. In the RIE
reactor, the sample potential is equal to dc self-bias (16 V for
sample #1) and depends on process parameters. The beginning
of sputtering is defined by threshold energy, which is equal 25
eV and 34 eV for silver sputtering by Ar and He ions,

respectively [11][12]. Therefore, ion energy for He reduction
process in the PE reactor is less than threshold sputtering level
and sputtering effect cannot be responsible for AgxO
reduction.
Energy required to break chemical bonds can be delivered
in different ways. For example, silver oxide is decomposed on
silver and atomic oxygen during low temperature treatment
(200 °C) or under UV irradiation. It means that Ag2O has low
bond energy and Ag-O bond can be easily broken. Electron
bombardment is often used for breaking chemical bonds. Low
energy primary electrons (160 eV) are able to generate
secondary electrons, displace oxygen anions and reduce
oxides, e.g., TiO2 [13]. In case of Ag2O, secondary electron
emission is strong enough and starts when primary electron
energy exceeds 5 eV. Therefore, reduction of Ag2O by low
energy electrons is also possible and mechanism of plasma
reduction is decomposition of Ag2O on Ag and atomic oxygen
under bombardment of electrons ejected from plasma. It
means, that reduction rate depends on electron concentration
in plasma or degree of its ionization.
At low rf power and low electron energy, most particle
collisions in plasma lead to molecule dissociation and
excitation, but not to ionization [14]. In monoatomic gases
(Ar, He), dissociation is not possible and ionization is more
effective than in diatomic gases (N2). In other words, plasma
concentration is higher for Ar and He, than for N2. In case of
sample #3 (N2 plasma), it explains the lowest reduction rate,
demonstrated by the highest resistivity, the lowest Ag fraction
and totally different morphology of reduced film in
comparison with He and Ar processed samples. Deviation in
plasma concentration leads also to different reduction
efficiency in Ar and He plasmas. Ionization energy for He and
Ar atoms is 25 eV and 16 eV, respectively. Lower ionization
energy leads to higher electron concentration in Ar plasma.
Increasing of Ag content with rf power (Fig. 10) is in
accordance with dependence of reduction rate on plasma
concentration, which is proportional to electrical field
strength. However, at rf power higher than 16W, trends in
behavior of ɏ and Ag content (Fig. 10) are changed. At high
power, bias exceeds 25 V, ion energy is above threshold
sputtering energy of Ag and sputtering effect becomes
significant. It results in preferable silver sputtering from
Ag2O:Ag composite.

Plasma reduction of silver oxide requires only electron
impact and can take place in any plasma, e.g., in oxygen one.
Silver film oxidized by oxygen plasma is simultaneously
exposed to electron irradiation. Electrons facilitate Ag2O
reduction at the same time, when atomic oxygen oxidizes
silver. As a result full Ag oxidation does not happen and silver
inclusions are observed in Ag2O obtained in both PE and RIE
reactors (Table II).
V.
CONCLUSION
Standard parallel plate reactor can be used both for plasma
oxidation of silver, and for plasma reduction of silver oxide.
In contrast to oxidation, which happens in atomic oxygen
ambient, reduction does not require chemically active species
and is done in inert gas plasma. Possible reduction mechanism
is connected with breaking of Ag-O bonds and generation of
secondary electrons. Bond breaking happens due to
interaction of silver oxide with electrons and ions of plasma.
Rate of plasma reduction is proportional to plasma
concentration and can be tuned by plasma gas, rf power and
working pressure. Morphology of silver films obtained by
processing of AgxO in plasma depends on reduction rate and
differs for He, Ar and N2 plasmas.
Sequential silver oxidation and reduction in one reactor
may be useful in obtaining of AgxO films with controlled
silver content.
