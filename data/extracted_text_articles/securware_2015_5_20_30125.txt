Abstract—The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard 
(PCI-DSS) is a standard that aims to harmonize and 
strengthen the protection of Card Data in the whole lifecycle. 
Since its introduction, it has always been an efficient tool for 
controlling Card data on a platform deployed internally. In 
addition, it has been proved that this standard is among the 
best one for gauging data security, because it dictates a series 
of scrupulous controls and how they could be implemented. 
However, with the coming of the Cloud, the strategies have 
changed and the issues in protecting Card data become more 
complex. In this paper, we continue our previous work by 
developing a checklist that will be a reference for the Cloud 
tenant to control the security of Card data and information on 
the Cloud Computing. In the next steps, we will focus on 
evaluating this checklist on a real Cloud environment. 
Afterward, we work on recommending more requirements and 
controls that the norm PCI-DSS could adopt to be more 
efficient on Cloud and later we will develop a new Self-
Assessment Questionnaire as a reference for Qualified Security 
Assessors (QSA) to check on the environment.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
As the competition puts pressure on companies to 
increase productivity and decrease capital investments, 
solutions like distributed computing, that offer scalable 
systems with low fees, are attractive options for management 
to take in consideration. However, when you are responsible 
for the security of the access and the network, the idea of 
migrating everything to an environment that is not controlled 
and even owned, probably makes the decision more difficult. 
Therefore, many banks and card transactions companies, 
which are attracted to outsourcing card solution outside their 
premises, encounter several obstacles, mainly related to 
security and data governance. The client has the 
responsibility to know where its data are and where it is 
going. This concept is the basis to data security, and plays a 
significant role in achieving and maintaining compliance 
with security norms, mainly the PCI-DSS [2].  
Unfortunately, most of the requirements focus on the 
merchant’s ability to implement network access controls, 
data control, and insuring that the applications installed 
respect the security norms by periodically test their 
effectiveness. In addition, it may be difficult to do it and 
insufficient in a Cloud platform, where the infrastructure is 
outsourced [7].  
In this paper, we continue our previous work [1] by 
developing a checklist that will be an efficient tool for banks 
and Card companies to control if the Cloud platform is ready 
to receive Card solutions or not. We based our contribution 
on two mains frameworks: Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) 
[6] developed by Cloud Computing Alliance (CSA) and PCI-
DSS. 
In the next section, there is an explanation of the main 
advantages of the CCM [4] and its domains. Section III 
explains the choices of domains on what we focus on. 
Section IV details the matrix developed and the 
correspondent checklist for client that allow them to verify 
the effectiveness of the platform outsourced (we give an 
extract of the checklist in Table I). Section V brings a critical 
view to PCI-DSS standard insufficiency in Cloud computing. 
Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section VI. 
II. 
THE CCM AND THE PCI-DSS 
In [1], we have explained the main purpose of the norm 
PCI-DSS, its strength and its weaknesses linked to the cloud 
domain; the referential is rich but it is not adapted to the 
cloud environment. 
The Cloud Security Alliance’s CCM is a rich source of 
cloud security best practices designed as a framework to 
provide fundamental security principles to cloud vendors and 
cloud customers. It provides a controls framework that gives 
detailed understanding of security concepts and principles 
that are aligned to the Cloud Security Alliance guidance in 
16 domains (latest version 3.0.1) [4]. This tool provides the 
holistic adherence to the vast and ever evolving landscape of 
global data privacy regulations and security standards. 
The CCM serves as the basis for new industry standards 
and certifications. It is the first ever baseline control 
framework specifically designed for managing risk in the 
Cloud Supply Chain: 
 
Addressing the inter- and intra-organizational 
challenges of persistent information security by 
clearly delineating control ownership. 
 
Providing an anchor point and common language for 
balanced measurement of security and compliance 
postures.

The PCI-DSS is a broadly accepted set of policies and 
procedures intended to optimize the security of credit, debit 
and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against 
misuse of their personal information. Therefore, it is not 
possible for a client to leverage the benefits of cloud systems 
without jeopardizing security, and mainly Card Data.  
In this paper, we focus on creating for each topic on 
CCM list a matching PCI-DSS requirement in order to get a 
series of checklists on what the client could depend on to 
verify the trustworthiness of the Cloud before deciding to 
outsource. 
III. 
THE DOMAINS OF APPLICATION 
In our work, we focused on 4 main areas (domains) 
because they represent a basis for any tenant to check and 
control Cloud before deciding to outsource or not. Figure 1 
shows the four domains, which are Network and Transport 
security, Data Security, Application and interface security, 
and Business Continuity management: 
Figure 1.  The domains developed in the checklist 
 
Network and Transport security: These controls 
allow verifying the security of the Card Data on 
network while it’s transmitted. It is essential for the 
tenant to check this aspect scrupulously before 
deploying on the Cloud. 
 
Data Security: These controls allow verifying the 
security of the Card data and preventing it from any 
leakage.  
 
Application and interface security: These controls 
aim to ensure that any Application and Programming 
Interface (APIs) is designed, developed, deployed 
and tested respecting the PCI-DSS norms in order to 
avoid any leakage. 
 
Business Continuity management: These controls 
aim at insuring the business continuity of the 
activities in any issue or disaster. The client should 
be sure that the activity could continue without any 
deterioration. 
In the next section, we describe the checklist developed 
with an exhaustive questionnaire as a tool for any Cloud 
specialist to verify the compliance of a cloud and its 
readiness to outsource or not. 
IV. 
THE CHECKLIST MATRIX 
Our work, as described above, is developing a checklist 
based on 4 domains and 33 controls. Each control addresses 
a part of securing Transaction payment on the Cloud. In the 
first part, we describe each control and in the second one, we 
present a small extract of the Cloud Checklist. For the full

CRITICAL VIEW TO THE STANDARD PCI-DSS ON THE 
CLOUD 
Many controls specifications in the 4 domains treated 
above are not specified in any requirement in the recent 
version 3.0 of the PCI-DSS norm. These control 
specifications are: 
 
Network and Infrastructure Services: this control 
specification aims verifying that the Business-critical 
or customer (tenant) impacting (physical and virtual) 
application and system-system interface (API) 
designs and configurations, and infrastructure 
network and systems components, is designed, 
developed, and deployed in accordance with 
mutually agreed-upon service and capacity-level 
expectations, as well as IT governance and service 
management policies and procedures. 
 
Equipment Power Failure: this control specification 
aims verifying Information security measures and 
redundancies are implemented to protect equipment 
from utility service outages (e.g. power failures and 
network disruptions). 
 
Impact Analysis: this control specification aims 
verifying that there is a defined and documented 
method for determining the impact of any disruption 
to the organization that must incorporate the 
following: 
o 
Identify critical products and services 
o 
Identify 
all 
dependencies, 
including 
processes, applications, business partners, 
and third party service providers 
o 
Understand threats to critical products and 
services 
o 
Determine impacts resulting from planned 
or unplanned disruptions and how these 
vary over time 
o 
Establish the maximum tolerable period 
for disruption 
o 
Establish priorities for recovery 
o 
Establish recovery time objectives for 
resumption 
of 
critical 
products 
and 
services within their maximum tolerable 
period of disruption 
o 
Estimate 
the 
resources 
required 
for 
resumption. 
 In the next steps, we will evaluate this new framework 
by applying it on a real Card platform outsourced on the 
Cloud and we check its vulnerability and resilience. 
Afterward, we continue our work by focusing on developing 
recommended requirement for PCI-DSS for these control 
specification that could be added in the next update version 
of the norm. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The goal of the PCI-DSS is to protect cardholder data 
that is processed, stored or transmitted by providers, issuers 
or merchants. The security controls and processes required 
by PCI-DSS are vital for protecting cardholder account data. 
With all the advantages that give Cloud, Issuers, and 
Merchants and any other service providers involved with 
payment card processing must insure that the platform 
virtually and physically is sufficiently protected. 
In this paper, we have developed an exhaustive checklist 
as a tool for any card stakeholder who wants to outsource a 
part or the whole card processing in a Cloud. In the next 
steps of our work, we will focus on evaluating the robustness 
of this framework by applying it on a real application of 
Card Transaction Platform on the Cloud environment. 
Afterward, we will develop recommended requirements for 
PCI-DSS necessary for the Cloud Environment and we will 
release a new Self-Assessment Questionnaire as a reference 
for a Qualified Security Assessor to check in the Cloud 
environment.
