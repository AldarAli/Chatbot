Abstract—This paper presents a systematic approach for
analyzing the bit error probability of a coded orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system in multi-
user channels. A comparative analysis with conventional pilot
patterns, the overlapped pilot pattern and the interlaced pilot
pattern, is developed. Simulation results show that the inter-
laced pilot pattern is more sensitive to the effect of interference,
but also it outperforms the overlapped pilot pattern with
serious interference scenarios.
Keywords-OFDMA, interference, pilot pattern.
I. INTRODUCTION
Multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) is a strong candidate transceiver scheme for
high-speed packet-based multi-user wireless communication
systems, due to its ﬂexibility on subcarrier allocation and
multi-user diversity utilization over multi-path fading chan-
nel [1]. A dynamic channel estimation is necessary before
the demodulation of OFDMA signals since the radio channel
is frequency selective and time-varying for wideband mobile
communication systems [2]. The channel estimation can be
performed by either inserting pilot tones into same positions
or different positions for each user. In the rest of the
paper, we call them as the overlapped pilot pattern and the
interlaced pilot pattern respectively. After channel estimation
is performed in the pilot locations, the channel frequency re-
sponse is typically determined by interpolating the response
between samples obtained using pilot tones. Thus, the de-
sign of pilot pattern is a critical factor in determining the
performance of the OFDMA system. It is well-known that
to achieve theoretically perfect channel estimation, pilots
must be inserted into transmitted OFDMA symbols densely
enough to fulﬁl the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem both
in the frequency domain and in the time domain [3] [4].
Conversely, for a speciﬁc OFDMA conﬁguration and pilot
placement in the frequency domain, the channel propagation
delay dispersion is limited to a speciﬁc range if theoretically
perfect channel estimation is expected. For channels with
larger delay dispersion, there will be irrecoverable channel
estimation error, whose the magnitude is dependent on the
distribution of power conveyed by the channel within and
outside the acceptable propagation delay range [5] [6]. As
justiﬁed above, in designing modern OFDMA systems, it
is crucial to be able to estimate the magnitude of such
unavoidable errors in realistic channel conditions.
In this work our objective is to analyze the performance
of the coded OFDMA system in multi-user channels. The
analysis and results can be extended to the design of pilot
patterns for mesh network [7].
The rest of the paper has been organized as follows.
Section II contains the system model and pilot assisted
channel estimation for the coded OFDMA in multi-user
channels. Section III provides the bit error probability (BEP)
analysis for the coded OFDMA system. Simulation results
are in Section IV. Finally, Section V summarizes our main
results.

A. Channel Model
We consider the wide sense stationary uncorrelated scat-
tering (WSSUS) Rayleigh fading channel. The channel im-
pulse response is represented as
h(t) =
Np−1
X
m=0
cm(t) δ(t − τm),
(5)
where Np is the number of multiple paths, τm and cm(t) are
the time delay and the channel response of the mth multi-
path respectively.
B. Pilot Assisted Channel Estimation
For the channel estimation, the known symbol, so-called
pilot signal, is usually employed. Before the transmission,
pilot signals are uniformly inserted into the data stream.
Upon receiving the corrupted pilot signals at the receiver,
the channel impulse response at pilot locations is estimated.
The channel impulse response at data locations can then be
obtained through interpolation with the pilot channel estima-
tions. Here, we consider the least-squares (LS) estimate for
the channel estimation at a pilot location. The lth estimated
channel response can be obtained as follow:
ˆHl[p] = Yl[p]
Xl[p] = Hl[p] + Zl[p]
Xl[p] = Hl[p] + Vl[p],
(6)
where p denotes the index of pilot subcarrier, Xl[p] is the
pth pilot signal at the lth OFDMA symbol and Yl[p] is the
received symbol corresponding to pilot signal Xl[p].
For the data location, the channel response can be es-
timated by taking interpolation between the pilot channel
estimate. There are several forms to interpolate: uniform,
spline interpolation, and 2D Wiener interpolation etc. Here,
linear interpolation is used [4]. In the linear interpolation,
the data channel estimate is given by
ˆHl[d] =

1 − s
S

ˆHl[p] + s
S
ˆHl[p + 1],
(7)
where d denotes the index of data subcarrier, S is the interval
between pilot subcarriers and s is the distance between the

pth pilot subcarrier and the dth data subcarrier as shown in
Figure 1.
Thus, the transmitted data signal at the dth data subcarrier
in the lth OFDMA symbol can be estimated by
ˆXl[d] = Yl[d]
ˆHl[d]
.
(8)
For two patterns, which are the overlapped pilot pattern
and the interlaced pilot pattern as shown Figure 2, the above
formula can be re-written as follows:
1) Overlapped pilot pattern:
ˆXl[d] = Yl[d]
ˆHl[d]
= Xl[d] + Zl[d]
ˆHl[d]
− Vl[d]Xl[d]
ˆHl[d]
,
(9)
ˆZl[d] = Il[d] + Nl[d],
(10)
Il[d] =
X
i∈κ
H(i)
l [d]X(i)
l [d],
(11)
where Il[d] is the interference of the dth data signal in the
lth OFDMA symbol, H(i)
l [d] and X(i)
l [d] are the channel
response and the data signal of the ith user respectively and
κ is the set of neighbor users.
2) Interlaced pilot pattern:
ˆXl[d1] = Yl[d1]
ˆHl[d1]
= Xl[d1] + Zl[d1]
ˆHl[d1]
− Vl[d1]Xl[d1]
ˆHl[d1]

ˆZl[d1] = Il[d1] + Nl[d1],

ˆXl[d2] = Yl[d2]
ˆHl[d2]
= Xl[d2] + Zl[d2]
ˆHl[d2]
− Vl[d2]Xl[d2]
ˆHl[d2]

ˆZl[d2] = Il[d2] + Nl[d2],
(16)
Il[d2] =
X
i∈κ
H(i)
l [d2]X(i)
l [d2],
(17)
where j is the user index that the jth user’s pilot signal is
the interference.
For the interlaced pilot pattern, we can divide the data
signals into two parts. The ﬁrst part is the region that one
of neighbor user’s pilot signal and another neighbor users’
data signals are interference. The second part is the region
that all of neighbor users’ data signals are interference. The
ﬁrst part gets more interference than second part because the
pilot power is boosted for accurate channel estimation. At
the above equations, we denote d1 as data signal index in
the ﬁrst part and d2 as data signal index in the second part.
C. Pilot Assisted Channel Estimation for Multi-user
For a single user case, it’s obvious that more pilot signals
leads to better performance but with sacriﬁcing in symbol
rate. Therefore the number of pilots is a trade-off between
channel estimation accuracy and bandwidth efﬁciency. How-
ever, for multi-user case, it’s not obvious that more pilot
signals outperform less pilot signals due to interference
between users. If pilot signals are corrupted, data fail to
be demodulated irrespective of correcting processes such as
despreading and decoding. Also, signal to interference ratio
remains the same in the overlapped pilot pattern regardless
of pilot power boost-up. The solution is to make the pilots
from different users not to collide each other because pilot
signals are relatively stronger than spread data signals. The
channel performance estimation is improved by reducing the
number of pilot signal collisions. However better channel
performance estimation dose not always guarantee better
data detection performance. The interference of pilot region
and the interference of data region is trade-off.
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF CODED OFDMA
SYSTEMS
A. Coded OFDMA System
Error correcting coding is an essential part of an OFDMA
system for mobile communication. OFDMA in a fading
environment is almost always used with coding to improve
its performance and as such is often referred to as Coded
OFDMA or COFDMA. For an uncoded OFDMA system
in a frequency selective Rayleigh-fading environment, each
OFDMA subcarrier has a ﬂat-fading channel. Accordingly,
the average probability of error for an uncoded OFDMA
system is the same as that for a ﬂat-fading single-carrier
system with the same average geometric mean of SNR.
Just as we can introduce time diversity through coding and
interleaving in a ﬂat-fading single-carrier system, we can in-
troduce frequency diversity through coding and interleaving
across subcarriers in an OFDMA system. However, since
OFDMA in itself does not increase the system bandwidth
it can never introduce frequency diversity on ﬂat fading
channels.
With coding and interleaving across subcarriers, the strong
subcarriers help the weak ones as the block fading effect
is decreased. Thus overall data detection performance is
dependent on the ratio of strong part and weak part such
as coding rate.
B. Bit Error Probability Analysis with Simple Bound
To compare the performance of the overlapped pilot
pattern and the interlaced pilot pattern, we consider the
simple bound derived in [8]. Here, we use (n, k) block code
that maps each k information bits into n codeword bits.
Then the simple bound on the bit-error rate is given by
Pb(E) =
n−k+1

and the exponent of the simple bound is expressed by

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
For the simulation, we use (7,4) hamming code as an
error correcting code. The channel estimation is performed
by using LS estimator and the ﬂat fading channel model is
used.
Figures 3-7 give the BEP performance of two coded
patterns using overlapped pilots and interlaced pilots for
channel estimation, and uncoded BPSK in [3]. Eb/N0 is the
ratio of Energy per Bit (Eb) to the Spectral Noise Density
(N0). These results show that the BEP performance of the
overlapped pilot pattern is relatively less susceptible to the
number of users, but the BEP performance of the interlaced
pilot pattern can be sensitive to the number of users, mainly
due to the effect of interference.
The effect of pilot power boosting can be observed from
Figure 3 and Figure 6. For the overlapped pilot pattern, the
performance dose not improved as pilot power increase. The
reason for this is that the pilot power of interference users

the performance of the interlaced pilot pattern is better than
that of the overlapped pilot pattern is increased as the pilot
gap and the number of user are increased.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we analyze the performance of the over-
lapped pilot pattern and the interlaced pilot pattern for
channel estimation. This comparison is of special interest
since the pilot pattern affects the performance of OFDMA
systems. Simulation results in terms of BEP corroborate
our theoretical analysis. We notice that the interlaced pilot
pattern is more suitable for the multi-user networks like
mesh network in which serious interference exists. We
