Abstract—When interacting with an application, users expect
to
complete
the
desired
tasks
securely
with
minimal
interference from the actions required to ensure security and
privacy. Previous research confirmed that there is a tradeoff
between the security and usability of an application. Although
numerous
user
studies
examined
various
authentication
methods, such as alphanumeric password, graphical password,
and biometrics, very limited research investigated users’
performance and perception when they were allowed to choose
the authentication method(s) for a specific application. This
study investigates how users interact with and perceive the
‘authentication of choice’ method when using a mobile device.
75 participants completed an online study that compared three
different authentication designs: alphanumeric username and
password, one-factor authentication of choice, and two-factor
authentication of choice. The result of the study confirms the
tradeoff between security and usability in the design of
authentication mechanisms. The result also indicates that the
‘authentication of choice’ approach has the potential to offer a
solution that provides the desired balance between usability
and security.

INTRODUCTION
Security can be defined as the concepts, techniques,
technical measures, and administrative measures used to
protect information assets from deliberate or advertent
unauthorized use, destruction, disclosure, or alteration [1].
With the continuous increase in security threats, it is crucial
to incorporate security measures into the system design to
ensure the security of both the system and the information
that resides in the system. Authentication is the process of
identifying an individual process or entity that is attempting
to log in to a secure domain. One goal of authentication
design is to ensure users can perform their primary tasks
securely with minimal interference [2][3]. Previous research
confirmed the tradeoff between the security and usability of
common
authentication
methods
currently
in
use.
A
particular
measure
that
improves
the
security
of
the
authentication mechanism usually has a negative effect on
the usability of the system [4].
Due to the huge variation in the user abilities and
preferences, the nature of tasks and devices, and the context
of use, the authentication process should not be one-size-fits
-all. An authentication method that is usable for a specific
user in a particular context may not be usable for other users
in another context. For the same reason, an authentication
method that is considered by some users to be sufficiently
secure may not be secure enough for other users. When
choosing an authentication method, the user’s preference
between the security and usability of the authentication
method may affect their decision. To make a system usable
and secure, system developers need to go beyond the
traditional human-centered design techniques and adopt
design techniques that allow users to make decisions [5].
Although numerous user studies had examined various
authentication methods, such as alphanumeric password [6]
[7], graphical password [8][9], and biometrics [10] [11], very
limited
research
investigated
users’
performance
and
preference
when
they
were
allowed
to
choose
the
authentication method(s) for a specific application [12] [13].
We
conducted
an
online
empirical
study
to
provide
preliminary understanding of the ‘Authentication of Choice’
(AoC)
approach
in
the
context
of
mobile
devices.
Authentication of choice is an authentication concept that
allows
users
to
select
their
preferred
authentication
method(s) out of various methods provided. Three different
authentication
designs
were
examined:
traditional
alphanumeric
username
and
password,
one-factor
authentication of choice, and two-factor authentication of
choice. Preliminary results of the study including the
participants’ preference over the three authentication designs
and the specific authentication methods chosen under the
‘authentication of choice’ conditions were reported in [14].
This paper presents the performance measures including
login time and failed login attempts. More importantly, we
present and analyze participants’ response to a series of
questions that reveals their perception of usability and
security in the context of mobile devices as well as how their
perception
affected
their
decision
when
using
the
‘Authentication of Choice’ methods.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
reviews the literature on authentication methods currently in
use and the study related to authentication of choice. We
discuss the research methodology for this study in Section III
of the paper and the result of the study in Section IV. We
addressed the result of the study in Section V of the paper
and the conclusion in Section VI.

RELATED WORK
There are different authentication methods currently in
use. In this section, we review the literature on common
authentication methods.
A.
Authentication on Mobile Devices
There has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile
phones. It was reported in 2016 that almost two-thirds of the
world’s population has a mobile phone [15]. Mobile devices
have improved the quality of life by providing a variety of
services anytime and anywhere. However, the mobility and
portability of mobile devices pose a significant threat to the
privacy and security of the information stored on the device
[16]. User authentication is one of the security measures to
mitigate the threat to security and privacy of the information
on
mobile
devices.
The
most
popular
authentication
approach
on
mobile
devices
is
knowledge-based
authentication methods, such as Personal Identification
Number
(PIN),
password,
and
pattern
or
graphical
passwords. More recently, fingerprint authentication and
facial authentication have been widely adopted as well [17].
B. Authentication Methods
There are various authentication methods currently in
use. These authentication methods are broadly categorized
into
four
groups
based
on
the
factors
required
for
authentication:
I.
Knowledge-based Authentication
Knowledge-based authentication uses the information
that users must know to verify their identity to the system.
Authentication methods in this category require users to be
able to recollect some information before gaining access to
the system. This is done in form of challenge and response,
in which the user responds to the challenge with something
he knows [18]. Examples of knowledge-based authentication
include
numeric
password,
also
referred
to
as
PIN,
alphanumeric password, or graphical password. Knowledge-
based authentication methods are the most popular form of
authentication because they are relatively easy to implement
and have lower operating costs [19]. The major limitation of
this type of authentication is the memorability requirement.
Users have to commit information to memory and recollect
the information during the authentication process. This
memorability problem does affect the usability and security
of knowledge-based authentication methods [18]. Users find
it difficult to remember password or PIN and many end up
writing down their passwords or choose simple passwords
that may result in the compromise of the system security.
II. Inherent factors authentication
Inherent
factors
authentication,
also
known
as
biometrics, uses the physiological or behavioral traits of the
user for authentication. These traits include fingerprint, iris,
retina, voice, face, signature, typing patterns, physical
movement,
etc.
[20].
To
enroll
users
for
biometric
authentication, the feature to be used will be captured,
processed, and stored in the computer as a baseline to
compare
with
the
newly
captured
biometrics
during
authentication [21].
Biometric authentication is relatively more usable and
secure compared to knowledge-based authentication [22].
One of the challenges of the biometric authentication
approach is that once the factor is compromised, the factor
will remain compromised forever. There is no way that the
user can change his fingerprint like in the case of knowledge-
based or possession-based authentication [22]. Another
problem with inherent factor authentication is that the user’s
environment can affect the efficacy of the authentication
method [23]. For instance, a health worker in the emergency
room wearing gloves and masks may not be able to use
fingerprint or face recognition for authentication until they
remove their gloves or face mask.
III. Possession-based Authentication
The possession-based authentication, also known as
token-based authentication, relies on what users have or
possess for authentication. Examples of possession include a
token,
smart
card,
common
access
card,
etc.
This
authentication approach can be used on the stationary
computer as a stand-alone device, plug into the computer
through the USB port, or installed on a mobile device as an
application. The token is widely used in mobile devices. This
can be stand-alone hardware or software-based token. The
token has a unique cryptographic secret embedded in it that
can be used to authenticate using the challenge-response
handshake system [24]. If the token device is broken, the key
becomes invalid [25]. This authentication approach is
relatively more acceptable to users compared to other
authentication methods, but it is more difficult to manage,
and the device can get lost, stolen or shared [26].
IV. Location-based Authentication
Location-based
authentication
involves
using
the
geographical location of the user or device to authenticate
and validate access to the information system. A common
implementation of this approach is when banks deny
customer transactions on their debit or credit card in an
unauthorized location until the customer calls the bank to
provide additional validation. This authentication approach
can provide an additional level of security for the system by
preventing access from unauthorized areas, but it is not easy
to implement and has to be combined with another
authentication approach to identify a specific user [27].
Location-based authentication requires a large number of
databases and access towers to function effectively [28].
C. Multifactor Authentication Method
Multifactor authentication is a combination of two or
more authentication methods to authenticate a user. This was
introduced because of the insufficient level of security
provided by single-factor authentication [29]. Multifactor
authentication provides a higher level of security especially
346
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-761-0
ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

for government and military systems as well as other critical
information systems [30]. Combining two or more factors of
authentication increases the security of the system, but does
affect the usability of the system [31].
D. Authentication of Choice
There is no perfect authentication method that can
accommodate the needs of all users [32]. A system designer
cannot design a universally accessible authentication method
for users without knowing their abilities and disabilities [12].
People have different preferences for authentication methods
based on their cognitive skills or physical abilities [13].
Systems are usually designed with one authentication
method selected out of a variety of authentication methods
that are currently in use. To enhance the security of the
system, some systems adopted two-factor authentication that
requires a higher workload from the user [32]. In either one-
factor or two-factor authentication, providing the freedom of
choice in selecting the authentication method(s) preferred by
the individual user may improve the usability and the
security of the system [14]. To date, there is no known
research on the authentication of choice approach. We
conducted the following study as an initial attempt to fill in
this gap by collecting preliminary data on user performance,
preference, and perception of AoC methods on mobile
devices.
III.
METHODOLOGY
The study was conducted electronically. A within-group
design was adopted with three conditions for authentication:
-
Alphanumeric username and password
-
One-factor AoC: In this condition, participants chose
one
authentication
method
out
of
five
options:
alphanumeric password, PIN, fingerprint authentication,
facial recognition, and One Time Password (OTP).
-
Two-factor AoC: In this condition, participants chose
two authentication methods out of the five options listed
above.
A.
Participants
75 participants completed the study. Participants did not
receive any financial or other types of incentives for taking
part in the study. The participants for the study were selected
randomly. The age of participants varies, with 47 participants
in the age range of 18-30 years, 18 in the range of 31-40
years, 8 in the range of 41-50 years and 2 above 50. Out of
the 75 participants, 43 claimed they were male while 32
claimed
to
be
female.
71
of
the
participants
were
professionals working in various fields, such as business,
education, science, engineering and IT, and healthcare. Three
participants were students. One participant did not identify
his/her
career.
Regarding
educational
background,
31
participants claimed to have a high school diploma, 33
participants had bachelor degree and 11 participants had
postgraduate degrees. The level of information security
experience of the participants varies: 28 participants claimed
themselves as experts, 23 with intermediate knowledge, and
23 with basic level of experience. One participant did not
respond to this question.
B.
Event Manager Application
An Android-based mobile device application called
‘Event Manager’ was developed to provide a realistic setting
for
this
study.
The
‘Event
Manager’
supports
five
authentication
methods
and
provides
a
calendar
for
managing daily schedule. The calendar function was chosen
because it was available on almost all mobile phones and its’
security and privacy related expectation was representative
of many tasks conducted on mobile devices on a daily basis.
The five authentication methods supported are commonly
adopted on mobile devices:
-
Alphanumeric username and password
-
PIN
-
Fingerprint authentication
-
Facial recognition
-
One-Time-Password (OTP)
The design of the application followed general usability
guidelines and underwent several rounds of refinement based
on users’ feedback. The home page and the registration page
of the application are demonstrated in Figure 1 (a and b).
Users can create three types of accounts on the application
using the same email:
Type 1 (T1): Alphanumeric username and password
Type 2 (T2): One-factor AoC out of five options
Type 3 (T3): Two-factor AoC out of five options
Figure 1. (a) Home page and (b) Registration page.
C.
Procedure
This study was conducted electronically. Instructions for
the study and the questionnaire link were sent out to
participants via email. After providing consent to take part in
the study, participants first downloaded the ‘Event Manager’
app from Google Play and installed it on their Android
phones. Then, each participant created and logged into an
account under all three conditions. After they logged into an
347

account, they added or revised an event on the calendar. The
order of the three conditions was counterbalanced among the
participants
to
control
the
learning
effect.
After
the
participants completed the tasks under all 3 conditions, they
answered
a
questionnaire
via
a
Google
Form.
The
questionnaire
collected
participants’
demographic
information, their general attitude toward security and
privacy, their security-related practice on their mobile
devices, and their preference and perception towards the
AoC approach. The authentication methods chosen during
the two AoC conditions, the time it took to login, and the
outcome of the login attempt were automatically logged by
the application.
IV.
RESULTS
In this section, we discuss the result of the study using
the data obtained from the Event Manager application and
the questionnaire completed by participants.
A.
Login time and failed attempts
A One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA test using
login time as the dependent variable and condition as the
independent variable suggests that there is significant
difference in the login time under the three conditions (F (2,
148) = 56.80, p < 0.001). Post hoc Least Significant
Difference (LSD) tests suggest that the participants took
significantly longer time to login under the alphanumeric
username/password condition than the one-factor AoC
condition (p < 0.001) and the two-factor AoC condition (p <
0.05). Participants also took significantly longer time to login
under the two-factor AoC condition than the one-factor
condition (p < 0.001).
Figure 2. Login time for the three authentication conditions.
Failed login attempts rarely occurred during the study.
There
were
five
instances
of
incorrect
alphanumeric
password, two instances of unrecognized fingerprint, and
two instances of unrecognized face.
B.
Attitude toward security and usability
Participants were asked to rate the importance of security
and privacy of their information; 67 (89%) participants
claimed that it was very important, 5 (7%) claimed it as
fairly important while 3 (4%) claimed it as important. When
asked about the importance of security of their mobile phone,
69 (92%) participants rated it as very important, 4 (5%) as
fairly important, 1 (1%) as important while the remaining 1
(1%) as slightly important.
Participants rated the level of importance regarding the
security and ease of use of the authentication method on their
mobile phone. Table I illustrates the number of participants
that ranked the importance of security and ease of use at a
specific level. Out of 75 participants, 69 (92%) believed
security is very important and the remaining 6 (8%) claimed
that is it fairly important. 63 (84%) participants claimed ease
of use is very important, 6 (8%) participants claimed it as
fairly important and the remaining 6 (8%) claimed it as
important.

As illustrated in Table IV, the majority of the participants
chose fingerprint as the most secure (67%) and the easiest to
use (56%) authentication method. The second on the list is
facial authentication, with 18 participants choosing it as the
most secure and 23 participants as the easiest to use. All the
other
methods
received
much
fewer
votes
on
both
perspectives. No participant chose OTP to be the most secure
or easiest to use.
Participants were asked to rank four criteria for selecting
an authentication method on a mobile phone, namely
efficiency, ease of use, security, and memorability. Table IV
illustrates how participants ranked the four criteria. Security
was chosen to be the top rank criteria when selecting an
authentication method by 56 (75%) participants, followed by
the ease of use, efficiency, and memorability.

Participants ranked their preference towards the three
authentication conditions. The results were reported in [6].
Participants overwhelmingly preferred the one-factor AoC
condition over the other two conditions. 63 participants
chose the one-factor AoC as their top choice while 9 selected
the two-factor AoC and 3 selected the alphanumeric
password method. To further understand their preference, we
asked participants to select the possible reasons behind their
ranking. Four possible reasons were provided: efficiency,
ease of use, security, and memorability. Participants could
check multiple reasons that applied. Table V illustrates the
number of participants that selected each condition as their
top preference and the number of participants in that group
who selected each specific reason.

Among the 63 participants who chose one-factor AoC as
their top preference, 54 participants selected security and 51
selected ease of use as one of the reasons for their decision,
suggesting that the two factors are the dominant factors in
the decision making process regarding the selection of
authentication approach on mobile phones.
Finally, we asked participants whether two-factor AoC
improves the security of the system, requires too much time
for authentication, is difficult to remember, or difficult to
use. We asked these questions to evaluate their perception of
the two-factor AoC approach.

disagreed that the two-factor AoC was difficult to remember,
5 agreed and 11 were neutral. 55 participants disagreed that
using two-factor AoC made the authentication process
difficult, 8 agreed and 11 were neutral.
V.
DISCUSSION
The results suggested that, on a mobile phone, both the
one-factor authentication and the two-factor authentication
are significantly more efficient than the alphanumeric
password method. The participants highly valued security
and privacy both from the general perspective and in the
specific context of mobile phone usage.
The study revealed an interesting contradiction between
users’ perception about security and their actual security
decision. 92% of participants rated security as very important
in general and 75% chose security as their most important
criteria when selecting an authentication method for their
mobile phone. However, 84% of the participants prefer one-
factor AoC over two-factor AoC even though 89% of them
agreed that two-factor AoC could improve the security of the
device. This finding suggests that users should not be
expected to choose the most secure authentication method
available even though they highly value security. The reason
could be attributed to the classic tradeoff between security
and usability. In this study, 51 out of the 63 participants who
chose one-factor AoC as their top preference selected ‘ease
of use’ as one of the reasons for their decision. So, between
one-factor and two-factor authentication, it seems that most
users would prefer the one-factor AoC due to its efficiency
and reduced cognitive load.
One-factor AoC may not support the level of security
protection
desired
or
required
by
many
institutions,
businesses, or individual users. In those cases, is it feasible to
require two-factor AoC? The finding of the study provides a
positive answer to that question. Although the participants
overwhelmingly preferred one-factor AoC over two-factor
349
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-761-0
ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

AoC, their perception about two-factor AoC is highly
positive. 89% of the participants thought two-factor AoC
could improve security. 71% and 92% of the participants
were fine with the efficiency and memorability of two-factor
AoC, respectively. 87% thought the general usability of the
two-factor AoC was acceptable. Therefore, when one-factor
AoC is not an option, it is quite likely that users would adopt
two-factor AoC and find it usable.
As a preliminary investigation of the authentication of
choice approach, this study has several limitations that need
to be addressed through future research. First, the study only
involved
Android
users and
the results may not be
generalizable to users of other platforms. Second, the
authentication methods supported were either knowledge-
based or biometrics. Possession-based and location-based
authentication methods were not examined. Third, because
the participants logged into each account only once during
the study, the result only applies to the very initial interaction
with the different authentication options. We are planning a
one-month longitudinal study to examine the AoC approach
in a more realistic setting.
VI.
CONCLUSION
This study provided insights about user performance,
preferences, and perception of the authentication of choice
approach on mobile devices during their initial interaction
with this approach. The efficiency and the user subjective
perception suggest that the AoC approach has the potential to
serve as a usable and secure authentication solution on
mobile devices. Although users overwhelmingly prefer the
one-factor AoC over two-factor AoC, they are likely to adopt
the two-factor AoC when a higher level of security
protection is desired or required. Future research is needed to
confirm the findings of this study on other platforms and
longer period of user interaction.
