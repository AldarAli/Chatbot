Abstract—Working Memory (WM) and cognitive functions 
decrease with age. Although WM training has been 
extensively studied, transfer effects to other cognitive 
functions are still inconclusive. We examined whether 10 
sessions of N-Back training could improve not only the 
trained task but also lead to significant transfer effects to 
similar cognitive functions (near-transfer), such as spatial 
memory, and to different cognitive functions, such as 
intelligence and attention (far-transfer). We analyzed 
behavioral, as well as electroencephalogram (EEG) data 
recorded during task performance. Our results showed 
significant differences in N-Back performance and near-
transfer effects, but no evidence for far-transfer effects.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Working Memory (WM) has been intensively 
researched in the last decade. Baddeley [1] describes WM 
as a brain system that provides temporary storage and 
manipulation of information necessary to complete 
complex tasks. With age, cognitive functioning has been 
shown to decline especially in terms of WM as it is the 
earliest symptom a person experiences [2]. The possibility 
to trigger the aging brain’s plasticity processes by cognitive 
training seems promising as several studies reported a 
slowdown in WM decline [3][4] and even an improved 
cognitive functioning [4][5].  
Following a series of studies, it has been reported that, 
after intensive WM training, improvements in the trained 
task can be obtained [3], although a generalization to other 
non-trained functions (transfer effects) is still unclear 
[6][7]. Jaeggi et al. [7][8] used an N-Back task for cognitive 
training and showed improvements not only in the trained 
task but also transfer effects to other cognitive functions, 
such as fluid intelligence. The latter is an example of a far-
transfer effect as the brain regions activated during N-Back 
task performance overlap only slightly with those involved 
in fluid intelligence [7]. In support of the overlap theory, 
previous studies assume a partial overlap with the fronto-
parietal network to be sufficient to exhibit also an 
improvement in other cognitive functions. A second 
hypothesis states that WM training effects transfer only if 
cognitive training improves specific cognitive processes 
required in both training and transfer tasks. Dahlin et al. [9] 
found transfer, after WM updating training, to an N-Back 
task that resembled the original trained task in also relying 
on updating processes (near-transfer effect), but not to a 
Stroop task that involved inhibition but no updating.    
Motivated by the previous findings on the effectiveness 
of the N-Back task [10], we decided to also use it in our 
cognitive training experiment. The N-back task was 
originally developed by Wayne Kirchner in 1958 [11] as a 
four load factors (‘‘0-Back’’ to ‘‘3-Back’’) visuo-spatial 
task for measuring WM. The N-Back task involves 
different 
processes, 
such 
encoding, 
monitoring, 
maintenance, updating of the sequence, and stimulus 
matching. It reflects a number of core Executive Functions 
(EFs), besides working memory, such as inhibitory control 
and cognitive flexibility, problem solving, decision 
making, selective attention, and other functions [12]. The 
task requires participants to maintain stimulus information 
and decide if the currently shown picture is the same as the 
one presented N times before (Figure 1). Owen et al. [6] 
reported the following brain areas to be activated during

this task in healthy subjects: lateral premotor cortex, dorsal 
cingulate and medial premotor cortex, dorsolateral and 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal poles, and the 
medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex. 
The N-Back task can be measured behaviorally and 
with EEG. Brouwer et al. [13] showed a clear 
differentiation between N-Back levels and the amplitudes 
of certain Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). In particular, 
the P300 component, defined as a positive deflection in 
EEG amplitude that appears approximately 300 ms after 
stimulus presentation. The P300 amplitude is inversely 
proportional to task difficulty level. P300 has been related 
to updating working memory [14], executive functions 
[15], and stimulus evaluation and categorization [16]. 
In the present study, we examined whether N-Back 
training improves the trained task in healthy older adults 
compared to a passive control group that did not undergo 
any training, and whether we could detect near- and far-
transfer effects to untrained cognitive functions. We 
hypothesize improvements in the trained task and near/far-
transfer effects in the training group, but no significant 
outcomes for the passive control group.  
In Section 2, we describe the materials and methods 
used in our study. In Section 3, we report our results and 
discuss them briefly, and formulate our conclusions, in 
Section 4. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In this section, we describe our subject recruitment, 
used cognitive tests, N-Back training, and EEG recording. 
A. Subjects  
We recruited 15 healthy older participants (9 females 
and 6 males), between 55 and 70 years old (M = 60.98, SD 
= 0.11) from Senior Centers in Leuven, Belgium (Table 1). 
The selection criteria were: Mini Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) score above 27, no history of neurological or 
psychiatric diseases, no experience with WM training, 
normal vision, and not taking any medication that could 
interfere with cognitive functioning. Power estimation for 
sample size was calculated and indicated N = 8 based on 
accuracy, and N = 8 based on ERP-P300, in the case of the 
pre-post N-Back task. Our participants were assigned to 
either a training group (N = 8) or a passive control group 
(N = 7). The passive control group only completed two 
sessions of cognitive testing and did not undergo any WM 
training. The training group completed 10 sessions of WM 
training in 4 weeks, and performed 2 sessions of cognitive 
tests before and after training. During the first session, 
participants were informed about the goals of our study and 
what would be done with the recorded data. When they 
agreed to participate, they read and signed the informed 
consent form. The study was prior approved by our 
university hospital’s ethical committee.

B. Pre-post cognitive tests 
The battery of cognitive tests included the Test Of 
Variables of Attention (TOVA), CORSI and RAVEN tests, 
and was used to detect behavioral differences before and 
after training, in the training and control group. The TOVA 
test is a cognitive test that gauges attention [19], the CORSI 
block tapping test is used to assess visuo-spatial short-term 
WM [20], and the RAVEN test is used for measuring 
abstract reasoning and intelligence [21]. The CORSI test is 
used to assess near-transfer effects, the TOVA and 
RAVEN tests to assess far-transfer effects.  
C. N-Back task 
Considering the encouraging results of Jaeggi et al. 
[7][8], using a N-Back task, subjects were administered an 
adapted version of the N-Back task shown in Figure 1. 
Participants had to decide whether the presented picture is 
the same as the one presented N times before. The task was 
divided into four difficulty levels (0-back, 1-back, 2-back 
and 3-back). Each level consisted of 100 stimuli (i.e., 
meaningful drawings) presented in pseudorandom order. 
Participants were required to have answered 70% of the 
current trials correctly before passing to the next level. For 
each block of 100 stimuli, 33% of them were target and the 
stimuli were presented during 1 s followed by a 1.5 s inter-
stimulus interval (ISI) and 0.5 s of feedback presentation 
(red frowny/green smiley). Between stimuli, participants 
were shown a crosshair centered on the screen. They 
received a monetary reward (max 20 euros per session) and 
were informed of the reward at the end of each session. In 
total, there were 10 sessions of N-Back training for 4 
weeks.

D. EEG Recordings 
EEG was recorded continuously with a SynAmpsRT 
device (Compumedics, Australia (www.compumedics. 
com.au)) at a sampling rate of 2kHz and using 32 Ag/AgCl 
electrodes. The electrodes were placed at O1, Oz, O2, PO3, 
P8, P4, Pz, P3, P7, TP9, CP5, CP1, CP2, CP6, TP10, T7, 
C3, Cz, C4, T8, FC6, FC2, FC1, FC5, F3, Fz, F4, AF3, 
AF4, Fp1, Fp2, with the reference placed at AFz and the 
ground at CPz. We placed four electrodes around the eyes 
for Electro-Oculogram Recording (EOG) following the 
instructions given by Croft and Barry [22] for removing 
eye movement and blinking artifacts [23]. The recorded 
EEG signal was re-referenced oﬄine to the average of the 
two mastoid signals (average mastoid reference, TP9 & 
TP10), band-pass filtered in the 0.1 – 30 Hz range, and cut 
into epochs starting from 100 ms pre- till 1500 ms post-
stimulus onset. Baseline correction was performed by 
subtracting the average of the 100 ms pre-stimulus onset 
activity from the 1500 ms post-stimulus onset activity. 
Finally, the epochs were downsampled to 1000 Hz and 
stored for ERP component detection. A two-way ANOVA 
(N-Back level x session) was applied to the P300 
amplitudes, calculated as the average over a time window 
between 250-400 ms, for channels Fz, Cz and Pz. Epochs 
with incorrect behavioral responses were excluded from 
further analysis. In addition, epochs with EEG signals 
greater than 50µV were also excluded as they could be 
motion artifacts. 
III. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we discuss the results of N-Back training 
and near/far-transfer effects to other cognitive tasks.  
A. Behavioral Responses - training 
To assess differences in behavioral performance of 
healthy older subjects that underwent N-Back training, we 
examined the response accuracy and Reaction Time (RT) 
of our participants. We hypothesize that RT decreases and 
accuracy level increases following N-Back training. The 
responses to the stimuli were divided into four categories: 
hit (target and button press), false alarm (non-target and 
button press), correct rejection (non-target and no button 
press), and miss (target and no button press). We performed 
a two-way ANOVA looking at the interaction between 
sessions and N-Back level, and we found a significant 
effect of accuracy for N-Back level (F(2) = 12.2, p<0.001), 
sessions (F(9) = 9.93, p<0.001), and for the interaction N-
Back x sessions (F(27) = 3.57, p<0.001). For RT we found 
significant results for N-Back level (F(2) = 6.98, p<0.05) 
and sessions (F(9) = 10.09, p<0.001). Both findings 
confirm that cognitive training increases accuracy and 
reduces RT of healthy older subjects (Figure 2).  
B. ERPs responses - training 
As several studies showed that, during an N-Back task 
performance, the most activated brain regions are the 
lateral premotor cortex, dorsal cingulate and medial 
premotor cortex, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex, frontal poles, and medial and lateral posterior 
parietal cortex [6], and that the P300 amplitude is defined 
over the midline electrodes (channels Fz (frontal), Pz 
(posterior), and Cz (central)), we decided to analyze the 
P300 amplitude using a 32 electrodes cap that covered 
these brain areas. Furthermore, as Dahlin et al. [9] reported 
that training with an N-Back task improves WM in older 
healthy subjects, based on a functional Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, we hypothesize that the 
P300 amplitude increases at the end of the training. Grand-
averaged epochs (time window between 250 and 400 ms) 
for target to non-target trials, for each difficulty level of the 
N-Back task (0, 1, 2, and 3), are shown in Figure 3. A two-
way ANOVA (N-Back level x time) was used to detect 
significant modulations of P300 amplitude, for all three 
channels (Fz, Cz, Pz). Based on our results, we observed 
that the P300 amplitude changed significantly pre-post 
training mostly for central and posterior (Cz and Pz) 
channels. We found significant results pre-post training 
in channel Cz (F(1) = 11.7, p<0.001) for 2-Back, and in 
channel Pz (F(1) = 7.37, p<0.05) for 2-Back, and (F(1) = 
3.83, p<0.05) for 3-Back. No significant pre-post training 
differences were found for channel Fz.

C. Pre-post tests- transfer effects 
To test whether we could find any transfer effects, we 
administered pre-post training tests and performed a paired 
t-test analysis, intra- and inter-group (Table 2). We found 
significant effects for N-Back (p = 0.000157) and CORSI 
(p = 0.01), thus evidence for a near-transfer effect. In the 
passive control group, we did not find any significant 
effects. Furthermore, the comparison between the two 
groups showed significant differences only for the trained 
task (N-Back) with p = 2.78 x 10 (-05) (p<0.001).

We also run a two-way ANOVA analysis (N-Back x 
sessions) for pre-post training tests, see Figure 4, and 
found significant differences between groups in the trained 
task (N-Back task) per session (F(1) = 12.73, p<0.05) and 
more interestingly for the interaction between N-Back x 
sessions (F(1) = 0.0078, p<0.05). 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The aim of our study was to determine whether N-Back 
training of healthy older adults improves not only the 
trained task, compared to a passive control group, but also 
yield near- and far-transfer effects to untrained cognitive 
functions (spatial memory task, attention and reasoning and 
intelligence). We had two groups of healthy older subjects: 
one group performed 10 sessions of N-Back training and 
another group was not trained (passive control group). Both 
groups were administered a battery of cognitive tests 
(CORSI, TOVA, RAVEN). The first group pre- and post-
training for which case we expected to find significant 
differences [28][29]. We found significant evidence for 
near-transfer effects to spatial memory (CORSI), based on 
accuracy level, but no evidence for far-transfer effects. This 
could be due to our small sample size. The results are in 
line with those of Dahlin et al. [9] who observed that 
working memory training improves performance in related 
cognitive tasks, such as spatial memory, but not in other 
cognitive functions. Furthermore, the N-Back task (trained 
task) improved significantly in accuracy and RT in the 
trained group compared to the passive control group. 
Besides the behavioral findings, the P300 ERP results also 
showed a significant effect pre-post training, especially for 
2-Back in the central and parietal channels. As expected 
[23], we could observe clear differences in P300 
amplitudes for different N-Back levels, thus, supporting the 
results of Colom et al. [24] and Salminen et al. [25] who 
reported improvements after an N-Back training in healthy 
adults.  
The novelty of our study was to add the P300 ERP 
component, by looking at pre-post differences after N-Back 
training. As mentioned before, we found significant 
differences for the 2-Back task, showing that this task level 
could be important to improve WM in older subjects. 
Future research could look more into detail at differences 
in pre-post training in the 2-Back task of healthy older 
subjects and repeat the experiment in patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
as it is known that these patients have significant 
difficulties in WM [26]. Reducing cognitive decline in 
MCI patients could delay the diagnosis of AD, as we know 
that MCI patients have a high risk to convert to clinically-
probable AD in a few years’ time [27]. In light of our 
results, N-Back training could be an effective tool for 
improving WM and related cognitive functions and for 
delaying cognitive decline. Furthermore, another point that 
we would like to suggest for future research is to test 
whether by using a specific strategy during an N-Back 
training could achieve significant transfer effects in 
untrained cognitive tasks, as there is a gap in the literature 
about what WM training strategies to use. What we do 
know is that the strategy of mental rehearsal has been 
proven to be effective in enhancing performance [28].
