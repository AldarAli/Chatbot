Abstract— Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (m-
MIMO) is a promising technique for operating fifth-generation 
wireless networks (5G). However, this technique suffers from 
the radio frequency chain's higher cost and processing 
complexity. One solution to deal with this problem is improving 
the antenna selection method. Nevertheless, many antenna 
selection methods require knowledge of channel state 
information (CSI) to select the best performing antenna subset. 
Which is impossible due to the driver contamination issue in m-
MIMO. Furthermore, the exhaustive search method used in 
conventional multiple-Input Multiple-Output is inefficient for 
the m-MIMO system. Consequently, this paper proposes an 
optimal selection algorithm for determining the best subset of 
antennas at the receiver when CSI is unavailable. For this 
purpose, we propose a water-filling algorithm based on the 
mutual information maximization criterion and Raptor-
decoded symbols. Numerical results show that our proposed 
selection algorithm attains close to optimal values as the 
exhaustive search method.

 INTRODUCTION 
Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (m-MIMO) is a 
promising technique that uses hundreds of antennas at the 
transmitter and receiver to improve channel performance in 
Fifth Generation (5G) wireless networks. m-MIMO 
demonstrates improved link reliability, data rate, and radiated 
energy efficiency than conventional systems [1]. However, 
the large number of antennas requires the addition of radio 
frequency (RF) chain elements at both links, increasing the 
cost and system complexity of m-MIMO. An antenna 
selection method is used in MIMO conventional to address 
this issue. A practical solution where a subset of the available 
antennas at the transmitter and receiver are chosen on a 
predefined selection criterion to minimize the system 
complexity and cost in MIMO [2] [3]. The successive 
selection method, an exhaustive search method, is the most 
used in these systems for its optimality to find the most 
performant subset of antennas. However, this method is 
inefficient for the massive MIMO system because of the 
significant number of antennas which introduce complexity 
in the processing. Therefore, an efficient antenna selection 
algorithm that performs an affordable computational cost is 
required in m-MIMO. 
Several solutions have been proposed in the literature to 
fix the antenna selection methods problem in m-MIMO. One 
of those studies used a maximum sum-rate criterion to find 
the optimal number of antennas [4]. Another paper proposed 
the maximisation of capacity/sum-rate as the selection 
criteria for transmitting antennas in massive MIMO's 
downlink 
[5]. 
This 
later 
study 
performed 
several 
measurement campaigns in the 2.6 GHz frequency range and 
used convex optimisation to select the antenna subset that 
maximises the downlink's Dirty-Paper Coding (DPC) 
capacity. The authors of the paper assumed that perfect CSI 
was available at the transmitter. A third method for selecting 
an optimal antenna is based on a binary searching algorithm 
using the maximising energy criterion [6]. The authors aimed 
to ensure energy efficiency in the m-MIMO system and 
assumed there was imperfect channel estimation at the 
transmitter. 
An algorithm that selects antennas with the highest channel 
gain in m-MIMO has also been proposed [7]. The selected 
antennas are combined with Non-Orthogonal Multiple 
Access (NOMA) to achieve high spectral efficiency in the 5G 
communication network. Antenna selection at the receiver 
side has also been studied [8]. In this paper, upper channel 
capacity bounds were statistically derived for both the Sub-
Array Switching (SAS) and Full-Array Switching (FAS) 
systems in the large-scale limit. The authors assumed that the 
CSI was only available on the receiver side. 
Several of these solutions are fast and optimal. However, 
most of the solutions that have been proposed in the literature, 
including those cited above, assume that the channel is 
perfectly known when selecting antennas. This is impossible 
in practice, especially when m-MIMO suffers from pilot 
contamination. 
Motivated by these observations, we previously proposed 
an 
antenna 
selection 
method 
that 
considers 
pilot 
contamination issue [10]. For this purpose, we presented a 
water-filling algorithm combined with Low-Density Parity-
Check (LDPC) to find the optimal subset of the antennas that 
maximised the ergodic capacity [10]. In this method, an 
LDPC decoder retrieves the received symbols. The recovered

message was then used to estimate the gain 𝐻. The estimated 
channel was employed to select the optimal subset of 
antennas that satisfied the maximum capacity criterion. For 
more details about the channel estimation method, we refer 
the readers to our previous work [9] 
This paper aims to enhance the performance of our 
previously published method [10] The Raptor codes are the 
most reliable among the erasure code, therefore, we include 
them instead of LDPC codes [10].  For more details about 
these codes, we refer the readers to [11] [12] [13] [14]. We, 
furthermore, add theoretical analysis to demonstrate how the 
water filling and the Raptor code will judiciously be exploited 
to select a performant subset of the antennas. 
The proposed solution exploits the physical layer features 
and does not add more chain elements. In addition, the 
method based on Raptor decoded symbols requires less 
transmit power and avoids overload in the network since the 
symbol pilot are not sent. Furthermore, the Lagrangian and 
the Water filling algorithm do not require an exhaustive 
search, making them less complex. Consequently, the 
proposed 
solution 
contributes 
to 
reducing 
energy 
consumption and processing resources. 
At the beginning of the process, when the decoded 
symbols are not yet available, we assume that the estimated 
channel is equal to one (that is, 𝐻̂ = 1); moreover, no subset 
is selected.  
This document is organised as follows: Section II presents 
the system models. Section III presents the simulation results, 
and Section IV concludes the paper. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
We consider  m-MIMO system with a total of 𝑁𝑡 transmit 
antennas and 𝑁𝑟  receive antennas, 𝑁𝑟 ≥ 𝑁𝑡 . For each 
transmission period, a set of 𝐿𝑟 < 𝑁𝑟  receive antennas is 
chosen for signal reception. Here, we consider the case where 
𝐿𝑟 > 𝑁𝑡  to ensure spatial multiplexing. If 𝐿𝑟 < 𝑁𝑡 , the 
system will be rank-deficient [15]. The channel gains form 
the channel matrix 𝑯 = [ℎ𝑖𝑗] ∈ ℂ𝑁𝑟×𝑁𝑡 , where ℎ𝑖𝑗 ∼
𝒞𝒩(0,1) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). 
Moreover, 𝑯  is known to the transmitter but not to the 
receiver. 𝑁𝑡 Raptor-encoded symbols are sent through the 
channel, and the received signal is given by: 
 
 
𝑌 = 𝐻𝑋 + 𝑁 
(1) 
 
𝑿 contains the elements 𝑥𝑖,are the transmitted signals from 
antenna 𝑖 . 𝒀 contains the entries 𝑦𝑗 , which represent the 
received signals of the 𝑗𝑡ℎ antenna where  𝑗 = 1, . . . , 𝑁𝑟.  
The water-filling algorithm was used to find the optimal 
subset of the antennas that maximized the ergodic capacity 
[15]. Moreover, we used  Raptor-decoded 
symbols 
to 
estimate the channel [9]. 
Gaussian noise vector 𝑵 ∈ 𝐶𝑁𝑟 consists of i.i.d. 𝐶𝑁(0, 𝑁0) 
variables so that 𝐸[𝑵𝑵†] = 𝜎𝑛
2𝐼𝑁𝑟 . 
The receiver uses the belief propagation algorithm to 
retrieve the transmitted message with a soft decoding process. 
The likelihood ratio of the channel for each coded bit are 
expressed as follows [7]: 
 
 
𝑍0 =
2𝐻̂
𝜎𝑛2 𝑌 
(2) 
 
The details for Raptor encoding and decoding are provided 
in a previous study [7]. 
𝐻̂ is the estimated random variable coefficients of 𝐻. The 
channel estimation is calculated using the Minimum Mean 
Squared Error (MMSE) as previously described [11] [13]. 
The 𝐻̂ channel is given by: 
 
 
𝐻̂ = 𝑅𝐻𝐻(𝑅𝐻𝐻𝑋𝑋𝑇 + 𝜎𝑛
2𝐼)−1𝑋𝑇𝑌 
(3) 
 
where 𝑅𝐻𝐻 is the covariance of 𝐻. 
To avoid symbol pilot contamination, the Raptor-decoded 
symbols 𝑆 ̂ are used instead of the pilot symbols X to 
estimate. 
the channel, as previously described [9]. Hence, X is 
substituted with 𝑆̂ in (3) as follows: 
 
 
𝐻̂ = 𝑅𝐻𝐻(𝑅𝐻𝐻𝑆𝑆𝑇 + 𝜎𝑛
2𝐼)−1𝑆𝑇𝑌 
(4) 
 
However, to perfectly estimate 𝐻  at the receiver, the 
average Bit Error Rate (BER) must approach zero, which 
means that the message must be entirely recovered (i.e., 𝑆 =
𝑋); otherwise, the system is in an outage and 𝐻 cannot be 
estimated. 
Corresponding to this outage probability, there is a 
minimum received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (𝑆𝑁𝑅), 𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛,  
given by: 
 
 
𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑝(𝑆𝑁𝑅 < 𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛) 
(5) 
 
𝐵𝐸𝑅 = 1
2 𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑐√𝑆𝑁𝑅 
 
𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 1
2 𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑐√𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛 
 
𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∝
1
𝑆𝑁𝑅 
 
𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑝(𝐵𝐸𝑅 > 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥) 
 
When 𝑆𝑁𝑅 ≥ 𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛 , the outage probability at the 
receiver reaches zero: 𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡 → 0  and 𝐵𝐸𝑅 → 0 .Under the 
fading, the channel is varying slowly. The capacity of the 
channel C can therefore be expressed as the maximum of 
mutual information using the following equation: 
 
 
𝐶 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + 𝑆𝑁𝑅)

Because =
𝐻̂𝐻̂𝑇
𝜎𝑛2  , (6) can be rewritten as: 
 
 
𝐶 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡 (𝐼 +
𝐻̂𝐻̂𝑇
𝜎𝑛2 ) 
(7) 
A. Antenna Selection 
As discussed in the previous section, no symbols are 
recovered when 𝑆𝑁𝑅 = 𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛  the system is in an outage. 
In this case, the estimated channel cannot be processed using 
our approach  .Therefore, our antenna selection method will 
not be applied since it is based on maximizing the capacity 
criterion. 
However, when the BER at the receiver approaches zero, 
𝐻̂  can be calculated. Antenna selection can then be 
performed to find the optimal antenna subset.  
As in a previous study [15], a diagonal matrix Δ of size 
𝑁𝑟 × 𝑁𝑟 is defined as follows: 
T𝑟(Δ) = ∑
∆𝑖= 𝐿𝑟 ≤ 𝑁𝑟
𝑁𝑟
𝑖
 represents the number of receive 
antennas selected at the reception. The received signal is re-
written, including receive antenna selection, as: 
 
 
𝑌 = ∆𝐻𝑋 + 𝑁 
(8) 
The ergodic capacity function of selected antennas can be 
written through the matrix Δ as follows: 
 
 
𝐶 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + ∆𝐻̂𝐻̂𝐻) 
(9) 
 
The optimization problem is to pick the 𝐿𝑟  receive 
antennas such that the capacity in (9) is maximized. It is 
equivalent to finding the matrix Δ such that: 
 
 
𝐶(∆) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑎𝑥
∆𝑖 ∈{0,1}
∑ ∆𝑖
𝑖
=𝐿𝑟
𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + ∆𝐻̂𝐻̂𝐻) 
(10) 
The antenna selection problem in the massive antenna 
system can be expressed as: 
 
 
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒
{∆}
𝐶(∆) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + ∆𝐻̂𝐻̂𝐻) 
(11) 
 
subject to: 
 
0 ≤ ∆≤ 1 → (𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 1) 
(12) 
 
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒(∆) = 𝐿𝑟  → (𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2) 
 
However, the term 𝐻̂𝐻̂𝐻 introduces a complexity on the 
order of 𝑜(𝑛6). This complexity can be reduced using the 
low-rank approximation method. The key point is to use the 
Single Value Decomposition (SVD) method to achieve an 
ideal low-level estimator.  
According to the signal processing theory, the channel 
correlation matrix can be decomposed using SVD of low-
rank approximation, as previously described [16]: 
 
 
𝑅𝐻𝐻 = 𝑈 ∧ 𝑈𝐻 
(13) 
 
U is a unitary matrix and ∧ is a diagonal matrix with the 
singular values of 𝑅𝐻𝐻. The MMSE equation can therefore be 
represented by: 
 
 
𝑠𝑣𝑑(𝐻̂) = 𝑈 ∧ 𝑈𝐻(𝑈 ∧ 𝑈𝐻𝑆𝑆𝑇 + 𝜎𝑛
2)−1𝑆𝑌 
(14) 
 
If taking Σ =∧ (𝑈 ∧ 𝑈𝐻𝑃 + σn
2)−1, the eigenvalue of ∧ is 
𝜆1 ≥ 𝜆2 ≥ ⋯ 𝜆𝑛 ≥ 0 non-zero. 
 
 
𝛴 =
𝜆𝑘𝑆𝑌
𝜆𝑘𝑆𝑆𝑇+𝜎𝑛2  
(15) 
 
Only the diagonal value is considered in the low rank, so Σ 
could be written by: 
∆𝑃= {
𝜆𝑘𝑆𝑌
𝜆𝑘𝑆𝑆𝑇+𝜎𝑛2   𝑖𝑓 𝑘 =  0;  1;… … … . . 𝑃 − 1;
0                           𝑖𝑓 𝑘 =  𝑃; 𝑃 +  1; … … … . . 𝑁 − 1;
 
(16) 
Then finally, the SVD algorithm can be represented as 
previously described [8]: 
 
 
𝛴 = [𝛥𝑃

(17) 
 
 
𝛥𝑃 =

(20) 
 
The simplification term in the denominator can be written 
as: 
 
 
(𝑆𝑆𝑇𝜆0 + 𝜎𝑛
2)2 = 𝜆0𝑆𝑇𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑇 + (𝜎𝑛

(21) 
Hence,

In high Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR), the equation (22) 
can be rewritten as follows: 
 
 
𝛥𝑃
2 = 𝜆𝑘
𝑌𝑌𝑇
𝑆𝑆𝑇  
(23) 
 
𝛥𝑃
2 = ∑
𝜆𝑘 (

(24) 
And the equation (11) becomes:  
 
𝐶(∆) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑎𝑥
∆𝑖 
∑ ∆𝑖

𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + ∆(𝑈𝛥𝑃

Because 𝑈∆𝑈𝐻 = Π, 
 
 
𝐶(∆) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + 𝛥𝑃𝛱𝛥𝑃) 
(26) 
 
The objective function is concave in Π. However, the Π 
are binary integer variables making the optimization problem 
hard for Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP). In time 
order to solve this optimization problem, as in a previous 
study [17], we relax the constraint that each Π must be a 
binary integer to the weaker constraint that: 
 
 
0 ≤ Π ≤ 1  
(27) 
The original problem thus becomes a convex optimization 
problem solvable with water-filling. The Lagrangian method 
is used to optimize the power of the selected received 
antennas 𝐿𝑟.  
Let 𝑓(Π) = log2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼 + Δ𝑃ΠΔ𝑃) and (Π) = 𝑡𝑟(Π) − 𝐿𝑟. 
The Lagrangian equation is given as follows: 
 
ℒ(Π, 𝜓) = Δ𝑃ΠΔ𝑃 − 𝜓(𝑡𝑟(Π) − 𝐿𝑟)  
(28) 
The derived form of equation (25) is given bellow: 
 
𝜕ℒ(Π,𝜓)
𝜕Π

Δ𝑃Δ𝑃
(𝐼+Δ𝑃ΠΔ𝑃) −  𝜓 = 0 ⇒

𝐻 ⇒ Π = 𝜓−1 − Δ𝑃
−2 (29) 
 
𝜕ℒ(Π, 𝜓)
𝜕𝜓

From (27) at optimality, Π is diagonal. Then the following 
water filling solution can be obtained 
 
 
Π = (𝜓−1 − Δ𝑃

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The performance of our scheme is evaluated. The 
codeword length chosen for LDPC encoding is 80000 bits, 
the message length is 980 bits, and the code rate is 0.98. The  
degree of distribution of the Luby Transform (LT)  encoding 
is the same as that used in [18]and is as follows: 
Figure1.  Ergodic capacity vs. SNR 
 
𝛺(𝑥) = 0.008𝑥 + 049𝑥2 + 0.166𝑥3 + 0.073𝑥4 +
0.083𝑥5 + 0.056𝑥8 + 0.037𝑥9 + 0.056𝑥19 + 0.025𝑥65 +
0.003𝑥66.  urrteermore, we rse a massiee-MIMO system 
ineoleing 16 antennas at receieer and eiget antennas at tee 
transmitter and a srbset of tee selected antennas Lr=12.  
Figure 1 shows the relationship between ergodic capacity 
and received SNR. The ergodic capacity allows us to select 
the optimal number of antennas. In this part, the simulation is 
performed to evaluate four scenarios: 
1) Scenario 1: represents our proposed method under 
perfect CSI and without performing antenna selection 
method (shown in black with an asterisk) 
2) Scenario 2: depicts our proposed method all antennas 
are selected, and CSI is estimated using the Raptor decoded 
symbols (blue with circular markers) 
3) Scenario 3: describes an exhaustive method (used in 
conventional MiMo), the number of selected antennas Lr=12. 
CSI is estimated using the Raptor decoded symbols (red with 
a triangle pointing to the right) 
4) Scenario 4: illustrates our proposed method where 
Lr=12. CSI estimated using Raptor decoded symbols (black 
with a plus sign). 
Note that the graphs of the first and second scenarios are 
superposed because they meet the same ergodic capacity 
values regardless of SNRs’ values. This proves our 
approach's efficiency. However, the ergodic capacity of the 
two latest scenarios remains low when the SNR is between -
15dB and -5dB since the channel cannot be estimated in this 
interval (see section II-A).

The ergodic capacity approaches the values of the first two 
scenarios for an SNR>0. Since the message is completely 
recovered and the channel is correctly estimated. For the 
following simulations, we only consider the values when 
SNR>0. 
Figure 2. shows the ergodic capacity vs received SNR per 
selected antennas Lr, Lr=12, 10 and 8. The results show that 
Lr=12 achieves the near-to-optimal values. 
Figure 3 compares the results of the Raptor-based antenna 
optimizations and LDPC- based antenna optimizations 
method proposed in previous work [10]. The channel 
estimated with Raptor code attains higher optimal capacity 
than the channel estimated with LDPC code.   
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes an antenna selection method 
performed under imperfect CSI. Our solution combines an 
antenna selection method based on mutual information 
maximization and the Raptor decoded information symbols. 
The Raptor decoded message is used to estimate the channel, 
and then the water-filling algorithm uses the estimated 
channel to select the highest-performing subset of antennas. 
This method requires less transmit power and avoids 
overload in the network since the symbol pilot are not sent. 
Which contributes to reducing energy consumption and 
processing resources Simulation results show that the ergodic 
capacity reaches near to optimal values using Raptor code 
than LDPC. Future work can include other methods of 
antenna selection.
