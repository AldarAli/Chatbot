Abstract— Humans have always wanted to determine position 
in an unknown environment. At the beginning methods were 
simple. They were based on the observation of characteristic 
points, in the case of shipping additional observations of the 
coastline. Then came navigation based on astronomical 
methods (astronavigation). At the beginning of the XX-century 
a new way of determining the current location was developed. 
It has used radiowave signals. First came radio-beacons. Then 
ground-based systems came. Currently satellite systems are 
being used. At present, the most popular one is Global 
Positioning System (GPS). This system is fully controlled by 
the Department of Defense, and only the U.S. forces and their 
closest allies have been guaranteed accuracy offered by the 
system. Armies of other countries can only use the civilian 
version. This situation has engendered the need for an 
independent radiolocation system. This article describes the 
construction and operation of such a technology demonstrator 
that was developed at Gdansk University of Technology. It was 
named AEGIR (according to Norse mythology: god of the seas 
and oceans). The main advantage of the system is managing 
without the chain organization of the reference stations, which 
work now with each other asynchronously. This article 
demonstrates the functionality of such system.  It also presents 
results and analysis of its effectiveness.

 INTRODUCTION 
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is seen by 
terrorists or hostile countries as a high value target. Volpe 
Center report contains the following statement [1]: “During 
the course of its development for military use and more 
recent extension to many civilian uses, vulnerabilities of 
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) – in the United 
States the Global Positioning System (GPS) – have become 
apparent. The vulnerabilities arise from natural, intentional, 
and unintentional sources. Increasing civilian and military 
reliance on GNSS brings with it a vital need to identify the 
critical vulnerabilities to civilian users, and to develop a 
plan to mitigate these vulnerabilities.”. GNSS can also be 
targeted by more common criminals - computer hackers and 
virus writers. Therefore, there is a need for maintenance and 
continued development of independent radionavigation and 
radiolocation systems. 
Based on many years of experience in the field of 
modern radiocommunication systems in the Department of 
Radiocommunication Systems and Networks at Gdansk 
University of Technology, in cooperation with the OBR 
Marine Technology Centre in Gdynia and with the support 
of the Hydrographic Office of Polish Navy a ground-based 
radiolocation system, which was named AEGIR has been 
developed, built and tested in real environment. In this 
system, all reference stations are working in an 
asynchronous way, so each station uses a local generator to 
transmit a message location and can receive signals from 
neighboring stations. On the basis of the received signals 
reference station determines the time difference between its 
own rhythm of work, and the neighboring reference stations. 
The measurement results are periodically placed in the 
localization message. The receiver on the basis of self-
measurements and measurements from the reference 
stations estimates its location. Compared to existing 
solutions like Loran-C (Long Range Navigation - C) [2], the 
AEGIR system resigns chain relationship between reference 
stations. In the proposed system, there are no supervision  
centers for maintenance which reduces operating costs and 
increases system reliability. With this approach, our system 
has gained new features and new functionality compared to 
traditional solutions. 
This paper at the beginning will present basics of the 
TDOA  method. Then principle of asynchronous system 
will be described. The next section describes hardware 
implementation of the presented system. The last two 
describes investigation  results and a brief summary. 
II. 
HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS – TDOA METHOD 
As mentioned before, the AEGIR system is a ground 
based radiolocation system. Therefore a measurement 
method of Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) was chosen 
to estimate the position of a localizer. Suppose there are N 
ground stations, the coordinates for the i-th station are

If you define a signal propagation time between the i-th 
station and the searched position in the point M as Ti, so the 
distance between the i-th station and the point M is as 
follow:

Equation 4 presents the difference in distance between 
the first and i-th station. 
Determination of the distance difference between 
another pair of base stations generates more hyperbolas and 
a point of their intersection gives us a position. There are 
many algorithms [3-6], which allow to determine the 
coordinates. For the purpose of the system the Chan method 
was chosen [3], because it gives results without iterative 
calculations and additionally it is simple to implement. 
III. 
ASYNCHRONOUS SYSTEM 
As mentioned in the introduction, the AEGIR system is 
fully asynchronous. The principle of asynchronous method 
can be illustrated as follows. Assume that we have three 
reference stations positioned as in Fig. 1. 
Fig. 1. Deployment of ground stations to illustrate the method of 
TDOA  
Propagation time from the stations S1, S2 and S3 to 
desired position in the point M (localizer) is respectively T1, 
T2 and T3. Each station has coordinates as follows: S1=(xS1, 
yS1), S2=(xS2, yS2) and S3=(xS3, yS3). Stations transmit a 
reference signal, for simplicity, as an impulse, but time of 
broadcasting these impulses, as shown in Fig. 2a, is random. 
The stations have the ability to "listen to” neighboring 
stations. This is illustrated in Fig. 2b. Reference station 
designated as S1 receives signal from other two stations: S2 
and S3, and calculates the time difference between its own 
and these stations’ signals (nT21 and nT31). These time 
differences are then sent to the localizer. The localizer (at 
point M) (pictured in Fig. 2c) sets its own time difference 
between the received impulses from the reference station 
(dT21 and dT31). 
Additionally, each ground station sends to the localizer 
its own coordinates (respectively xS1, yS1 - the coordinates 
of the first station; xS2, yS2 - coordinates of the second 
station; xS3 and yS3 - coordinates of the third station), so that 
the localizer calculates the propagation time between the 
reference stations (TS1S2, TS1S3).  
Taking into account all sent data, the localizer (at point 
M) calculates a real difference in time propagation between 
stations, which present the following equation:

algorithms [3-6].

IV. 
HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION 
The AEGIR system has been built as a demonstrator of 
technology. The system consists of a localizer and three 
reference stations. 
The block diagram of a localizer is presented in Fig. 3. 
 
Fig. 3. Block diagram of a localizer. 
The localizer has been made in the technology of 
Software Defined Radio [7]. It consists of: an antenna, a 
broadband receiver, an analog to digital converter (in the 
form of data acquisition card) and a digital signal processor 
(in form of PC). This approach allows to shape flexibly 
functionality of the localizer. 
Ground stations, as it was mentioned before, have the 
ability to "listen to” neighboring stations. It is assumed that 
the system should consists only of such stations (Master 
ones). However, for demonstrable purposes only one Master 
station is required. Therefore, two types of ground stations 
were created: broadcasting stations (Slave type) and 
broadcasting and listening ones (Master type). 
The block diagram of a Slave station is shown in Fig 4. 
 
Fig. 4. Block diagram of a Slave station 
The main element of the station is a radio signal 
generator, whose task is to broadcast modulated signal with 
data that are generated by industrial computer.

The block diagram of the last element of the described 
system - Master station – is shown in Fig. 5. 
 
Fig. 5. Block diagram of a Master station 
Master station is a combination of a localizer and a 
Slave station. The task of the receiver is to listen to a nearby 
station and to determine difference in synchronization 
between reference signal and signals from the neighboring 
stations. To enable listening to neighboring stations, Master 
one has been equipped with a coupler and a SPDT switch, 
which periodically changes transmitting antenna into a 
receiving one.  
All 
devices 
are 
based 
on 
a 
universal 
radiocommunication 
equipment. 
The 
entire 
system 
functionality is provided by software installed on 
computers. 
V. 
RADIO PARAMETERS 
Analysing the bandwidth VHF / UHF (Very High 
Frequen-cy / Ultra High Frequency) among resources 
available for civil use, it was decided to build system using 
DS-CDMA technology (Direct Sequence Code Division 
Multiple Access) in the band 430 MHz, with the following 
parameters: 
• Carrier frequency 431.5 MHz system, 
• bandwidth of the transmission channel - 1 MHz (4 
MHz) 
• Sampling frequency baseband signal - 4 MHz (16 
MHz), 
• the location information transmission rate - 1 kb / s, 
• QPSK modulation (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying). 
VI. 
TESTS AND RESULTS 
At the moment there were 4 large test sessions carried 
out in real conditions. Two sessions were carried out in 
2010, in April and October. Then next two in 2011, in June 
and October. The last test was performed on board a survey 
ship of the Polish Navy. 
The AEGIR system has been tested three times in the 
Bay of Gdańsk and once - along the coast line of the Baltic 
Sea. During field tests a position from a satellite navigation 
system was recorded with the use of a Javad Alpha receiver, 
which enables simultaneous reception from both American 
(GPS) and Russian (GLONASS) systems. During the test 
performed on board of the Navy vessel, two geodetic DGPS 
receivers have been used (Leica VIVA GS15). They have 
been installed along the axis of the vessel and the AEGIR 
antenna has been placed between them. 
The effects of our tests performed in October 2010 are 
illustrated by the visualization shown in Fig. 6, created with 
use of Google Earth software. The dotted line represents the 
path of positions received from the satellite systems 
GPS/GLONASS, and the dots represent the calculated 
positions of the ground-based system.

GLONASS positions (dotted line) and readings of autonomous AEGIR 
system (dots) 
Analyzing the visualization shown in Fig. 6 it can be 
observed how accurate the route travelled by the vessel was 
reconstructed by points calculated by the autonomous 
localization system – AEGIR. 
After completing the measurements, average error 
(relative to the position shown by the GPS / GLONASS) 
was obtained at 46m. Distribution and histogram of all 
results are illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

Fig. 7. Histogram of results. 
 
Fig. 8. Distribution of  results. 
Analyzing the distribution function in Fig. 8 it can be 
observe, that in 90% of all measured cases the difference 
distance is bellow 100m. 
Test performed in June 2011 was carried out in different 
configuration. Ground stations were set in a less favorable 
configuration, along the coastline. Additionally a bandwidth 
was increased up to 4MHz. It was expected, that because of 
the unfavorable ground station placement results may 
worsen comparing to previous ones. However a wider 
bandwidth would compensate for poor geometry of the 
system. 
Visualization of this configuration is illustrated in Fig. 9.  
 
Fig. 9. Visualisation of AEGIR path when ground station are placed along 
the shore. 
As before an average error has been calculated and 
obtained at 55m. So as predicted increase of bandwidth 
nearly compensated a poor system geometry. 
Distribution and histogram of obtained results are 
illustrated in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.

The last test has been carried out in October 2011 with 
the support of the Hydrographic Office of Polish Navy. The 
system was tested again in the Bay of Gdansk with the same 
radio parameters as before. Visualization of travelled route 
illustrates Fig. 12.

The main objective of the tests was the comparison of 
the results obtained with the use of bandwidth 1MHz and 
4MHz. In addition, the correctness of the system was 
verified in case of location placed outside the geometry of 
the system (the triangle designated by the reference ground 
stations). It was expected the coordinates estimated outside 
the area of good geometry will worsen (outside of the 
triangle). Figure 13 presents shift of the estimated position 
outside of the mentioned area.

As before an average error has been calculated and 
obtained at 30m. It should be emphasized that this result 
also contains the results which have been measured outside 
the good geometry of the system (outside the triangle). 
Distribution of the results is illustrated in Fig. 14.

Analyzing the distribution function in Fig. 14 it can be 
observed, that in 90% of all measured cases the difference 
distance is bellow 60m. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The AEGIR system is a contribution to the development 
of ground radiolocation systems. The use of modern 
technology (developed system is fully digital) guarantees 
the long term operating of such a system. 
An important advantage of the developed system is that 
in the process of estimating the position of the locator 
coordinates are determined directly (without the need to 
assign these coordinates to the so-called line items that are  
needed in phase systems). Therefore, there is no need for 
start position locator and counting the excess line items that 
are repeated periodically in the area of the system, 
depending on the wavelength of the radio and that can lead 
to errors in the upright-commercial determination of the 
geographical coordinates of the locator. 
The presented system is fully asynchronous. In case of 
damage or shutdown of one of the stations, the system is 
fully functional, the only condition is to receive signals from 
at least three ground stations. 
The AEGIR system has been developed to be very 
flexible. It allows to use more than three ground-stations. 
Placing them in areas of known positions, allows to create a 
grid, which will provide an readings of coordinates 
independent from satellite systems. Using more than three 
reference station will also increase precision of calculating 
position. 
The AEGIR works in both kind of ground station 
configuration (triangle deployment and along coastline as 
well).

In the course of designing and building the system, the 
adequacy of the system for water bodies has been focused 
on. However, the versatility of the proposed solution 
suggests that the system would work on land as well.
