Abstract—The implementation of e-health solutions targeting 
patients and citizens as users is an important aspect of national 
policies 
of 
development 
of 
information 
technology 
infrastructure in health care in Poland. The success of these 
plans is related not only to political decisions but also to the 
response of potential users. The main objective of the study 
was the comparison of the level of acceptance of the use of 
e-health solutions for accomplishment of specific activities 
demonstrated by physicians and patients with chronic diseases. 
The analysis presented in the paper was based on the results of 
two surveys dedicated to the assessment of the views of medical 
personnel and patients on the importance of e-health in Polish 
health care system. The survey for physicians was performed 
among participants of speciality trainings in the period from 
November 2011 to December 2012 in Krakow, Poland. The 
survey for patients was carried out among the patients 
diagnosed with chronic disease who were hospitalized or 
attended ambulatory visit at three health care centers in 
Krakow, Poland in the period from mid-December 2011 to 
mid-February 2012. From 200 questionnaires distributed to 
physicians, 
186 
were 
returned 
by 
respondents. 
The 
questionnaires for patients were filled by 207 respondents from 
230 who were approached. The level of acceptance for specific 
e-health applications was higher among physicians. The 
differences were statistically significant in case of all but one 
application. Interestingly, the applications with highest 
acceptance in both groups of respondents included online 
appointment with physician, access to the results of laboratory 
tests and access to educational resources. In conclusion, it 
should be stated that physicians reveal significantly higher 
acceptance of e-health use, but the perception of priorities 
among specific e-health applications is convergent between 
physicians and patients.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Chronic care remains one of the greatest challenges for 
modern health care systems. Patients suffering from chronic 
disorders require support on long-term basis. There are 
estimations which indicate that even 40% of citizens living 
in modern societies are afflicted with chronic medical 
conditions [1]. Furthermore, the budgets used for support of 
chronic patients reveal growing trends [2]. 
As close cooperation and communication between 
patients and physicians are prerequisites of efficient care, 
both groups of users should be ready to use proposed 
e-health solutions. The use of such solutions may enhance 
repetitive interactions between patients and providers. 
Nowadays, it is also obvious that patients should be involved 
in activities related to controlling and treating of disease 
[3,4]. All these circumstances result in search for more 
efficient models of care which could be offered to patients 
with chronic disorders [5-8].  
The main objective of the study was the comparison of 
the level of acceptance of the use of e-health solutions for 
accomplishment of specific activities demonstrated by 
physicians and patients with chronic diseases. 
The paper consists of five sections. The Introduction 
section indicates rationale and objective for the study. In the 
Methods section the methodology of the surveys carried out 
among patients and physicians is described. The Results 
section brings the characteristics of both respondents’ groups 
as well as results of comparison of acceptance of specific 
e-health applications between them. In the Discussion 
section, short discussion about significance of results is 
provided. In the final section, the conclusion summarizing 
obtained results is given. Furthermore, the plans for future 
research are revealed. 
II. 
METHODS  
The comparison of the acceptance of specific e-health 
applications among patients and physicians was carried out 
on data obtained from surveys targeting both groups.  
The survey designed for physicians was focused on the 
general use of computers and Internet, the perception of 
importance and circumstances of e-health in modern health 
care, and finally, the acceptance for performance of specific 
health care services in e-health environment. In total, 30 
items were included in the questionnaire. The methodology 
of the survey performed among physicians was described in 
detail elsewhere [9]. 
The survey realized among patients covered the issues 
related to coping with chronic condition, general issues of 
computer and Internet literacy, the use of information 
technology (IT) for health-related activities, the perception of 
e-health feasibility for support of health care and finally, the 
acceptance of specific functionalities delivered with e-health 
applications. Further details on the patients survey may be

found in an earlier published paper [10], focusing 
exclusively on patients with chronic respiratory diseases.  
The items targeting the assessment of the acceptance of 
concrete e-health applications were compatible both in term 
of the set of enlisted applications and response scale. Both 
questionnaires included predominantly closed questions. The 
responses to the items focused on the opinions of the 
respondents were based on 5-point Likert scale with neutral 
option in the middle (from ‘decidedly yes’ to ‘decidedly 
no’).   
The survey for physicians was performed among 
participants of the courses on public health obligatory to 
participants of all specialities training and organized by 
Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education, Jagiellonian 
University, in Krakow, from November 2011 to December 
2012. The survey for patients was carried out among the 
patients diagnosed with chronic disease who were 
hospitalized or attended ambulatory visit at three health care 
centers in Krakow, Poland in the period from mid-December 
2011 to mid-February 2012. Only patients with established 
diagnosis of chronic disease were recruited to the survey. 
Patients, who were hospitalized or admitted to polyclinics for 
diagnosis of new symptoms, were not included in the study, 
unless they had previously been diagnosed with a chronic 
disease. 
Both surveys were assessed by Bioethical Committee at 
Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland (decision No 
KBET/226/B/2011 dated October, 27, 2011 for physicians’ 
survey and decision No KBET/107/B/2011 dated June 30, 
2011 for patients’ survey). The questionnaires were filled by 
physicians anonymously. The patients were asked to fill 
informed consent form. The respondents were informed 
before the survey that they can withdraw from the study in 
any moment.  
Statistical analysis was carried out with Statistica v.10 Pl 
(StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK, USA) [11]. The descriptive 
analysis was performed for the variables included in this 
paper. If not stated otherwise, the frequency of a given 
response to a specific item was given as a percentage of all 
valid responses excluding missing responses. The level of 
acceptance was assessed with 5-point Likert scale. Definite 
negative option of response was assigned with value of 1, 
and the most positive opinion with value of 5. The 
differences in the acceptance level for specific e-health 
applications were assessed with non-parametric test for 
independent samples (Mann-Whitney U test).

RESULTS 
A. Physicians 
Characteristics of respondents   
Questionnaires were distributed to 200 respondents; 
filled ones were returned by 186 of them. Five questionnaires 
were excluded from further analysis due to considerable 
deficiencies of responses. Women made 65.7% (n=119) of 
the group of respondents. The mean age of physician who 
filled the questionnaires was 34.9 (SD=6.4) years, 
34.7(SD=6.7) among women and 35.5 (SD=5.9) among 
men. 
There were 29.8% (n=54) of respondents with speciality 
certificate in internal medicine, 5.5% (n=10) in surgery, 
3.9% (n=7) in anesthesiology, 10.5% (n=19) in pediatrics, 
2.2% (n=4) in gynecology, and 3.9% (n=7) in family 
medicine. Other specialities were declared by 27.1% (n=49), 
and none by 20.4% (n=37) of them. As many as 75.7% 
(n=137) of respondents were employed in hospitals with at 
least 200 beds, 6.1% (n=11) in hospitals with 100-200 beds, 
and 7.2% (n=13) in hospitals <100 beds. Furthermore, 33.1% 
(n=60) of them worked in polyclinics, and 15.5% (n=28) in 
private practices. 
The use of Internet was confirmed by all participants of 
the survey (n=181). Among respondents, 2.2% (n=4) used 
Internet not longer than for 2 years, 7.8% (n=14) for above 2 
to 5 years, 30.2% (n=54) for above 5 to 10 years, and 59.8% 
(n=107) for more than 10 years. Every day use of Internet 
was declared by 82.3% (n=148) respondents; several times a 
week but not every day by 16.2% (n=29), and only once a 
week by 1.1% (n=2). The use of Internet at home was 
indicated by 96.1% (n=174) of physicians and at work site 
by 88.4% (n=160). Wireless access to Internet was utilized 
by 27.1% (n=49) respondents. Detailed characteristics of the 
physicians who participated in the survey was covered 
elsewhere [9].

respondents, in the work place or at school by 49.6% (n=59), 
in friends by 6.7% (n=8) and in Internet café by 1.7% (n=2).  
The acceptance of specific e-health applications 
potentially feasible for patients with chronic diseases  
The structure of responses on acceptability of specific 
e-health applications among patients participating in the 
survey were shown in the Table III. Patients revealed the 
highest acceptance (mean, SD) for e-health applications 
enabling appointments to physician’s office (3.77, SD=0.57), 
access to educational resources (3.57, 0.66), access to the 
results of laboratory tests (3.56, SD=0.67) and renewal of 
prescriptions (3.49, SD=1.03). The acceptance for the 
teleconsultation with physician was the lowest from all 
potential solutions (3.20, SD=1.23).

C. The comparision of the acceptance of e-health 
applications between physicians and patients  
The comparison of the acceptance of specific e-health 
applications feasible for patients with chronic diseases 
between physician and patients revealed uniformly higher 
level of acceptance among physicians. The differences in the 
level of acceptance were significantly higher for all but one 
application (teleconsultation with physician). The details of 
the analysis were shown in Table IV.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The surveys performed in the group of physicians 
participating in the speciality courses and in the group of 
patients with chronic conditions revealed significant 
differences in the level of acceptance between these two 
groups. Physicians demonstrated higher acceptance for 
specific application than patients and most differences were 
statistically significant.  
It should be noted that the differences could be attributed 
not only to perception of e-health feasibility among both 
groups of respondents but also to the fact that the mean age 
of physicians was lower than of patients.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Despite significant differences in the acceptance levels 
for specific applications between physicians and patients, the 
e-health applications which were top-ranked by both groups 
included making appointments with physician, access to the 
results of laboratory tests and access to educational resources 
profiled for patients. The author plans to proceed with 
assessment of the acceptance of e-health solutions by other 
patients and health professionals groups as well as 
identification of barriers for e-health growth in Poland.
