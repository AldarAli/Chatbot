Abstract—The paper deals with in-vehicle communication 
networks and the use of emerging Power Line Technology 
(PLC) for infotainment application. It appears that with the 
increase of Electronic Devices Unit (ECU) both for real time 
application and infotainment, there is a wire harness 
bottleneck. So, PLC seems to be a promising in-vehicle 
network for high data rates applications.After reviewing 
possible 
issues, 
in-vehicle 
PLC 
channels 
and 
noise 
measurements are presented. We discuss the Physical Layer  
(PHY layer) PLC system parameters based on these 
measurements. 
Finally, 
an 
embedded 
demonstrator 
is 
proposed in order to improve them in a real in-vehicle channel 
environment.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
As the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in vehicles has 
experienced an exponential demand in the last decades 
[1][2], the automotive industry has introduced dedicated 
buses as the Control Area Network (CAN) [5], Local 
Interconnect Network (LIN) [7],Flexray and Media Oriented 
Systems Transport(MOST) [7]. CAN and FlexRay have been 
designed for real-time delivery of messages. However, they 
do not support high data-rate applications.MOST is used for 
infotainment applications, and provides a bandwidth of about 
50 Mbps. The last version increases the bandwidth up to 150 
Mbps and offers a physical layer to implement Ethernet in 
vehicles. It supports both optical and electrical layers. It 
allows up to 15 stereo audio channels or MPEG1 
channels.Although these networks reduce the amount of 
wires, they use specific wires and specific protocols. 
However, the use of the power distribution channels inside 
vehicles both for power and communication purposes is a 
promising alternative. It would answer the vehicle 
requirements namely, cost, decrease of the amount of wires 
and weight, and offer more flexibility to introduce new 
applications. 
 
Taking into account both the In-Vehicle Infotainment 
(IVI) and X-by-wire (X means any mechanical system) 
requirements, we can observe the necessity to find a limited 
set of networks which answer to the growing of the multiple 
applications. These new networks may be able to 
dynamically optimize their parameters according to the 
loads on the network (that means active ECUs), the data rate 
needs (bandwidth sharing) and the state of the vehicle 
(motor 
ON/OFF, 
vehicle 
in 
motion, 
speed), 
etc. 
Furthermore, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)and Vehicle to 
Infrastructure (V2X)are currently in active development by 
automakers like the well-known BMW, Audi, and Volvo 
[19]. One idea is to propose a new communication protocol 
which will be compliant both for in vehicle requirements 
and V2X applications. Among alternatives to existing on-
board networks, PLC seems attractive. Many studies are 
carried out on PLC and focus both on channels and noise in 
order to optimize the PHY layer and the MAC layer 
[3].Commercial solutions based on PLC for CAN are 
provided by Yamar Electronics Ltd. Their PLC-based 
product families provide maximal data rates of 1.3 Mbps 
and carrier frequencies in the 1.75 to 13 MHz range. 
However, they are not yet introduced in vehicles. The 
current PLC solutions presented by Ferreira et al. [3] show it 
is possible to achieve data rate more than 50 Mbps, which is 
consistent with video or audio applications. PLC can be 
applied also to critical control application. However, the 
automakers are still reluctant about the transformation of the 
well known protocols by this PLC solution.Currently, the 
infotainment area seems to be more open for PLC. In fact, 
more and more vehicles offer IVI systems and driving 
technologies, through MOST or wireless connection. The 
disadvantages of these solutions are the lack of flexibility 
and the necessary compatibility of devices.One idea is to be 
able to plug and play any devices offering anTransport 
Control 
Protocol/ 
Internet 
Protocol 
(TCP/IP)access, 
anywhere in the passenger cell of the vehicle. In indoor 
application, PLC is already used for multimedia application. 
Latchman et al. [4], the authors provide an overview of the 
development of the MAC and PHY layers. Repeating 
functions have been introduced to achieve higher data rate 
while using frequency bands above 30 MHz.PLC modems 
may answer theses new challenges, while maintaining 
bandwidth, data rate and multiplexing flexibility.  
In order to introduce PLC in cars, it is necessary to know 
the channels and the possible scenarios. Section 2 will 
review previous vehicle networks studies, and focus on PLC. 
In order to propose PLC solution, it is necessary to study in-
vehicle Direct Current (DC) channels to extract the main 
parameters for the PHY and MAC layers. Section 3 
provides a description of the experimentations under in-

vehicle DC electrical wires and the main results. Taking into 
account those in-vehicle measurements, the channel 
characteristics will allow us to define the best parameters for 
the signal processing and communication system, like the 
bandwidth, the modulation, the equalization. The practical 
approach is discussed in Section 4. In the next step, it seems 
to be interesting to test several algorithms under real 
channel while keeping algorithms flexibility. That is why 
we propose to study a fast prototypingsolution to perform 
this task using Software Defined Radio(SDR)principle. In 
this case, the PHY layer is developed in software thanks to 
Matlab or Labview tools. We used the flexible SDR 
platform USRP2 [17][18]developed by ETTUS and actually 
commercialized 
by 
National 
Instrument 
(NI). 
This 
demonstrator is presented in Section 5. Finally, we will 
conclude the paper in the last section. 
II. 
COMMUNICATION NETWORKS FOR VEHICLES 
First of all, the introduction of communication networks 
was due to that the use of point-to-point communication 
links was not scalable with the increasing number of 
electronic 
components. 
The 
demand 
for 
efficient 
networking, including requirements on providing the 
physical medium (i.e., wires) for communication, has only 
increased with modern cars being high technology 
mechatronical systems. This is the main incentive for 
considering automotive PLC. The Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE) [20] defines four classes (A to D) of 
automotive communication networks based on transmission 
speed and applications. The two first classes use low-speed 
event triggered protocols for low data rate. High-speed real-
time communication in Class C and Class D networks relies 
on 
high-speed 
event 
and 
time-triggered 
protocols, 
respectively.The latter are used for multimedia data, such as 
audio/video streaming, video games or cameras monitoring, 
and safety critical applications, such as, e.g., X-by-wire 
systems, which impose high requirements on availability of 
resources and reliability of communications. 
If we consider these two classes and the reduction of the 
number of wires, technology originally developed for in-
home PLC, namely HomePlug AV, and HD-PLC, seem to 
be attractive. During the last decades, many studies have 
been carried out on direct current (12/42 V) voltage for 
embedded application in vehicles (cars, aircraft) like in 
[5][6][7]. The results are very promising in that data rates of 
up to 10 Mbps could be achieved using an approximately 30 
MHz bandwidth.Since the medium access control (MAC) 
protocol is based on the hybrid time-division multiple 
access (TDMA) and CSMA/CA of HomePlug AV and HD-
PLC, it could support both class C and D networks. 
Furthermore, Electric Vehicles (EV) may be considered. 
PLC 
in 
EVs 
has 
been 
studiedby 
Bassi 
et 
al. 
[14].Experiments of Guerrieni et al. [16] using commercial 
modems from Yamar [16] for PLC in an EV demonstrate 
reliable communication with data rates of about 1 
Mbps.PLC has also been considered for communication 
between the EV and the charging infrastructure. The IEC 
61851 standard defines two charging modes, which require 
a control pilot signal. Both narrowband and broadband PLC 
solutions have been proposed for EV to electric vehicle 
service equipment communication, e.g.,in SAE J2931/2-4 
[21]. Recently, the ISO/IEC 15118-3 standard adopts the 
broadband HomePlug Green PHY as the mandatory 
PHY/MAC layer technology. The narrowband G3-PLC 
(ITU-T G.9955) is specified as an optional mode [8]. 
Among the other solutions for high data rates, we can 
mention the optical fiber transmission and optical wireless 
communication.Considering the fiber, this solution has been 
chosen for the MOST protocol using plastic fiber, from 25 
Mbps up to 1 Gbps. The MOST technology is 
alsoconsidered to be the transmission support for the 
advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). One 
attractive solution is to propose a new modulation scheme 
like multi-carriers over this channel. A simple single carrier 
modulation is used but does not exploit all the bandwidth 
offered by the fiber.On the other hand, Visible Light 
Communication (VLC) technologycan be used as a medium 
for data transmission, both for in-vehicle and V2X 
communication, while achieving high data rates as 
compared to conventional wireless technologies like for 
example Wi-Fi or Wimax. In the early 2000s, researches 
started using visible light from LEDs as the medium for 
communication. VLC communication can achieve about 
800Mbps data rate for short range communications. 
Researchconductedby Deok-Rae Kim et al. [9] demonstrates 
the possibility of combining VLC and CAN protocol. 
Furthermore, we can notice the studies on using Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) techniques over 
these two channels [10]. On restriction of VLC solution is 
the need to have light and preferred line of sight.We will 
now discuss about the in-vehicle power lines. 
III. 
CHANNEL MEASUREMENTS 
Characterization of PLC channels has been reported 
according to two major scenarios on four vehicles: front to 
rear, front to front. These configurations represent possible 
scenarios for infotainment applications. The measurement 
setup is presented in detail by Tanguy and Nouvel[7]and  is 
represented in Figure 1. The reference points [A..I] 
represent both the communication and measurement nodes 
and a channel between point X to Y point is called XY path. 
The frequency range goes from DCup to 50 MHz. 
Taking into account all the measurements, we have 
observed an insertion loss of about -15 dB up to -36 dB in 
the considered band. The maximal attenuation occurs with 
the longest past GF. The coherence bandwidth BC0.9 (90% 
of the maximum sub-carriers autocorrelation) is given from 
the autocorrelation of the channel frequency obtained with 
different paths,as proposed Vallejo-Mora et al. [11].
