Abstract— The authors have studied new mode of cutaneous 
sensation characteristics on finger pads toward an accurate 
physical-line presenting computer-human interface. A series of 
psychophysical experiments were carried out on motion 
perception characteristics with the raised dots sliding on finger 
pads. As a result, it was found that there were two kinds of 
modes with the perception: (1) dot-counting mode, (2) raised-
dots sliding-speed perceptual mode. The first mode worked in 
the long period of dot spacing and in the low sliding speed 
conditions, and showed such a high accuracy as a 
proprioceptive-sensation-based fingertip motion perception. 
The second mode worked in the short period or in the high 
speed conditions, and suffered ill performance similar to 
sliding flat surface.

 INTRODUCTION 
We can accept such geometrical information of objects as 
the lengths and directions of line-segments via our haptic 
sensations. Therefore, the haptic sensations have been 
expected as an alternative for visually impaired persons to 
create geometrical mental images. In the haptic sensations, 
there are two important factors: the sensation factor and 
initiative factor. As for the sensation factor, not only the 
cutaneous sensation but also the proprioceptive one was 
employed in perceptual processes. On the other hand, as for 
the initiative factor in the hand motion activation, there are 
such two schemes as the passive and active schemes.  
The cutaneous sensation is a principal cue in hand-
stationary passive touches, and is also used as a 
supplementary cue to proprioceptive one in hand-moving 
passive/active touches. Therefore, we can say an importance 
of 
investigating 
human 
cutaneous 
sensations 
for 
understanding the haptic perceptual mechanism. 
Thus, there have been studied many cutaneous-sensation-
based perceptual characteristics. For example, slip length 
perceptual characteristics of moving flat surface were studied 
in [1]~[4]. Under the active touch condition, Hollins et al. 
reported a perceived-length formula as a function of velocity 
and duration [1]. Armstrong et al., focusing on the duration 
time, suggested that the radial–tangential anisotropy in the 
length perception can be explained by temporal differences 
in exploratory movements [2]. In these years, the passive 
length perception scheme has been studied in detail. For 
example, Terada et al. found a complimentary characteristic 
between the cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations and 
proposed some formula representing the perceived length as 
the function of velocity dependence and actual-length [3]. 
Wouter et al. reported that the cutaneous condition (Cu) was 
much inferior to a proprioceptive condition (Pr) and a 
cutaneous-combined proprioceptive condition (CuPr). In the 
CuPr-condition, the cutaneous sensation contributes a little to 
the Pr-condition [4]. Introducing another important aspect of 
movement direction, Yusoh et al. have also presented other 
formulas representing the perceived length as the function of 
velocity dependence and actual-length [5]. 
As for the dots-counting sensation that was an important 
factor in this work, there were few researches except for 
those on vibrotactile sensations. For examples, papers of 
[6~9] took up the perception of single site vibration. 
However, we can’t find such similar studies on moving-
raised-dots produced stimuli as in this work, and papers of 
[10~12] took up the perception of pattern-like vibration.. 
Raised dots have been used for Braille, i.e., dotted letters 
and for tactile-graphics since they have been considered to 
be distinctive and informative stimuli for representing 
geometrical information. Therefore, the raised dots were 
expected to contribute for new physical-line presenting 
interfaces: for example, forming raised dots on actively 
rotating wheel surface, by embedding the wheel, we could 
make up novel active mouse interface. 
Thus, the raised dot was expected to be a promising 
tactile presentation framework. In this study, paying notice to 
the sliding-raised dot pathway perception, the authors have 
studied cutaneous sensation characteristics on finger pads in 
the passive touch scheme. 
In this paper, Section 2 introduced such methodology of 
experiments as the apparatus and procedures. Next,

comparing some related existing works, Section 3 presented 
experimental results with the sliding length perceptual 
characteristics for the short/long period dot specimens. Here, 
it was referred that a transition of the sliding dot perceptual 
mode from dot counting to sliding speed perception occurred 
even in the long period dot specimen. Finally, Section 4 
closed this paper by summarizing important findings.

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
A. Apparatus 
Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus. The length, 
width, and height of table base are 510×500×610mm, 
respectively. It consisted of a power supply, a controller, an 
acrylic plate with a hole, a specimen plate, a linear actuator 
(IAI-ICSA series) and a rotation board. The acrylic plate was 
mounted on the top of the flat plate. A hole was opened at 
the center of the acrylic plate. The specimen plate, to the top 
surface of which paper specimen adhered, was attached on 
the top surface of the linear actuator and it could be moved in 
both the directions within the 300mm range. The gap 
between the acrylic and specimen plates was set at 6mm. The 
linear actuator was, furthermore, mounted to the top of the 
rotation board so that the linear actuator could be rotated and 
be fixed at a direction within 360° with an interval of 22.5°.

Figure 1.  Experimental apparatus: a specimen was moved by a linear 
actuator on a rotation board. 
We introduced two kinds of specimens, on the surfaces 
of which a raised dot pathway was formed so as to be 
aligned in straight: one specimen had a 20.1mm-period of 
raised dots and the other did a 2.5mm-period. The raised dots 
were 1.5mm in diameter and 0.4mm in height (see Figure 2). 
In the case of 20.1mm period dot, the dot appeared one-by-
one on the contacting fingerpad. On the other hand, in the 
other case of 2.5 mm period, multiple dots contacted with the 
fingerpad. This gave birth to an important difference in 
perceptual mode between the two periods. In the case of 
20.1mm period, we could perceive each of the sliding raised 
dots one-by-one with the finger pad cutaneous sensation and 
could count the number. Meanwhile, in the other case of 
2.5mm period, we no longer could not count them but, as an 
alternative, perceived sliding speed of the raised dot. The 
characteristics for both of the perceptual modes were 
discussed in the experiments.

B. Procedures 
1) Conditions 
The line lengths being presented were 50, 75, 100, 125, 
150mm, and the directions were set at 0 to 360° with an 
interval of 22.5°. Therefore, the number of presented lengths 
was five and that of the directions was 16. In the case of 
20.1mm period, the lengths, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150mm, 
corresponded to 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 dots, respectively. The 80 
line segment patterns by 5 lengths and 16 directions were 
presented in pseudo random orders. All the experiments were 
carried out with the speeds of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 
and 200mm/s. Five subjects aged 22 to 57 years old 
participated in the experiments. 
2) Task 
In the case of 2.5mm period dots, the subjects were 
informed to perceive both the sliding length and direction 
during the dotted paper specimen sliding on his fingerpad. 
They were also asked to make oral reports of the perceived 
length and direction with the character-represented codes: 
the codes were written on an answer board being showing 
concentric circles, of which radii were 5 to 200mm with a 
5mm interval (see Figure 3). In the other case of the 
20.1mm-period-dot, the subjects were informed to count the 
number of the dots, and also to perceive the sliding direction 
as one of the 16 candidate directions during the dotted 
specimen sliding on their finger pad. Just after the slide 
having been finished, the subjects made oral reports of the 
frequency of counted dots, and the perceived direction.

perceived direction and length from a word set shown in the answer board 
3) Procedures 
Figure 4 shows some experimental views. Subjects were 
seated in a chair, setting their right forearm on the acrylic 
plate. During experiments, subjects were instructed to relax, 
and to focus on to perceive the presented linear slide motions. 
The subjects put their index fingerpad on the surface of a flat 
specimen (Figure 4(a)) where the subject arm angle was set 
at 90° (Figure 4(b)-(d)), and the arm direction was set to 
horizontal to table base (Figure 3(c)). The subject aligning 
his shoulder in the frontal plane and holding his upper body 
not twisted at the waist was placed at the position so that his 
right arm was parallel to the sagittal plane direction and so 
that his index fingertip was located at the hole in the acrylic 
plate (Figure 4(d)). A white noise sound was applied to the 
subjects via headphones for masking any sound cues on the 
spatial perception. In an arbitrary waiting time, after the 
subject put his fingerpad on a specimen, the specimen started 
to move, and stopped at a given point with approximate 
rectangular velocity pattern: by using the linear actuator, the 
specimen was accelerated with 3 m/s2, then, it was moved 
with constant speed after reaching at the predetermined 
speed, and it was finally decelerated by 3 m/s2. 
The direction of the linear actuator movement was set by 
manual operation each time. The velocity and direction were 
pseudo-randomly presented for each of the subjects. It took 
about 30 minutes for the whole experiment per a subject.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. From Dot Counting to Sliding Speed Perception 
Figure 5(a) shows an experimental result for the 20.1 mm 
period raised dot specimen. In this figure, counted dot 
numbers were inverted into length dimension by multiplying 
20.1. In this case, a speed-caused fewer-counting effect in 
means (it is rephrased as a speed-caused foreshortening 
effect from the viewpoint of the length dimension) can be 
seen clearly. However, it should be noted that there can be 
seen little mean errors in the case of the 25 mm/s velocity. 
This characteristic will be useful to develop the motion 
presenting interfaces in the future. To make clear actual and 
counted dot number relationship, changing the parameters 
from the lengths to speeds, we got Figure 5(b) from Figure 
5(a). From this figure, we can see the length-related 
foreshortening effect, especially, in high speed conditions. 
As a whole, it can be said that, the more the velocity/length 
is, the bigger the mean error grows. On the other hand, as for 
random errors, the longer the actual length was, the more the 
STD of the actual dots number increased.

Figure 5.  Experimental results with the 20.1 mm period raised dots 
The other experimental result is shown in Figure 6 for the 
2.5 mm period raised dots. 
For each of the 20.1 mm and 2.5 mm period dot 
experiments, we formulated a model for the perceived length 
lest_perc by using a power function of actual length lact and 
velocity v.  
lest_perc =α v
β lact 
γ

The power function model is a variation of Stevens’ law, 
and it represents contraction effects along with increased 
speed and length. In the ideal case that there are no such 
effects, the exponents with respect to lact and v, i.e., β and γ, 
are respectively 1 and 0, and the proportional coefficient is 1. 
When estimating the unknown parameters, we took 
logarithms of the both sides of Eq. (1). That is,  
ln lest_perc = lnα β lnv γlnlact 
For the 20.1 mm period experiment, after converting the 
counted dot numbers into lengths, we got  
lest_perc = 2.2 v 
-0.20 lact 
0.95

For the 2.5 mm period experiment, we got 
lest_perc = 6.7 v 
-0.11 lact 
0.62

Since the coefficients of determination for each of the 
above simple two models accounts for 99%, the models were 
considered to be adequate. 
The length-related exponentγ of 0.95 for the 20.1 mm 
period was very close to 1, and was much superior to that of 
0.62 for the 2.5 mm period.  
On the other hand, the speed-related exponent β of -0.20 
for the 20.1 mm period was a little different from the ideal 
value of 0, and was inferior to that of -0.11 for the 2.5 mm 
period. It was considered that, even for the 20.1 mm period, 
the subjects were no longer able to count dot number in the 
increased speeds, and suffered larger speed-induced 
contraction effect. Therefore, it was recommended to employ 
enough low speeds when using the 20.1 mm period.

B. Discussion (Comparison to Existing Works) 
In this section, the above explained perceptual models 
with raised dots were compared with the existing two haptic 
length perceptual models.  
One was a Terada model [3] that was obtained under the 
cutaneous-sensation-only framework as same as this work, 
that is, the Terada model was obtained by a cutaneous only 
sensation for flat sliding surfaces. The model was similar to 
the Najib model [5]. In Figure 7, the Terada-modeled 
perceived-lengths are shown by lines, and the 2.5mm period 
experimental values in this work were shown by symbols. It 
was interesting that, as a whole, this work of 2.5mm period 
was good conformity with Terada model except for the data 
with 140.7 mm length. It suggested that the dot period of 2.5 
mm no longer worked as dot planes but as simple planes 
practically.

Figure 7.  Comparison of the 2.5 mm period experiments to Terada work: 
the symbols show the means in this work, and the lines show the calculated 
values by the Terada model. 
The other was Hollins model [1] that was obtained under 
an advantageous framework employing both the cutaneous 
and proprioceptive sensations. In Figure 8, the Hollins-
modeled perceived-lengths are shown by lines, and the 
20.1mm period experimental values in this work are shown 
the symbols. For both the length and speed variations, the 
20.1mm period experimental values well agreed to the 
Hollins model. In Hollins’ experiment, not only the 
cutaneous sensation but also the proprioceptive one being 
effective in haptic length perceptions was employed. 
Contrary to the advantageous Hollins framework employing 
both the cutaneous and proprioceptive sensations, this work 
of the cutaneous-sensation-only framework might inherently 
have poor sensitivity. Nevertheless the dot period of 20.1 
mm worked as well as the advantageous Hollins model as 
shown in Figure 7. For reference, the cutaneous sensation 
was reported to be not much effective by Wouter et al. [5]  
Finally, relating to the perception of moving dots, there 
were some significant works using Braille interfaces, e.g., 
[10~12]. Using 2×4 dot Braile cells (6.42mm in width, 
16.7mm in height), Tahir et al. [11, 12] conducted some 
experiments on dot pattern selection tasks where 8 kinds of 
dot patterns were presented either by impulsive way or by 3 
Hz of vibration. They obtained an elapsed time of 823ms in 
average for the vibrating patterns that was a little bit longer 
than that of 642ms for the impulsive patterns: the 
comparative merit of impulse to vibration had been agreed 
with the former work by Pietrzak et al. based on 4×4 dot 
Braile cells[10]. Here, it would be remarked that the 3 Hz 
vibration chosen in [11, 12] and the 1/0.6 Hz vibration in 
[10] respectively corresponded to a speed of 60.3mm/s and 
33.5mm/s in the case of 20.1 mm period specimen in this 
work. The correspondence supported our results that the 
subjects showed the best performance at the 25 mm/s speed 
condition in dot number counting task and subject reports. 
That is, subjects reported that they were no longer able to 
count the dots when the speed was increased to 50 mm/s and 
over, and that have changed their perceptual strategy from 
counting strategy into another cutaneous sensation of 
depressed point movement perception as in the 2.5mm 
period dot spacing.

IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Paying notice to the sliding raised dot pathway 
perception in the passive touch framework, the authors have 
studied the cutaneous sensation characteristics on index 
fingerpad. 
 
By using a power function of actual length lact and 
velocity v, we formulated a model for the perceived 
length lest_perc for each of the 20.1 mm and 2.5 mm 
period dots. 
 
The length-related exponent γ of 0.95 for the 20.1 
mm period was very close to the ideal value of 1, 
and is much superior to that of 0.62 for the 2.5 mm 
period. On the other hand, the speed-related 
exponent β of    -0.20 for the 20.1 mm period was a 
little different from the ideal value of 0, and was 
inferior to that of -0.11 for the 2.5 mm period.  
 
In comparisons from relating works, under the 
cutaneous-sensation-only framework, this work of 
the 20.1mm period dot showed such a high length 
perceptual performance as another advantageous 
framework employing both the cutaneous and 
proprioceptive sensations. Meanwhile, this work of 
the 2.5mm period dot showed almost similar 
performance as with other cutaneous-sensation-only 
works based on simple planes.  
 
In the future, the authors will make a profound study on 
the 
raised-dot-based 
line 
perceptual 
characteristics: 
increasing sample number, expanding variations of dot 
period, and extending from one-dimensional lines to two 
dimensional lines. Furthermore, by using raised dots, they 
will develop computer-human interfaces, i.e., fingerpad-
based line displays.
