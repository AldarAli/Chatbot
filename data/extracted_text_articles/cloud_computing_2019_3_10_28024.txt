Abstract—The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
has been with us now since the 25th May 2018. It is certainly the
case that in many of the 28 EU countries, regulators were not all
properly resourced by the starting deadline. However, progress
has been made since then. We review the challenges faced by
cloud users, and consider whether all the compliance challenges
existent then have persisted, and whether there are any other
challenges that have evolved. We examine the most serious risks
faced by cloud users and consider how users might mitigate their
exposure to these hard problems. We provide a series of practical
solutions which might help them to keep abreast with these issues
while proper long term solutions can be found.

INTRODUCTION
It is certainly the case that the new EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1], has some serious teeth,
with maximum ﬁne levels for each breach being the greater of
e20million or 4% of global turnover. It is also the case that
a number of cloud vulnerabilities are still unresolved, and are
frequently exploited by attackers. This results in a potential
nightmare scenario for cloud users where they are unable to
ensure compliance with the regulation. In May last year, 17 out
of 24 regulators polled in a Reuters survey [?], claimed they
would not be ready in time for the new regulation. However,
in addition, other jurisdictions are now taking a lead from the
EU to implement regulations or legislation of their own.
In the US, the State of California introduced their own
version of the EU GDPR within a month of it going live
[2]. Currently, the White House is working on introducing
stringent data protection legislation based on the model of the
EU GDPR. It is likely to be only a matter of time before other
jurisdictions follow suit. For global corporates in particular,
this is likely to present a serious challenge to their ability
to demonstrate compliance with these regulations and other
legislation. Make no mistake, there is no doubt that these
regulators have a serious intent, and there is little doubt that
they will exercise their considerable powers to bring unwilling
cloud users into line.
We start by looking at the most serious challenges high-
lighted by two cloud security organisations — the Cloud
Security Alliance (CSA) [3], and the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP) [4]. The CSA were set up specif-
ically to examine cloud security issues. The OWASP project
was initially set up to examine Web based vulnerabilities, but
over time extended their remit to incorporate mobile, internet
of things and cloud vulnerabilities as well. Both organisations
collect data on vulnerabilities and make good suggestions to
help mitigate these issues. Both issue a report every three
years which brings attention to their understanding of the most
serious vulnerabilities.
Achieving information security is a big challenge already
for all companies who use conventional distributed network
systems, but once cloud systems are involved, the challenge in-
creases exponentially. This mainly arises due to the complexity
that the many issues of additional relationships and agendas
of different participant companies involved brings to cloud
ecosystems. Much research has been carried out to attempt
to resolve these problems e.g., [5]–[14].
One of the most challenging, and as yet, still not properly
unresolved issue is the cloud forensic problem [15]. Many are
aware of it, but no-one seems to be prepared to discuss it, let
along try to properly resolve the problem. It is of course a
technical problem to address, but that does not mean it can
be left unresolved. Regulators will quite rightly expect some
mitigating steps be taken to address the issue, rather than
allowing companies to trust to luck.
If any company using cloud is unable to resolve the
cloud forensic problem, we suggest this will present such a
fundamental issue that it will be impossible for that company
to comply with this new regulation. As far back as 2011 and
in subsequent years [16]–[22], a great deal of research was
focussed on trying to resolve this issue, yet it is clear from
looking at regulatory ﬁnes for breaches that the message is
not getting though.
In 2012, Verizon estimated that a total of 174 million data
records were compromised [23]. Yahoo disclosed a 1 billion
compromised account breach in the 2013 attacks, yet when
Verizon took over Yahoo two years ago, it turned out that
ALL 3 billion accounts had been compromised [24]. By 2017,
records compromised had increased to an estimated 2 billion
records lost or compromised in the ﬁrst half of 2017 alone [25].
In the last year, it is estimated by Gemalto in their Breach
Level Index, that over 4.5 billion data records were lost or
stolen in the ﬁrst half of 2018 [26], an increase of 133% on
the same period in 2017. The current level of data records
lost is running at 6.4 million records per day [27], of which
only 4% were encrypted. It is clear that data breaches are
continuing at an alarming rate. Of particular concern is the
96% of unencrypted records compromised being exposed.
In Section II, we look at the top cloud vulnerabilities
identiﬁed by both the CSA and OWASP. In Section III, we
look at what the Cloud Forensic Problem is, and address why
it is such a challenging problem to overcome. In Section IV, we
address the minimum requirements necessary to achieve com-

pliance. In Section V, we look at whether this approach will
ensure good security and privacy is possible. In Section VI, we
consider future developments of this work, and in Section VII,
we discuss our conclusions.
II.
THE MOST SERIOUS CLOUD VULNERABILITIES
We start by looking at the most recent vulnerability list for
the CSA and OWASP. Their most recent list was published in
2017, and is based on the most damaging vulnerabilities for
the 2016 year. We can see the comparison in the Tables below.

It is clear that each has taken a completely different
approach to the perceived vulnerabilities, thus expanding the
range of the most important vulnerabilities to a total of 22.
In the case of the CSA, they have take the approach of
identifying the 12 most important technical challenges faced
by cloud users. On the other hand, OWASP have completely
changed their approach by shifting to the Behaviour Driven
Development (BDD) process, which shifts the focus away
from technical issues alone to encompass all the stakeholders
in cloud and in particular the business procedural oriented
aspects. They further develop this by taking a risk-based
approach, and have identiﬁed the 10 most dangerous risks
facing cloud users.
While technical challenges are vitally important to address,
it is equally important to address the risks which address
mostly the non-technical element of cloud use. When we
realise that the business architecture of a company comprises
a combination of people, process and technology [30], and
not technology alone, we can start to see how combining
these two different approaches will have value. However, we
have only considered two aspects of the foundational triad of
business architecture. We must also consider the impact of
people challenges.
People have long proved to be a serious security weakness
in organisations. It is clear that criminals have long realised
that the easiest way to successfully attack any system is
through the weakest link — and that is invariably always
people. We list here some 16 extremely successful social
engineering attacks. We must add a proviso that these attacks
are not speciﬁc to cloud users only, but they are common
indeed. In fact, social engineering became the most successful
attack vector in 2015 [31].
TABLE III: 16 SUCCESSFUL SOCIAL ENGINEERING AT-
TACKS c⃝2019 Duncan
Attack Name
Attack Description
Phishing
These are the most common type of attacks leveraging social eng-
ineering techniques. Attackers use emails, social media, instant
messaging, and SMS to trick victims into providing sensitive
information or visiting a malicious URL in an attempt to
compromise their systems.
Watering Hole
A “watering hole” attack consists of injecting malicious code into
the public Web pages of a site that the targets are known to visit.
Once a victim visits the page on the compromised website a
backdoor trojan is installed on their computer
Whaling Attack
This is an extension of a Phishing attack, used to steal conﬁdent-
ial information,personal data, access credentials to restricted serv-
ices/resources and speciﬁcally information with relevant value
from an economic and commercial perspective. This is targeted at
executives of private companies and government agencies,
hence the use of whaling to describe the “big ﬁsh”
Pretexting
This term describes the practice of pretending to be someone
else, such as an external IT services operator in order to obtain
private information.
Baiting &
Baiting exploits the user’s curiosity, with the promise of some
Quid Pro
good that the attacker uses to deceive the victim, often with a
Quo Attacks
malicious ﬁle disguised as a ‘security’ update. The Quid Pro Quo
or ‘something for nothing’ attack offers a service or beneﬁt to the
victim in exchange for information, or facilitation of an attack
Tailgating
This is where an attacker gains physical entry to a restricted area
in contravention of security policy by walking through behind an
authorised person when they enter a secure area
Deceptive
Arises when attackers attempt to replicate a legitimate company
Phishing
email account to elicit information from the victim
Spear Phishing
These attacks are specially tailored for a single victim using
knowledge obtained from social media proﬁles and other
public sources of information, exposing the victim to identity
theft, malware, credit card fraud and even blackmail
Whaling /
In this attack, victims are asked to provide information or to
CEO Fraud
authorise payment urgently at the behest of the CEO
Vishing
This is where an attack is perpetrated by Voice over IP (VoIP).
Becasue the VoIP server can be made to look like anything, it
can appear that the call is coming from an important outside
entity such as a bank or the Inland Revenue
SMiSHing
This attack purports to come via SMS, and asks the victim
to respond by clicking on a malicious link, or calling the
attacker’s phone, who then tries to extract information
W2 Phishing
This is where the attacker pretends to be a senior executive
or an external service like the Inland Revenue in order to
obtain personal information such as NI numbers
Pharming
This is more sophisticated than Phishing, whereby the attacker
used cache poisoning to purport to come from an ofﬁcial
web site.
Ransomware
This Phishing variant contains a link to download malware
Phishing
usually in the form of ransomware
Dropbox
This Phishing variant purports to come from Dropbox and
Phishing
seeks to obtain private ﬁles and photos usually
leading to blackmail
Google Docs
This variant of Phishing spoofs the Google Docs login page and
Phishing
seeks to collect the victim’s userid and password
These attacks are particularly well crafted and have proved
to be exceptionally successful in tricking victims into giving up
sensitive information, passwords and so on. Often, they look
every bit as good as ofﬁcial communications, despite the fact
that sometimes they are poorly constructed, or use poor English

grammar and spelling. While it is fair to say that the social
engineering attacks equally relate to non-cloud environments,
nevertheless, they still present a serious challenge to the cloud
environment.
Now, we can see that it is clear that not only is the business
architecture of any company comprised of a combination of
people, process and technology, but so too are attacks crafted
to attack each of these sectors.
III.
THE CLOUD FORENSIC PROBLEM (AND WHY IT IS
SUCH A HARD PROBLEM)
While all computing systems are constantly under attack,
this can present a far more serious issue for users of cloud
systems. Once an attacker gains a foothold in a cloud system
and becomes an intruder, there is little to prevent the intruder
from helping themselves to any amount of data, especially that
which is covered by the GDPR, either by viewing it, modifying
it, deleting it or ex-ﬁltrating it from the victim system [32]–
[34]. Worse, should the intruder gain sufﬁcient privileges, they
are then able to completely delete all trace of their incursion,
perhaps deleting far more records than they need to in the
process, leading to further problems for business continuity.
After the intruder has removed every trace of the intrusion,
the forensic trail will have little left to follow, which means
many companies will be totally unaware that the intrusion
has taken place, let alone understand what records have been
accessed, modiﬁed, deleted or stolen. This leads to a serious
issue for companies who believe they have retained a full
forensic trail in their running instance. They frequently fail to
realise that without special measures being taken to save these
records off-site [8], everything will vanish when the instance is
shut down, often by the intruder. In such a case, there will be
no mitigating factor that the company can use, rendering them
liable to the full force of the penalties under the regulation.
In any cloud based system, there is a need to ensure a
complete and intact audit trail is stored off cloud in order for
the breached organisation to be able to tell which records have
been accessed, modiﬁed, deleted or stolen. Otherwise, if the
audit trail and all forensic records have been deleted, there will
be no physical means for any organisation to be able to tell
which records have been accessed, modiﬁed, deleted or stolen,
putting these organisations immediately in multiple breaches
of the GDPR. This will also pose a serious impediment to
using business continuity plans for recovery.
Thus, in addition to the 38 attacks discussed in the previous
section, we must now add this difﬁcult challenge to the list.
IV.
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO ACHIEVE
COMPLIANCE WITH THE GDPR?
Simply address the above 39 points and we will be com-
pliant, yes? Sadly, the reality is that those actions alone will
not guarantee compliance, and we will explain the reason in
the following subsections.
A. Cloud Security Alliance
It is not as simple as dealing with our 39 identiﬁed vulner-
abilities. If we start with the CSA top 12 vulnerabilities, this
represents just the 12 most damaging vulnerabilities. The CSA
maintains a full list of all known cloud vulnerabilities, which is
known as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
list [35]. The list comprises all known vulnerabilities which
are, or are expected to become public. The CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA) [36], assigns all such identiﬁed CVEs with a
unique number, which are then published in the MITRE CVE
database [37]. Workarounds and ﬁxes, as they are developed,
are associated with the appropriate CVE number.
This list also feeds the National Vulnerability Database
(NVD) [38], which was launched by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) [39], in 2005. NIST provide
a range of enhanced information about each vulnerability
including such information as ﬁx information, severity scores
and impact ratings. The NVD also offers this information by
Operating System (OS); by vendor name; product name, and/or
version number; as well as by vulnerability type, severity,
related exploit range and impact. NIST also offer the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [40]. The ﬁrst version,
released in 2005, following feedback was updated to V2 in
2007, and following further feedback was updated to V3 in
2015.
The following website provides a list of 12 free online tools
to test your website to scan for website security vulnerabilities
and malware.

Likewise for the OWASP issues. These represent only the
top 10 issues. OWASP also provide suggestions to address or
mitigate each issue.
There is also another organisation, WAVSEC [42], who
have compiled a list of 51 companies who provide both
proprietary and open access tools to test your website for
OWASP and other vulnerabilities.
C. Social Engineering
Since social engineering attacks are attacks on people,
there are no software tools available to test for the presence
of such attacks on any system, making the job of defence
rather more challenging. It is therefore necessary to ensure
that companies keep on top of the ever increasing range of
new attacks being developed, so that proper training can be
made available for every single employee in the company.
It will also be important to ensure that adequate training is
provided to ensure that actors who are not employees of the
company, such as suppliers, customers and others are made
aware of the dangers surrounding these attacks. Additional
security provisions and monitoring may be necessary to ensure
a higher level of protection is available.

D. The Cloud Forensic Problem
We have seen that to do nothing would not be a viable
option as far as GDPR compliance is concerned. Attacks will
continue unabated. We must therefore be prepared and armed
with whatever tools we can develop to ensure we achieve
as high a level of compliance as we possibly can. For a
pragmatic approach to helping resolve this problem Duncan
and Whittington [43], make some practical suggestions to
mitigate this potential problem.
We therefore need to consider what the absolute minimum
technical requirement might be to attain our objective of GDPR
compliance. We know that under the GDPR the organisation
must be able to:
•
provide a Right of Access (under Article 15) to
personal data by data subject, if requested;
•
provide the means to comply with a Right to Erasure
(under Article 17) by data subject, subject to the
appropriate grounds being met;
•
provide privacy by design;
•
in the event of a data breach, report the breach to the
Supervisory Authority within 72 hours after having
become aware of the data breach (Article 33). The
breach must also be reported to the controller without
undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data
breach;
•
in the event of a data breach, notify the data subject
if adverse impact is determined (under Article 34),
unless the data was encrypted;
To meet the ﬁrst requirement, we must ensure the prove-
nance and veracity of the contents of the database. For the
second requirement, if appropriate, the same provision would
apply.
For the third requirement, the cloud system must be de-
signed in accordance with the recommendations of the Article
29 Working Party [44], which suggests the reports produced
by ENISA should be followed. This report [45], speciﬁes
that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out
locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data
must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is
to be achieved. Furthermore, it speciﬁes that outsourced data
storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe, as
long as only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the
decryption keys. ENISA have also produced a stream of other
relevant reports, including a Cloud Risk report in 2009 [46],
and recommendations for certiﬁcation in 2017 [47].
For the fourth requirement, we would require to ensure the
provenance and veracity of the contents of the database. For the
ﬁfth requirement, where the data is not yet encrypted, the same
provision would also apply. However, it should be stressed that
it will always be preferable to ensure data is encrypted before
it leaves the control of the data owner.
It is clear that where no steps have been taken to ensure the
cloud forensic problem has been mitigated, the organisation
will fail on every count. Thus, as a minimum, we need to
ensure the following steps are taken:
•
all personal data should be encrypted, and this should
be performed locally;
•
the encryption and decryption keys should not be
maintained on the cloud instance;
•
a full audit trail of the entire database must be main-
tained off-site;
•
full forensic records of all users having accessed
the database and carried out any commands on the
database must be collected and stored off-site.
V.
WILL THIS APPROACH PROVIDE GOOD SECURITY AND
PRIVACY?
The business architecture of a company comprises a combi-
nation of people, process and technology [30], not technology
alone. As we have seen in Section III, all three aspects of the
business architecture are subject to attack. We saw how social
engineering attacks in Table III, could be used effectively
against people in the business. From the OWASP weaknesses
list in Table II, we see how effectively processes can be
attacked, and from the technical attacks in Table I, how a
wide range of effective attacks can be perpetrated agains the
technological systems of the company.
We must, of course, understand that we cannot simply
address each of the three areas in isolation, but must instead
be prepared to consider the possibility that an attack could end
up compromising the company more easily through combining
attacks from two or more of the three sectors to develop an
even more effective attack.
Thus, we must take a multi-pronged approach to keeping
our cloud systems secure:
•
People
◦
Keep abreast of evolving social engineering
attacks
◦
Train the people in the organisation regularly
to recognise these attacks and deal with them
properly
•
Process
◦
All processes must be properly documented
and kept up to date
◦
All processes must be checked for potential
vulnerabilities
•
Technology
◦
Test continually for vulnerabilities
◦
Monitor constantly
◦
Analyse logs regularly
◦
Constantly review for new evolving vulnera-
bilities and exploits
•
Cloud Forensic Problem
◦
Encrypt all data
◦
Ensure data is backed up off-cloud
◦
Ensure encryption/decryption keys are stored
off-cloud
In addition, we should regularly check all systems to
ensure no new vulnerabilities or weaknesses have appeared.
We should regularly check for evolving threats and take
appropriate mitigatory action. We should perform continuous
monitoring and analytics on all systems to ensure they are as up
to date and secure as possible. Adding an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) would
also be a prudent measure to take.

There are two essential tasks that must be performed to
ensure the effectiveness of this approach. Persistent storage
in the running cloud instance cannot retain data beyond its
currently running lifetime [8], so we need to ensure that all
necessary logs and data is stored securely elsewhere. Also,
since the default settings for the majority of all database
software involves logging being turned off by default [32],
it is essential that we turn it on in all running cloud instances,
with the data being stored securely elsewhere.
All of these measures will give us a much higher chance
of achieving a good level of security and privacy, as well as
the means to deliver a compliant system from the point of
legislative and regulatory requirements.
VI.
FUTURE WORK
We need to understand what data we require to keep. To
meet our legislative and regulatory compliance requirements,
we need to understand the 5 W’s — namely: Who is accessing
our system? Where have they come from? What are they
looking for? When is this happening? From this data, we
should be able to infer the Why? Are they authorised to be
in the system, to enter the system the way they have, to look
at the data they are trying to access, and at the time they are
trying to access it? Deducing the Why can give an indicator
of anomalous behaviour.
We plan to construct a working model based on the ideas
outlined in this paper with which to test this solution over the
next 6 months, which will allow us to conﬁrm how well it
might work in the real world. It is not overly complicated to
be able to do this, which means even the smallest business
would have the means to ensure proper compliance can be
achieved.
VII.
CONCLUSION
As each of the EU countries gets their regulators properly
in place and responding to breaches, and as their expertise
starts to grow, there is no doubt that the level of ﬁnes will
start to grow.
Once serious ﬁnes start to be levied, it is likely that many
companies will start to get the message, and will ﬁnally wake
up to the seriousness of this particular regulation. The forth-
coming GDPR ﬁnes will certainly get some serious attention.
In this paper, we have considered whether it is possible to
achieve regulatory compliance where any organisation is using
cloud computing. It is clear that without suitable precautions
being put in place, the answer is a resounding “No!”.
We have outlined the key requirements from the GDPR
to which all organisations falling under its jurisdiction must
comply. We have identiﬁed the currently unresolved “Cloud
Forensic Problem” as presenting the largest obstacle to achiev-
ing compliance. We have proposed how this challenging prob-
lem may be approached to ensure that cloud users can be fully
compliant with this new regulation, with little more than being
sensibly organised. Clearly, additional cost will require to be
incurred, and there may be a small impact on latency, but
these costs could signiﬁcantly mitigate the possibility of a huge
regulatory ﬁne in the event of a breach. It is also likely that
this approach will ensure faster discovery of the occurrence
of a breach, thus minimising the potential impact on business
continuity.
