Abstract—Marine operations in cold climates are subjected to 
heavy ice accretion, which can lead to heavy ice loads causing 
safety concerns. Atmospheric and sea spray icing can cause 
severe ice accretion on structures. Ice detection over the 
relatively larger surface area of marine platforms and vessels 
could be significant for ice mitigation and its removal in cold 
climates. A thermal ice signature can be considered a useful 
property that could be detected using the Infrared (IR) cameras. 
To study this remote ice detection option, preliminary lab 
experimentation was performed to detect thermal gradients 
over two different surface areas of a pure ice sample at room 
temperature. A complete thermal signature over the surface 
area was detected and recorded until the meltdown process was 
completed. The proposed technique can be useful in detecting 
ice over large areas in cold marine environments than point 
detection ice sensing. However, challenges remains in terms of 
the validation of the detection signature and elimination of false 
detection.

 INTRODUCTION  
Ice accretion problems are challenging in the cold climate 
regions. With a rise in activity in the arctic frontier, icing 
phenomena will increasingly affect operational activities. 
The sources of icing may vary according to environmental 
conditions, for instance atmospheric icing (snow, rain, fog) 
[1] or sea spray icing generated due to wind or wave-structure 
collision [2]. In marine icing events, combination of the 
mentioned causes could also be the case. An example of this 
is the snow that sticks to a wet surface caused by the sea 
spray. All of the discussed factors can cause heavy ice 
accumulation on offshore and mobile platforms operating in 
the cold climates [3]. Adequate measures are required to 
minimize the influence of atmospheric and sea spray icing 
events on structures under different conditions and, therefore, 
effective anti/de-icing techniques become important [4]. 
These techniques involve thermal, chemical and mechanical 
methods to avoid and/or remove the ice [5]. Most often the 
problem arises in situations where unpredicted or unexpected 
environmental conditions occur that could cause heavy ice 
accretion phenomena, as the ice accretion rate is high enough 
to become a possible threat to the structure. In such cases the 
time elapsed becomes the critical factor in responding in an 
effective manner, which also includes ice mitigation and 
removal. A viable option available is timely ice detection 
over the structure during heavy icing events, which should 
support the anti/de-icing systems. Timely detection can be 
important to the mitigation of heavy ice loads upon 
structures.  
In this paper a brief insight into the concept of infrared 
(IR) thermography is given in Section II. Suitable 
wavelengths to detect cold objects with infrared detectors is 
also discussed. Section III gives the details about the 
preliminary experimentation performed to evaluate the IR 
thermal signature of a pure ice block and the results are 
discussed in Section IV. Also included is a brief discussion 
on remote IR detection in marine operations, which will be 
the applicability of this research project followed by the 
concluding remarks in Section V.

IR THERMOGRAPHY AND THERMAL SIGNATURE 
DETECTION AT LOW TEMPERATURES 
IR light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength 
longer than that of visible light, measured from the nominal 
edge of visible red light at 0.74μm and extending 
conventionally up to 300μm. Figure 1 shows the IR spectral 
band that is generally sub-divided into four sub-bands; near 
infrared (NIR) ranges between 0.75–1μm, shortwave infrared 
(SWIR) is from 1-2.5 μm, middle infrared (MWIR) is 
between 3–5μm, longwave infrared (LWIR) is between 8–
14μm. 
 
Figure 1. IR Spectrum [6] 
For cold objects near 0°C, the prominent radiation 
wavelength is near 11 μm. Since most commercial IR sensors 
use wavelengths between 8 to 14 μm, IR thermography can 
be handful for surface ice studies [7]. Theoretically, each 
body at any temperature above absolute zero will emit some 
radiation, but the intensity and frequency distribution of the 
radiation is different based on the basic structure of the body.

The energy emitted by a true blackbody is the maximum 
theoretically possible for a given temperature. The radiative 
power (or number of photons emitted) and its wavelength 
distribution are given by the Planck’s radiation law (given by 
(1) and (2)), where λ is the wavelength, Τ is the temperature, 
h is Planck’s constant, ϲ is the velocity of light, and k is 
Boltzmann’s constant.

Figure 2 shows a plot of these curves for a number of 
blackbody temperatures. With a rise in temperature, the 
energy emission at any given wavelength increases 
respectively and the wavelength of peak emission decreases, 
which is specified by Wien’s displacement law. The 
waveband 1–15 µm in the IR region of the electromagnetic 
spectrum contains the maximum radiative emission for 
thermal imaging purposes.

The working principle of an IR camera is based on 
thermography imaging. The major components of the camera 
are lens, detector, video processing electronics and user 
interface control. The incident beam of light is focused by the 
lens upon the detector. The detector contains the IR sensitive 
elements arranged in the array called focal plane array (FPA). 
These are IR sensitive elements and miniature in size (micro-
meters). The resolution of FPA determines the resolution of 
the IR imagery produced by the camera. Many IR cameras 
available have user interface to calculate the scene 
temperature along with imagery recording software. 
Calibration is often required to read out the correct 
temperature across the scene that is captured.  
With the advancement in the IR camera-technology, 
significant work has been done to observe ice/snow emissive 
properties to support remote microwave detection. Snow and 
clear ice have high emissivity values, which makes them 
convenient to thermally image. Snow emissivity has been 
variously found to be 0.98 for frost [9], above 0.98 for small-
grained snow under 1000 μm [10], 0.96 for flat solid ice and 
water, and as low as 0.8 for old snow. Measurements obtained 
at particular wavelengths (e.g. 10 μm) have observed 
emissivity as high as 0.995. Conversely, the thermal 
reflectance of snow r is less than 2.3% between the 4 to 14 
μm wavelengths [11]. This holds good for various snow types 
including granular, fine, wet, and dry; whereas newly fallen 
snow reflectance is less than 1% between 4 to 14μm. For most 
of the 7.5 to 13μm spectrum, the emissivity is found higher 
in comparison. Therefore, IR cameras operating in the range 
above 7.5μm can prove significant to observe cold objects.  
 
III. 
PURE ICE BLOCK THERMAL SIGNATURE 
In order to test the potential of IR ice detection, it is 
necessary to evaluate the thermal signature of icing. In order 
to observe the IR signature of pure ice, lab experimentation 
was performed. The sample was prepared from freezing tap 
water in a commercial freezer. The dimension of the ice block 
prepared was 14.5 x 14 x 5.5 cm. Although the dimensions 
were randomly chosen, it was taken into consideration that the 
ice block should have a large enough surface area to allow 
observation of a differentiating thermal signature and a wide 
range of temperature profiles. As a starting point, the viewing 
angle of the IR camera and the ice sample was kept at 90 
degrees. The forward-looking IR camera FLIR A310 was 
used to observe the thermal signature of the block using the 
proprietary software of the FLIR device. The observations 
acquired were produced in the mentioned calibrated software. 
FLIR A310 series IR camera has a detector operating in the 
range of MWIR (8-11µm). The thermal signature was 
recorded immediately from the time when sample was taken 
out of the freezer. The observations were recorded until the 
melt-down phenomena had started at room temperature and 
surface of the ice block acquired a uniform temperature.  
The lab setup performed is shown in the Figure 3. An 
attempt was made to observe a freely suspended ice block in 
order to ensure the uniform heat transfer from all directions. 
To hold the ice block on the stand, a wooden piece was 
immersed into the cold water during freezing process, so that 
it could be used as a suspension support assisted by a clamping 
stand as shown in Figure 3. Minimal thermal conduction from 
the ice block was expected from the wooden support (since 
the wood has poor conductivity), apart from fulfilling the 
suspension support requirement. The ice block was initially 
frozen to approximate -26°C and suspended on the stand 
immediately after taking out of the freezer and observed from 
IR camera. FLIR A310 has an uncooled detector device that 
sends IR frames processed at the rate of 5Hz. The FLIR 
calibrated software acquires the frames and saves them as a 
sequence file. The camera to software communication is 
performed via an Ethernet protocol. The IR image of the larger 
surface-1 and relatively smaller surface-2 (Figure 3) was 
recorded at room temperature to evaluate the surface 
temperature profiles.

The temperature observations were made along a linear path 
along the ice block’s centre line to capture the maximum 
thermal gradient across the surface. This helped to acquire the 
maximum and minimum temperature profiles over the 
surfaces 1, 2 (Figure 4). Minimum temperatures of -26.5°C 
for surface-1 and -23.7°C for surface-2 were recorded. The 
gradual rise in temperature for both the surfaces was observed 
simultaneously as the heat transfer process took place at room 
temperature. The observations for surface-1 are noted after 
regular intervals of time t0 to t0+32 and also simultaneously 
for surface-2 as shown in Figure 4. The thermal IR signature 
available from the camera optics was captured during the 
course of the observations, which presents the distribution of 
the thermal profile as shown in Figure 5. The lowest 
temperature profile was observed almost at the centre of the 
ice block surfaces whereas the maximum temperature at the 
boundaries.

DISCUSSION 
Pure ice has a high emissive value and it produces a 
distinguishable thermal signature shown in Figure 5. The ice 
block suspended through the wooden stick allowed the ice to 
conduct heat uniformly. The IR observations show the 
thermal gradient from the centre of the ice block towards the 
outside, which follows the heat transfer process. The heat 
conduction through the boundary layer of the ice can be 
easily identified from the thermal signatures as shown in

Figure 5. The minimum temperature at surface-1 is -26.5°C 
at t0 (Figure 4), which is located in the geometric centre of 
the surface. A similar behaviour is observed at surface-2. In 
terms of the maximum temperature profile at the boundary 
layers, not much difference was observed between both the 
surfaces. The highest temperature of 0.92°C was observed at 
the boundary of surface-1 at t0 as compared to the 1.1°C of 
surface-2 shown in Figure 4. The maximum-minimum 
difference in the two surface areas was noted as surface-1 has 
wider span of temperature range as compared to the surface-
2 possibly because of the larger surface area. The maximum-
minimum temperature difference at time t0 to t0+32 for 
surface-1 was 6.44°C, 9.61°C, 7.32°C, 6.98°C and 4.07°C 
respectively. At similar time intervals (t0 to t0+32 ) for 
surface-2, the difference between maximum and minimum 
temperature  recorded was 5.99°C, 5.24°C, 3.2°C, 3.2°C and 
1.59°C. The temperature profiles of the ice block can be 
correlated with the isothermal images shown in the Figure 5. 
In the IR image of both the ice surfaces the difference in 
thermal signature can also be observed at the boundary layer 
of the ice block, which is at a higher temperature as compared 
to the rest of the surface block. The temperature profile 
decreases from corners to the centre of the ice block. Since 
the room temperature was uniform throughout the 
experiment, it can be safely said that maximum heat transfer 
occurred from the boundary through natural convection.  
 It is to be noted that the wide range of the IR profile of 
the pure ice block also assists in differentiating it with a 
relatively hotter environment, though in a cold climate 
environment this may not be the scenario. IR detection for 
colder objects seems to works well as long as thermal non-
uniformity is present in the scene which is to be observed. 
Currently, offshore structures and marine ships operating in 
cold environment use thermal methods for anti/de-icing, 
apart from other methods. Thermally active heated floors will 
generate a predictable IR signature. Ice accretion on the 
floors may result in different thermal signature. This variation 
may be used for ice detection and may also lead to the 
detection of the ice accretion rate if used in conjunction with 
heat transfer theory.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The thermal signature of icing can be applied to detect 
cold objects especially ice accreted upon the structures. The 
lab experimentation shows the thermal signature and gradient 
of two surface areas of a pure ice block. The results shown 
are preliminary and only reflect the changes in temperature 
due to warming of ice block under room temperature. LWIR 
FLIR A310 camera can be used to monitor IR signature of 
ice. Study of ice block showed that temperature varies over 
time with maximum value at the boundaries and minimum at 
the centre. The difference between the boundary and the 
centre temperatures is higher on a larger surface area. The 
influence of emissivity values on ice detection is not 
discussed here and needs to be further investigated. 
Considering marine arctic operations, an IR imaging device 
is to be tested and advanced experimentation is needed to be 
performed to validate the ice detection and growth.
