Abstract— Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a 
promising technology that can jointly be used to accomplish 
the typical lighting functionalities of the Light-Emitting Diodes 
(LEDs) and data transmission, where light intensity can be 
modulated on a high rate that cannot be noticed by the human 
eye. A VLC cooperative system that supports guidance services 
and uses an edge/fog based architecture for wayfinding 
services is presented. The dynamic navigation system is 
composed of several transmitters (luminaries) which send the 
map information and path messages required to wayfinding. 
Each luminaire for downlink transmission is equipped with 
one two type of controllers: mesh controller and cellular 
controllers to forward messages to other devices in the vicinity 
or to the central manager services. Data from the luminaires is 
encoded, modulated and converted into light signals emitted by 
the transmitters. Tetra-chromatic white sources, located in 
ceiling landmarks, are used providing a different data channel 
for each chip. Mobile optical receivers, collect the data, 
extracts 
theirs 
location 
to 
perform 
positioning 
and, 
concomitantly, the transmitted data from each transmitter. 
Uplink transmission is implemented and the best route to 
navigate through venue calculated. The results show that the 
system allows determining the position of a mobile target 
inside the network, to infer the travel direction along the time 
and to interact with information received optimizing the route 
towards the destination.

INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, wireless networks have seen a demand for 
increased data rate requirements. For a realistic coverage 
with the data rate requirements, a large bandwidth is needed 
which remains a limiting factor when compared with the RF 
communication technologies. The advancement in data 
streaming and multimedia quality has an adverse effect on 
the available radio spectrum, which is soon set to hit a 
roadblock. Consequently, research has started exploring 
alternate wireless transmission technologies to meet the 
ever-increasing demand. In this context, the huge bandwidth 
available in the unlicensed electromagnetic spectrum in the 
optical domain is seen as a promising solution to the 
spectrum crunch. Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
makes use of the higher frequencies in the visual band and 
extends the capabilities of data transmission using general 
light sources [ 1 ][ 2 ]. It transmits data by high-speed 
switching or flickering at a rate that is not perceivable to the 
naked eye. VLC has been regarded as an additional 
communication technology to fulfill the high data rate 
demands and as a new affiliate in the beyond fifth-
generation (5G) heterogeneous networks. It can be easily 
used in indoor environments using the existing LED lighting 
infrastructure with few modifications [3] [4]. This means 
that the LEDs are twofold by providing illumination as well 
as communication. Therefore, communications within 
personal working/living spaces are highly demanded. Multi-
device connectivity can tell users, from any device, where 
they are, where they need to be and what they need to do 
when they get there. Research has shown that compared to 
outdoors, people tend to lose orientation a lot easier within 
complex buildings [5] [6]. Fine-grained indoor localization 
can be useful, enabling several applications [7] [8].  
To support people’s wayfinding activities this paper 
proposes a method able to generate ceiling landmark route 
instructions using VLC. Tetra-chromatic white sources are 
used providing a different data channel for each chip and 
offers the possibility of Wavelength Division Multiplexing 
(WDM), which enhances the transmission data rate. The 
system is composed of several transmitters (LEDs 
luminaries) which send the map information and path 
messages required to wayfinding. Data is encoded, 
modulated and converted into light signals emitted by the 
transmitters. Every mobile terminal is equipped with a 
receiver module for receiving the mapped information 
generated from the ceiling light and displays this 
information in the mobile terminal. The receiver modules

includes a photodetector based on a tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H 
pin/pin light controlled filter that multiplexes the different 
optical channels, performs different filtering processes and 
finally decodes the encoded signals, recovering the 
transmitted information [9] [10] [11]. This kind of receiver 
has proved to be adequate when used in large indoor 
environments with a 2D building model [12]. The proposed 
LED aided system involves wireless communication, smart 
sensoring and optical sources network, building up a 
transdisciplinary 
approach 
framed 
in 
cyber-physical 
systems. 
The paper is organized as follows. After the 
introduction (Section I), in Section II, a VLC scenario, 
architecture and building model are established and the 
dynamic navigation system explained. In Section III, models 
for the VLC link are presented and in Section IV, the 
communication 
protocol 
and 
the 
encoding/decoding 
techniques are analyzed and the wayfinding evaluation 
discussed. Finally, in Section V, conclusions are addressed. 
II. 
SCENARIO, ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING MODEL  
A. 
Scenario 
When we are looking for the shortest route to a place, we 
want to be guided on a direct, shortest path to our 
destination. A destination can be targeted by user request to 
a Central Manager (CM).

Figure 1. Optical infrastructure and indoor layout. Proposed scenario: a 
user navigates from outdoor to indoor. It sends a request message to find 
the right track and, in the available time, he adds customized points of 
interest (wayfinding services). The requested information is sent by the 
emitters at the ceiling to its receiver. 
So, self-localization is a fundamental issue since the person 
must be able to estimate its position and orientation (pose) 
within a map of the environment it is navigating.  
The scenario simulated is a 3D complex building. 
Different users are considered (Figure 1). Depending on the 
time available, they can find a friend, shop, have a meal or 
rest. When arriving, they notify the CM of their localization 
(x, y, z), asking for help to find the right track for their 
needs (wayfinding services). A code identifies each user. If 
a user wishes to find a friend both need previously to 
combine a common code for the schedule meeting. The first 
arriving initiates the alert notification to be triggered when 
the other is in his floor vicinity and generates a buddy list 
for the meeting. The buddy finder service uses the location 
information from the network’s VLC location from both 
users to determine their proximity and sends a response 
message with the location and path of the meeting point 
avoiding crowded regions and minimizing the path. 
We consider the path to be a geometric representation of 
a plan to move from a start pose to a goal pose. Let us we 
consider a person navigating in a 2D environment (Figure 
1). Its non-omnidirectional configuration is defined by 
position (x, y, z) and orientation angle, , with respect to the 
coordinate axes. q(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t), (t)] denote its pose at 
time t, in a global reference frame. In cooperative 
positioning systems, persons are divided into two groups, 
the stationary persons and the moving persons. Let’s 
consider that qi(t,t´) represents the pose of person i at time t´ 
relative to the pose of the same person at time t and qij(t) 
denotes the pose of person j relative to the pose of person i 
at time t. qi(t,t´) is null for people standing still and non-zero 
if they move. These three types of information qi (t), qi 
(t,t´)and qij (t) compose the basic elements of a pose graph 
for multi-person cooperative localization. 
 
B. 
Mesh cellular hybrid structure  
In Figure 2, the proposed architecture is illustrated. A 
mesh cellular hybrid structure to create a gateway-less 
system is proposed. This network configuration is wireless 
and ad-hoc. It spans all devices, is wire free, demonstrate 
resiliency to physical obstructions and adapt to changes in 
the transmission medium. A mesh network is a good fit 
because it dynamically reconfigures itself and grows to the 
size of any installation [13]. As illustrated in Figure 2, the 
luminaires, in this architecture, are equipped with one of 
two types of nodes: A “mesh” controller that connects with 
other nodes in its vicinity. These controllers can forward 
messages to other devices (I2D) in the mesh, effectively 
acting like routers nodes in the network. A “mesh/cellular” 
hybrid controller, that is also equipped with a modem 
providing IP base connectivity to the central manager 
services (CM). These nodes act as border-router and can be 
used for edge computing. Under this architecture, the short-
range mesh network purpose is twofold: enable edge 
computing and device-to-cloud communication, by ensuring 
a secure communication from a luminaire controller to the 
edge computer or datacenter (I2CM), through a neighbor 
luminaire controller with an active cellular connection; and 
enable peer-to-peer communication (I2IIP), to exchange 
information between smart devices.

Figure 2. Mesh and cellular hybrid architecture.  
To estimate each person track the pure pursuit approach 
[14 ] [15 ] is used. The principle took into account the 
curvature required for the mobile receiver to steer from its 
current position to its intended position. By specifying a 
look-ahead distance, it defines the radius of an imaginary 
circle. This allows to iteratively construct the intermediate 
arcs between itself and its goal position as it moved, thus, 
obtaining the required trajectory for it to reach its objective 
position (see Figure 1).  
 
C. 
Building model 
Building a geometry model of interiors of buildings is 
complex since the interior structure has to be seen as an 
aggregation of several different types of objects (rooms, 
stairs, etc.) with different shapes. In the proposed 
architecture the logical model is easier since represents each 
room/crossing/exit with a node (Figure 1), and a path as the 
links between nodes. By integrating floor number 
information into the previous 2D system, the overall 
performance of the system will not be significantly affected. 
The user positions can be represented as 𝑃 (𝑥, 𝑦, z) by 
providing the horizontal positions (𝑥, 𝑦) and the correct 
floor number z. The ground floor is level 0 and the user can 
go both below (z<0) and above (z>0) from there. In this 
study, the 3D model generation is based on footprints of a 
multi-level building that are collected from available 
sources (luminaires) and are displayed on the user receiver 
for user orientation. It is a requirement that the destination 
can be targeted by user request to the CM and that floor 
changes are notified. The indoor route throughout the 
building is presented to the user by a responding message 
transmitted by the ceiling luminaires that work also either as 
router or mesk/celular nodes (Figure 2). With this 
request/response concept, the generated landmark-based 
instructions help the user to unambiguously identify the 
correct decision point where a change of direction (pose) is 
needed, as well as offer information for the user to confirm 
that he/she is on the right way. 
III. VLC LINK MODELS  
The principal components of the VLC system are the 
LEDs which act as the communication sources and the SiC 
WDM devices that serve as receiving elements as pointed 
out in Figure 3. Data from the sender is converted into an 
intermediate data representation, byte format, and converted 
into light signals emitted by the transmitter module. The 
data bit stream is input to a modulator where an ON–OFF 
KEYING (OOK) modulation is utilized. Here, a bit one is 
represented by an optical pulse that occupies the entire bit 
duration, while a bit zero is represented by the absence of an 
optical pulse.  
LEDs are modeled as Lambertian source where the 
luminance is distributed uniformly in all directions, whereas 
the luminous intensity is different in all directions. The 
luminous intensity for a Lambertian source is given by 
Equation 1. [16]: 
 
Iሺ∅ = I𝑁ሺcos ∅ 𝑚                            
Where m is the order derived from a Lambertian pattern, IN 
is the maximum luminous intensity in the axial direction 
and ,  is the angle of irradiance. The Lambertian order m is 
given by: 
m = −
ln⁡(2)
ln  cos൫∅1/2  
 
 
 
For the proposed system, the commercial white LEDs 
were designed for illumination purposes, exhibiting a wide 
half intensity angle 
) of 60º. Thus, the Lambertian 
order m is 1.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. – Geometry of the relative position of the transmitter 
and receiver units. 
The light signal is received by the WDM photodetector 
that detects the on/off states of the LEDs, generates a binary 
sequence of the received signals and convert data into the 
original format.  For simplicity, we will consider a line of 
sight (LoS) connection for both VLC links, which 
corresponds to the existence of straight visibility between 
the transmitter and the receiver. In  Figure , it is plotted the 
geometry of the transmitter and receiver relative position,

to 
the 
main 
parameters 
used 
for 
characterization of the LED source and the photodiode 
receiver (angles of irradiance and illumination, transmitter’s 
semi-angle at half-power and field of view). The Lambertian 
model is used for LED light distribution and MatLab 
simulations are used to infer the signal coverage of the LED 
in the illuminated indoors space [17] [18].  
Lighting in large environments is designed to illuminate 
the entire space in a uniform way. Ceiling plans for the LED 
array layout is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Illustration of the optical scenarios (RGBV =modulated LEDs 
spots). Clusters of cells in square topology .  
A square lattice topology was considered. Here, cells 
have squares shapes to form an orthogonal shaped 
constellation with the modulated RGBV LEDs at the nodes. 
 The LEDs emit light when the energy levels change in 
the semiconductor diode. The wavelength depends on the 
semiconductor material used to form the LED chip. For data 
transmission, commercially available polychromatic white 
LEDs were used at the nodes of the network. On each node 
only one chip is modulated for data transmission and carries 
useful information while the others are only supplied with 
DC to maintain white color illumination. Red (R; 626 nm), 
Green (G; 530 nm), Blue (B; 470 nm) and violet (V; 390 
nm) LEDs, are used [19] [20]..  
Since lighting and wireless data communication is 
combined, each luminaire for downlink transmission 
become a single cell, in which the optical access point (AP) 
is located in the ceiling and the mobile users are scattered 
within the overlap discs of each cells underneath. So, each 
node, X i,j, carries its own color, X, (RGBV) as well as its ID 
position in the network (i,j). The grid sizes were chosen to 
avoid overlap in the receiver from adjacent grid points. To 
receive the information from several transmitters, the 
receiver must be positioned where the circles from each 
transmitter 
overlaps, 
producing 
at 
the 
receiver, 
a 
multiplexed (MUX) signal that, after demultiplexing, acts 
twofold as a positioning system and a data transmitter. The 
device receives multiple signals, finds the centroid of the 
received coordinates and stores it as the reference point 
position. Nine reference points, for each unit cell, are 
identified giving a fine grained resolution in the localization 
of the mobile device across each cell. The overlap regions 
(footprints) are pointed out in Figure 4. 
Planning the route to follow from the current position to 
a goal point is achieved with the help of a CM linked to the 
ceiling landmarks (Figure 2). To compute the point-to-point 
along a path, we need the data along the path. The input of 
the aided navigation system is the coded signal sent by the 
transmitters to an identify user, and includes its position in 
the network P(x, y, z), inside the unit cell and the steering 
angle, , that guides the user across his path. In Figure 4, the 
steering angles are pointed out as dotted arrows and the 
associated codes displayed.

The data was coded using an On-Off keying (OOK) 
modulation in a 64-bits word, divided into five blocks. All 
messages, in a frame, start with the header labelled as Sync, 
a block of 5 bits. The same synchronization header [10101], 
in an ON-OFF pattern, is imposed simultaneously to all 
emitters. The next block (ID) gives the geolocation (x,y,z 
coordinates) of the emitters inside the array (Xi,j,k). Cell’s 
IDs are encoded using a 4 bits binary representation for the 
decimal number. The first bit represents the number's sign: 
setting that bit to 0 is for a positive number, and setting it to 
1 for a negative number, the remaining 3 bits indicate the 
absolute value of the coordinate. So, the next 12 (4+4+4) 
bits in are assigned, respectively, to the x, y and z 
coordinates (i, j, k) of the emitter in the array.  
In 
the 
proposed 
architecture, 
bi-directional 
communication is available through the mesh/cellular nodes. 
Each user sends to the local controller a “request” message 
with his pose (x,y,z, ), user code (pin1) and also adds its 
needs (code meeting and wayfinding data). If the message is 
diffused by the CM transmitter, a pattern [0000] precedes 
this identification. When bidirectional communication is 
required, the user has to register by choosing a user name 
(pin1) with 4 decimal numbers, each one associated to a 
colour channel. So, to compose the decimal code each digit 
(0-9) has its own colour, codified in a 4-binary bit code. If 
buddy friend services are required a 4-binary code of the 
meeting (pin2) has to be inserted. The coded steering angle 
() completes the pose in a frame time (Table 2). The codes 
assigned to the pin2 and to  be the same in all the channels. 
If no wayfinding services are required these last three blocks 
are set at zero and the user only receives its own location. 
The last block is used to transmit the wayfinding message. 
A stop bit is used at the end of each frame.  
The calibration of the receiver supplies an additional tool 
to enhance the decoding task and includes the simultaneous 
modulation of the four RGBV emitters in the cell [21]. The 
resultant optical signal is a combination of the all the 
possible optical excitation (24), which results in 16 possible 
photocurrent levels at the photodetector. Under these 
conditions, when all possible signal output levels are well 
distinct, it is possible to infer the corresponding input 
optical states.  
Taking into account the frame structure, results from 
Figure 5, show that the user located at C2,3,-1,  arrived first 
(t1), identified himself ("7261") and has informed the 
controller of his intention to find a friend for a scheduled 
meeting ([0011]; 3). Then, a buddy list was generated and 
includes all the users who have the same meeting codes. 
User “3009” arrives later sends the alert notification (C4,4,1; 
t3) to be triggered when his friend is in his floor vicinity, 
identifies himself (“3009”) and uses the same code, in the 
buddy wayfinding services (code 3), to track the best way to 
his meeting. After this second request, the buddy finder 
service uses the location information from both user devices 
to determine the proximity of their owners and sends a 
response message with the best route to the meeting.  
Figure 6, shows the decoded messages from the two users as 
they travel to the pre-scheduled meeting. The trajectory 
followed (poses) is shown on the right side of the figure. At 
the top the figure the simulated scenario is illustrated.

Figure 6.  Decoded messages from the two users as they travel to a pre-
scheduled meeting. 
Data shows that user “7621” starts (t1) his journey on 
floor -1, C2,3,-1; #1W, goes up to floor 1 in C2,1,-1 and at t2 he 
arrives at C4,1,1  heading for E. During his journey, user 
“3009” from C4,4,1 #1 asks the CM (t3) to forward him to the 
scheduled meeting and follows course to W. At t4 both 
friends join in C4,3,1. 
The existence of congested zones can be locally detected by 
the “mesh / cellular” hybrid controller (Figure 1a), which is 
also equipped with a modem providing IP base connectivity 
to the central manager. The hybrid controller integrates the 
number of requests and individual poses, qi (t), received 
during the same time interval. Once the individual poses are 
known, the relative poses, qij (t) are calculated. An alert 
notifies the user of the best route.

CONCLUSIONS  
A VLC multi-person cooperative localization dynamic 
LED-assisted positioning and navigation system was 
proposed based on ceiling landmark route instructions using 
VLC. A 3D building model for large indoor environments 
was presented, and a VLC scenario in a multilevel building 
was 
established. 
The 
communication 
protocol 
was 
presented. Bi-directional communication between the 
infrastructure and the mobile receiver was analyzed. Global 
results show that the location of a mobile receiver, 
concomitant with data transmission is achieved. The 
dynamic LED-aided VLC navigation system enables to 
determine the position of a mobile target inside the network, 
to infer the travel direction along the time and to interact 
with received information.  
The VLC system, when applied to large building, can 
help to find the shortest path to a place, guiding the users on 
a direct, shortest path to their destinations.
