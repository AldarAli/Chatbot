Abstract—Currently, the orthogonal frequency division mul-
tiplexing (OFDM) systems use a predetermined cyclic preﬁx
(CP) that is conservatively designed for the longest anticipated
delay spread to overcome the multipath propagation delays. The
most important parameter for determining the CP is power
delay proﬁle which is widely accepted to be following a negative
exponentially decaying pattern. In this paper, the key parameter
root mean square (r.m.s) delay spread of the power delay proﬁle
is mathematically derived based on the exponentially decaying
power delay proﬁle. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) power delay proﬁles are ﬁtted into the exponentially
decaying power delay proﬁle (EDPDP). The performance mea-
sure bit error rate (BER) is used to evaluate the effectiveness of
the EDPDP and its r.m.s delay spread. The ﬁndings show that
EDPDP can be used to characterize the most of the power delay
proﬁles. Subsequently, a mathematical formula to calculate CP
estimation is derived. As a result, it is found that the CP is the
natural logarithm of the ration of maximum power to minimum
power of a particular power delay proﬁle multiplied by its r.m.s
delay spread. This ﬁnding gives the relationship between the
maximum access delay and r.m.s delay spread as far as CP is
concerned.

I. INTRODUCTION
New generation of wireless mobile radio systems aims to
provide higher data rates to the mobile users as well as serving
many users. Therefore, adaptation methods are becoming
popular for optimizing mobile radio system transmission and
reception at the physical layer as well as at the higher layers
of protocol stack. These adaptive algorithms offer performance
improvement, better radio coverage and high data rates with
low power consumption. Several adaptation schemes require a
form of measurement or estimation of one or more variables
that may change over time [1]. Therefore, one way of increas-
ing the spectral efﬁciency is to adapt the length of the cyclic
preﬁx (CP) which varies depending on the radio environment
[2]. The most important parameter for determining the CP
is power delay proﬁle which is widely accepted to follow
a negative exponentially decaying pattern [3, 4]. Considering
the fact that the multipath effect is highly dependent on the
deployed environment in which the wireless system operates,
the width of a CP is chosen in such a way that it is larger
than the maximum access delay of the propagation channel.
The CP is determined by the maximum access delay or by
the root mean square (r.m.s) delay spread of that environment
multiplied by a constant in the range between two to four as
a rule of thumb [5].
The cyclic preﬁx adaptation in this study is composed of two
parts. The ﬁrst part is to prove that the exponentially decaying
power delay proﬁle (EDPDP) can be used to characterize
power delay proﬁles. Then, the EDPDP model has been used
to derive a mathematical formula for estimating the cyclic
preﬁx in OFDM system. The second part of the study focuses
on how the channel impulse response (CIR) can be obtained
during one OFDM frame. This can be achieved by transmitting
predetermined bits in the OFDM pilot subcarriers in the
transmitter part. On the receiver part, the minimum mean
square error (MMSE) or least square (LS) channel estimators
can be used to estimate the CIR. Subsequently, the power delay
proﬁle (i.e., the energy taps) can be directly obtained from the
CIR [6, 7].
In order to gauge the necessary adaptive CP, the power
delay proﬁle (energy taps) ﬁrstly should be ﬁtted into the
EDPDP model. Consequently, the CP model which is derived
in this paper can be used to get the expected CP. This
predicted CP can be used by the receiver in the subsequent
transmitted frame. Therefore, by using this technique, it is
expected to adapt the CP for each OFDM frames dynamically.
Assuming that the mobile user is under low mobility condition;
consequently, the power delay proﬁle and its r.m.s delay spread
are assumed to be stationary during one OFDM frame time.
This paper will focus on the ﬁrst part of the study. In
order to prove the validity of the proposed models, the 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) channel models are
ﬁtted into the EDPDP model. Besides, the decaying constant
of the EDPDP is estimated for each power delay proﬁles.
Subsequently, OFDM physical layer simulation is used to
validate the accuracy of the proposed models (i.e., the EDPDP
and the CP models) in terms of bit error rate (BER). In the
transmitter part, the CP is increased in steps in order to reduce
the effects of the 3GPP power delay proﬁles which are used to
characterize the effects of the multipath signal. Next, the BER
performance is plotted for these different CP values. Lastly,
the CP which gives the minimum BER is compared with the

estimated CP. It is found that estimated CP is always in the
vicinity of the optimum CP value.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows; in Section II,
a formula for r.m.s delay spread is derived based on EDPDP
model. The concept of curve ﬁtting techique is explained in
Section III. A new CP formula is adopted in Section IV. The
OFDM physical layer simulation which is used to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed models is clearly explained in
Section V. The Performance of the EDPDP and CP models in
terms of BER are discussed in Section VI. Meanwhile the main
ﬁndings are elucidated in Section VII. Finally, the conclusion
derived from this study is stated in Section IX.
II. THE R.M.S DELAY SPREAD OF THE EDPDP
The delay spread is a type of distortion that is caused when
identical signals arrive at different times at their destination.
The signals usually arrive via multiple paths with different
angles of arrival. The time difference between the moment
of arrival of the ﬁrst multipath component (typically the
line-of-sight component) and the last multipath component is
called the maximum access delay. Additionally, the r.m.s delay
spread (τr.m.s) is deﬁned as the square root of the second
central moment of the power delay proﬁle P (τ). The formula
for calculating the delay spread for multipath signals is deﬁned
as [8]:
τrms =

where τi and Pi are the arrival time and power of ith path
respectively. In the case of continuous power delay proﬁle,
the (τr.m.s) is deﬁned as [8]:
τrms =
sR ∞
0 (τ − m)2Ph(τ)dτ
R ∞

(2)
where m is the mean of access delay which is also deﬁned
as:
m =
R τmax
τmin τP (τ) dτ
R τmax
τmin P (τ) dτ
(3)
where τmin and τmax are the arrival times of the ﬁrst path
and the last path respectively. As agreed by some researchers,
the power delay proﬁle is negatively exponentially decaying
[3,4], it is possible to formulate the power delay proﬁle as:
P = P0e−ατ
(4)
where P0 is the power when τ = 0, α is the decaying
constant and τ is the multipath signal arrival time. The mean
of the power delay proﬁle (m1) can be calculated as:
m1 =
Z τmax
τmin
τP0e−ατdτ
(5)
In turn, Equation 5 is solved to produce:
m1 =

(8)
Now, τmean is deﬁned as the mean time which can be
obtained by normalizing the mean of power delay proﬁle (m1)
by the total sum of all arrived powers (I0) which can be
deﬁned as:
I0 =
Z τmax
τmin
P0e−ατdτ =
−P0
α e−ατ
τmax

(9)
From the aforementioned deﬁnitions, the mean time τmean can
be articulated as:

Similarly, the second moment (m2) of the power delay
proﬁle can be deﬁned as:
m2 =

As can be seen from Equation (23), the r.m.s delay spread is
inversely proportional to the decaying constant. Subsequently,
the r.m.s delay spread which is just derived from the EDPDP
model will be identiﬁed as (ˆτrms) in this chapter in the
following sections.
III. FITTING THE POWER DELAY PROFILES INTO THE
EDPDP MODEL
Since it is required to get the value of r.m.s delay spread
(i.e., α), and the power delay proﬁle is always a discrete
proﬁle, there is a need to use the least squares curve ﬁtting
technique to ﬁt the power delay proﬁle into the EDPDP model.
As a case study, the power delay proﬁles are obtained from
the 3GPP channel models as shown in Table I. These channel
models are ﬁtted into the EDPDP model; as a result, the
EDPDP coefﬁcients P0 and α are estimated. For the sake
of simplicity, the P , P0 , α and τ in Equation (4) are
substituted by y ,A ,−B and x respectively, which ﬁnally gives
the EDPDP model as:
y = AeBx
(24)
taking the natural logarithm for both sides:
lny = lnA + Bx
(25)
leta = lnA and b = B , then the sum of all the errors squared

τmin = −τrmsln(γ/P0)
(36)
Now, the required CP based on maximum access delay
concept is deﬁned as:
CP = τmax − τmin
(37)
Substitution of Equations (35) and (36) into Equation (37)
yields:
CP = τrms(lnγ/P0 − lnβ/P0)
(38)
CP = τrmsln
γ
β

(39)
In Equation (39), the CP is a function of γ , whereby γ
is the power of the ﬁrst path as deﬁned earlier. Interestingly,
the value of γ depends on the propagation distance between
the mobile station and the base station. Subsequently, the
propagation distance is a function in the long term fading
model. Accordingly, it is possible to hypothesize that there
is a connection between the proposed CP model and the long
term fading model.
V. THE OFDM PHYSICAL LAYER SYSTEM DESIGN
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed mod-
els, a detailed link level simulation has been developed to
investigate the physical layer performance of the IEEE 802.16e
air interface. The functional blocks used in the transmitter and
receiver chain of the link level simulation are shown in Figure
(2).
Functional blocks of the OFDM system are implemented
according to IEEE 802.16-2004 and IEEE 802.16-2005 with
the exception of pulse shaping, which is outside the scope of
standards. The ﬁrst box in the block is the Bernoulli binary
generator which is the information bits generator. The function
of the second box is for channel coding which is composed
of Forward Error Correction (FEC) and interleaving. For FEC,
Fig. 2.
The OFDM transceiver block diagram
the conventional encoder is used, which is the only mandatory
coding scheme according to IEEE 802.16e-2005 speciﬁcation.
The conventional encoder mother code rate (R0) is and its
memory size is 6. After bit interleaving is used, the system
uses the 16 PSK mapping scheme. At the input of the Inversed
Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), the data selector is used to
form the OFDM symbol which consists of 1024 subcarriers
(i.e., Nfft = 1024) . This OFDM symbol is constructed from
720 data subcarriers, 120 pilot subcarriers, 183 guard subcar-
riers and one direct current (DC) subcarrier which is used as a
center frequency. Before transmitting the OFDM symbol, CP
is added it in order to mitigate the effect of the multipath.
This CP is added at the front of the OFDM symbol which
is a duplication of the tail of the useful symbol with ratios
of G = 1/512, 1/256, 1/128, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2;
where G is the CP to useful symbol time ratio. The other sys-
tem parameters are the channel bandwidth BW = 10MHz,
sampling factor n = 28/25 , sampling frequency Fs =
(n × BW/8000) × 8000 = 11.2MHz , subcarrier spacing
f
= Fs/Nfft = 10.9375 , useful symbol time Tb =
1/f = 91.42857µs ,CP = G × Tb and OFDM symbol time
Ts = Tb + CP . The value CP and Ts depend on the values
of G as shown in Table (III).

VI. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CYCLIC PREFIX MODEL
The purpose of this section is to validate the efﬁciency of
the CP model using the 3GPP channel models which consist
of three power delay proﬁles. The ﬁrst power delay proﬁle
is the Rural Area channel model (RAx), the second one is
the Typical Urban channel model (TUx) and the last one is
the Hilly Terrain channel model (HTx) as shown in Table
(I). The 3GPP channel models are ﬁtted into the EDPDP

and the r.m.s delay spread is calculated using the standard
formula and the proposed formula as shown in Table (II).
The curves in Figure (3) show the BER of RAx power delay
proﬁle. It can be clearly seen that the minimum BER occurs
when G = 1/128 and its corresponding CP = 0.71429µs as
shown in Table (III). On the other hand, the estimated (CP)
is CP = ˆτrmsln

γ
β

= 0.528µs as shown in Table (IV).
Additionally, it can be observed that when the CP increases
(i.e., G increases to 1/64), there is no enhancement in BER
performance. This means that the optimal CP occurs when
G = 1/128. Moreover, it is observed that when the CP
increases ( G increases), the BER performance degrades. This
is due to the fact that the BER is inﬂuenced by two factors. The
ﬁrst factor is inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and the second
factor is the power consumption. When the CP increases,
the effect of ISI is eliminated. Nevertheless, since the CP
is considered as an additional transmitted data, transmitting
these additional data needs to increase the transmitted power in
order to maintain the same BER performance. In other words,
increasing the CP size needs to increase transmitted power
in order to keep the same BER. Therefore, increasing CP size
while keeping the same amount of power for the OFDM frame,
this will leads to a degradation in BER performance.

as shown in Table (IV). As a result, the proposed CP can
be formulated as CP = 4 × τrms. This result of this study
seemed to conﬁrm the ﬁnding of a study by Arslan who found
that the CP equals τrms multipled by a constant in the range
between two to four [5]. As a result, the calculation of CP
based on maximum access delay or based on r.m.s delay spread
multiplied by 4 will give the same result.
VII. FINDINGS
It is possible to consider γ as the main signal meanwhile the
rest of the multipath signals can be considered as interference
signals (i.e., β). Therefore, the main contribution of this paper,
it gives the required span between the main signal γ and the
others interference signals. This span can be used to eliminate
the ISI when the r.m.s delay spread is used to calculate the
CP. This ﬁnding is parallel with the ﬁnding in [10, pp. 77-78],
in which the CP length is proposed to be adjusted as:
CP = β0τrms
(40)
Therefore, when we compare Equation (39) with Equation
(40), we will ﬁnd that:
β0 = ln
γ


(41)
As a result, Equation (41) can be used to get the relationship
between CP and required span instead of the look up table that
has been proposed in [11].
VIII. DISCUSSIONS OF THE EDPDP AND CP MODELS
What is interesting in Equation (23) is that the r.m.s delay
spread depends on the decaying constant α . The decay
of the multipath signals depends on the attenuation caused
by reﬂected and diffracted objects that surround the mobile
station. This leads to an important fact that the r.m.s delay
spread depends on the environment that surrounds the mobile
station[5].
Next, as seen in Table (III) and Table
(IV), the EDPDP
model gives an acceptable level of precision for the r.m.s delay
spread values indicating that all other types of power delay
proﬁles can be represented by the EDPDP. This assumption
is compatible with electromagnetic propagation phenomenon
where the electromagnetic multipath signals reach the re-
ceiver after being reﬂected or diffracted from the surrounding
walls of the buildings. In fact, the multipath signals are
propagating through different propagation distances; therefore,
they have different power levels. These power levels are
inversely proportional to the propagation distances; as the
propagation distance increases, the propagation time delay also
increases. Therefore, the multipath signals should decay as
their propagation distances increase. Moreover, the multipath
signals encounter the same amount of power absorption loss.
However, it is possible to ﬁnd some paths that are reﬂected; for
instance, from glass windows and metal doors, these paths that
are reﬂected from such surfaces face an absorption loss slightly
different from the ﬁrst category. As a result, it is possible to
ﬁnd some paths arriving late but with power levels still higher
than the ones which arrived earlier. However, the curve ﬁtting
technique will compensate for this kind of effects.
IX. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the EDPDP model is proposed to charac-
terize the power delay proﬁles, and its r.m.s delay spread is
mathematically derived. The required CP for mitigating the
inﬂuence of ISI in OFDM is also formulated. Fitting the power
delay proﬁles into the EDPDP and using Equation (39), the
necessary required adaptive CP can be achieved. In addition,
there are two methods that are being used to estimate the
CP; the ﬁrst one is based on maximum access delay and the
second is based on r.m.s delay spread multiplied by 4. The
proposed CP model clearly shows that there is a mathematical
relationship between these two methods. In addition, such
proposed CP model conﬁrms that these two methods lead to
the same result.
