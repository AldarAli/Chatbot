Abstract - Software engineering (SE)-specific process models 
and their notation, such as the Software & Systems Process 
Engineering Metamodel, are typically not specified or available 
in an executable form that can provide automated guidance in 
human-centric software engineering workflows. These SE 
process models generally remain abstract in order to be 
broadly applicable, and when any are concretized, they often 
exist only in the form of documentation. Thus, they are not 
actually relevant operationally, affecting process utilization 
and governance. On the other hand, common business process 
modeling notation such as BPMN is generalized and not 
conducive for providing the context-aware support needed for 
executable SE workflows.  Thus, a practical method is needed 
that supports comprehensive SE process documentation, yet 
also provides an SE workflow modeling capability that can 
transform documented SE workflows into an enactable form 
executable in today's workflow management systems. The 
method presented in this paper can utilize an available 
comprehensive SE process documentation meta-model and 
automatically extract incorporated SE concepts and workflow 
concepts to a workflow model, specifically the Software 
Engineering Workflow Language (SEWL). From this the 
following 
are 
supported: 
1) 
graphical-based 
workflow 
modeling, 2) model-based transformation of workflow concepts 
to diverse workflow management systems (WfMS), and 3) the 
semantic transformation of SE concepts to contextually-aware 
process-centered software engineering environments. The 
results show the viability and practicality of such a method to 
document, extract, graphically model, transform, and enact SE 
workflows in support of contextual guidance capabilities for 
software engineers.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This article extends our previous work in [1]. In order to 
be generally applicable to various software development 
projects, most software engineering (SE) process models 
remain abstract and require tailoring to the specific project, 
team, and tool environment. Examples of SE process models 
include the V-Model XT [2] (specified for all public-sector 
IT development in Germany) and the Open Unified Process 
(OpenUP) [3]. Typical SE process models are documented to 
a great extent in natural languages, and are thus not easily 
executable 
in 
an 
automated 
form. 
The 
technical 
implementation of an executable process, whose sequence 
can be modeled with and automatically enacted in a 
workflow management system (WfMS), is called a 
workflow. SE workflows, many of which are human-centric, 
can cover some sequence of activities and steps related to 
requirements, design, testing, etc., for instance Activity 
Flows in VM-XT [4] or workflows in OpenUP [5].  
Because they integrate SE concepts, SE process meta-
models can be useful in the modeling and comprehensive 
documentation of such SE processes. For instance, the 
Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) [6] is an open source 
project for software process engineering that provides a 
framework and supporting tools, one being the EPF 
Composer (EPFC) [7] for method and process authoring and 
publishing. It utilizes a process meta-model, the Unified 
Method Architecture (UMA), a large extent of which was 
adopted into the Software & Systems Process Engineering 
Metamodel (SPEM) 2.0 [8]. 
Additionally, process-centered software engineering 
environments (PCSEEs) have attempted to investigate and 
address automated guidance and assistance mechanisms for 
SE processes [9]. Yet they remain intrusive, rigid, and 
inflexible [10], and fail to adequately support the human, 
creative, and dynamic aspects of software development. 
While more generalized automated process assistance and 
guidance for humans has been available in the form of 
process-aware information systems (PAIS) [11], this area has 
lacked satisfactory standards and SE support and often lacks 
the integration of the project and human context. Thus, such 
systems and capabilities have not been readily leveraged by 
software engineers. 
A. Our Previous Work 
To address these challenges for such human-centric SE 
processes, we created a PCSEE that we call the Context-
aware Software Engineering Environment Event-driven 
Framework (CoSEEEK) [12]. Beyond SE tool sensors and 
other contextual knowledge, it utilizes workflows to 
understand the process context. That includes knowing 
which activities a software engineer performed, which 
activity is likely currently being worked on, which activity is 
next, and associating these with SE-specific concepts such as 
167

projects, teams, persons, roles, tools, and artifacts via an 
ontology and reasoner. While various facets were 
investigated, including collaboration [13], quality integration 
[14], and others, we still faced the problem of providing an 
easy way for software engineers to access, model, and 
transform SE workflows and integrate SE concepts without 
vendor lock-in to a specific WfMS. Considering possible SE 
workflow modeling notation, the SPEM is aimed primarily at 
defining a domain-specific notation for the documentation of 
SE processes, and does not completely address issues related 
to executable SE processes so that automatic support and 
guidance for software engineers in operational activities can 
occur. On the other hand, a general workflow language 
notation such as the Business Process Model and Notation 
(BPMN) 2.0 [15], while executable, lacks the inclusion and 
semantic meaning of various SE domain-specific concepts 
and thus becomes cumbersome.  
Thus, to address the executable SE workflow language 
gap, our team created the text-based language SEWL [16] 
and previously targeted the adaptive WfMS AristaFlow [17] 
and YAWL [18] to evaluate its portability. Our previous 
work in [1] contributed various extensions to the original 
workflow 
concepts, 
including: 
a 
new 
graphical 
representation for SE-specific workflows blending BPMN 
and SPEM notation; a graphical editor for SE workflows; 
details on the model-driven generation of tailored artifacts 
that target the ontology and heterogeneous WfMS support, 
specifically the common of-the-shelf (COTS) WfMS jBPM 
[19] and Activiti [20]; and the workflow ontology generator, 
which addresses the aspect of contextual-awareness support 
for workflows in conjunction with CoSEEEK.   
B. Contribution 
This article extends our work in in [1] by expanding the 
scope of the original solution approach. It contributes an 
automated model-driven method for SE process modelers 
that incorporates a standard SE process meta-model, namely 
the UMA, thus supporting comprehensive SE process 
documentation capabilities 
while 
generating 
concrete 
enactable workflows that can be used in automated SE 
guidance support. Based on the information gleaned from the 
SE model, workflow concepts are transformed into an 
intermediate workflows language SEWL, from which further 
workflow transformations to specific WfMS can occur. An 
evaluation utilizes the EPF Composer with both existing and 
new SE process models and with Activiti and jBPM WfMS, 
the results showing the viability and practicality of the 
method for documenting an SE model with existing tooling, 
extracting SE concepts, graphically modeling SE workflows, 
transforming SE workflows to specific WfMS formats, and 
enacting SE workflows in support of contextual guidance 
capabilities for software engineers. 
The summary of the paper is as follows: the following 
section discusses related work, and Section III describes the 
solution method. Section IV then describes our realization of 
the method. Section V presents an evaluation, followed by a 
discussion and then the conclusion.  
II. 
RELATED WORK 
With regard to related work, SPEM 2.0 [21] was 
approved without supporting full process enactment. It 
proposes two possible approaches for enactment: One 
proposes a mapping to project planning tools. However, this 
does not support automated adaptation to changing project 
contexts during project execution. The other proposal is to 
use the Process Behavior package to relate SPEM process 
elements to external behavior models using proxy classes. 
Both approaches lack full workflow modeling and 
executability at the level of BPMN. 
Other work related to enactment of SPEM includes 
eXecutable SPEM (xSPEM) [21]. Process execution is 
addressed via transformation to the Business Process 
Execution Language (BPEL), while process validation is 
addressed via transformation to a Petri net in combination 
with a model checker. [22] maps SPEM to the Unified 
Modeling Language Extended Workflow Metamodel (UML-
EWM) in order to create a concretely executable workflow. 
[23] and [24]  investigate transforming SPEM to BPMN, 
while [25] maps SPEM to the XML Process Definition 
Language (XPDL). xSPIDER ML [26] is an extension 
profile of SPEM 2.0 to enable process enactment. 
The novelty of our solution method is that, in contrast to 
the above approaches, it targets a simple graphical as well as 
textual SE process language and notation for modeling, 
blending the strengths of BPMN and SPEM; it concretely 
generates executable workflows on different WfMS targets; 
and it generates an Web Ontology Language (OWL)-
compliant ontology of SE concepts for context-aware 
PCSEE tooling support. This addresses prior hindrances and 
challenges for modeling and contextually integrating SE 
workflows 
in 
SEE. 
Furthermore, 
the 
model-driven 
integration of SE process meta-models provides a way to 
support comprehensive SE process documentation while 
providing an automated method to extract enactable SE 
workflows and contextual concepts. 
III. 
SOLUTION 
This section describes our model-driven solution method 
(refer to Figure 1). The description below will refer to the 
four phases in the method shown at the top of Figure 1, 
namely model, transform, deploy, and operate.  
The basis of the solution concept is an SE workflow 
model, such as SEWL workflows which we had previously 
developed. While the method supports the use of any SE 
workflow format, SEWL was used as an intermediate 
workflow model in our realization of this method. A SEWL 
workflow is modeled, either with the graphical SEWL editor 
or a textual editor, and provided as input for our Generator. 
To transform the input, our Generator utilizes various 
adapters we created that generate appropriate workflow 
templates tailored for a specific WfMS, while concurrently 
providing OWL-DL [27] output of the semantic concept 
instances. These templates are then deployed. During 
operations, a Process Manager Service we created abstracts, 
via an interface, the WfMS-specific integration and 
interaction details for our CoSEEEK (thus CoSEEEK does 
168

not need to be a PAIS but only extend one) and the ontology 
is referenced internally during operations by CoSEEEK. 
Ontologies and semantic technology are advantageous in 
providing a taxonomy for modeled entities and their 
relations, a vocabulary, and supporting logical statements 
about entities [28]. Automated consistency checking and 
interoperability between different applications and agents 
also support SE environment concept reuse.  
A. The Model Phase 
In the model phase (see Figure 1), an SE process is 
modeled and documented based on an SE meta-model, such 
as a UMA model created using the EPF Composer. This 
model serves as an input to our Generator during the 
transform phase, which automatically generates a SE 
workflow model that maps all the correlating SE concepts to 
an intermediate SE workflow format such as SEWL. 
Alternatively, one could model or adapt the workflows 
directly in SEWL. In the process modeling phase, a graphical 
SEWL Editor assists the process modeler in creating the 
textual SEWL workflows, which maintain the essence of 
workflow 
concepts. 
Supplemental 
graphical 
diagram 
information (position, font, color, etc.) is retained in 
separately maintained diagram files, which are kept in sync 
with the SEWL workflows. Direct editing of the XML-based 
SEWL format is also possible; however, the Generator will 
remove all non-applicable elements from the graphical 
SEWL diagrams since the SEWL template XML file is 
considered the primary model source. Further details are 
provided in the next section.  
B. The Transform Phase 
As shown in Figure 1, in the transform phase SE 
workflow model inputs in a format such as SEWL are 
transformed by a Generator with a plug-in transformation 
adapter architecture to the executable workflow template 
format of a given WfMS target. An OWL adapter in the 
Generator also semantically transforms SE concepts in the 
workflow to produce an OWL-DL compliant ontology that it 
utilized for process contextual awareness by CoSEEEK.  
To exemplify what the transform phase of our method 
does, Table I shows the mapping of common SE workflow 
concepts. Here  WU stands for Work Unit and WUC for 
Work Unit Container. The primary difference between jBPM 
and Activiti concept mapping is that in Activiti loops are 
typically expressed via inclusive gateways and in jBPM via 
exclusive gateways. E.g., any concurrent tasks in an SE 
workflow 
would 
be 
modeled 
with 
the 
BPMN 
parallelGateway, 
which 
activates 
all 
branches 
simultaneously and, when merging, waits for all branches to 
complete. Most WfMS support such basic features.

To address and abstract the integration, communication, 
and coordination details of the specific WfMS, each Activity 
or Task is represented as a Service Task and, during 
generation, wrapped with code that supports the tracking or 
triggering of the start and finish of an activity or task via 
event sources and event listeners. This is done since a 
Process Manager Service abstracts the integration specifics 
of a WfMS for CoSEEEK, and a Space (a tuple space [29]) 
we 
developed 
is 
used 
to 
handle 
loosely-coupled 
communication during operation with CoSEEEK. Details on 
this are provided later in this and the next section. 
C. The Deploy Phase 
In the process deployment phase shown in Figure 1, 
workflows in a WfMS-specific format are deployed into 
their respective WfMS engine (e.g., jBPM or Activiti) and 
the workflow ontology deployed into CoSEEEK. Typically 
this implies transferring the workflow files to the expected 
locations for a given configuration.

D. The Operate Phase 
In the operate phase, a specific WfMS instantiates and 
executes workflow instances as prescribed by a Process 
Manager Service, which integrates a WfMS and abstracts its 
details and peculiarities. In our method, to support 
heterogeneous WfMS a Process Manager acts as an 
intermediary to support indirect and loosely-coupled event-
based interaction between a Service Task and the context-
aware PCSEE. In our method implementation, CoSEEEK 
uses our Space for this.  Note that the transform phase needs 
to incorporate the expected operational semantics in order to 
generate the appropriate workflows for the operational phase. 
Figure 2 provides an example of the operational 
interactions in our implementation of the method. The 
Process Manager has registered as a listener for certain 
events. CoSEEEK writes a Start Process Event into the 
Space. The Space notifies the Process Manager of this event, 
which in turn instantiates and starts a given process in the 
WfMS. For each Service Task in the workflow, a Service 
Task Start Event is sent to the Process Manager and the task 
waits until further notice. When CoSEEEK becomes aware 
of a context state change via tool sensors (e.g., a commit of 
source code was done, a test was started, or the software 
engineer manually chose a new activity) that affects this 
workflow and indicates that the current task is completed, 
CoSEEEK writes a Task Finish Event to the Space. The 
Space notifies the registered Process Manager of this event, 
and it in turn notifies the WfMS. The Service Task sends an 
End Event when it completes, and the Process Manager write 
a Node End Event in the Space. The Space notifies 
CoSEEEK of the event, which updates its state. When the 
final Service Task completes, the workflow completes, and 
the Process Manager writes an End Process Event to the 
Space, which notifies CoSEEEK, which in turn updates its 
state. As an aside, because all event history is kept in the 
Space, any CoSEEEK components or a Process Manager 
coming online after some absence (e.g., restart) can 
determine the context or catch up on any missed events.  
IV. 
REALIZATION 
This section provides details on the implementation of 
our method, the current contribution being primarily the 
integration of UMA support. To support loose-coupling with 
CoSEEEK, a service-oriented event-driven architecture was 
used in conjunction with a tuple space [29] composed on top 
of a native XML database eXist [30], and provides a Web 
Service for remote access. A Process Manager Service 
manages and abstracts the peculiarities of a WfMS, 
interacting indirectly with CoSEEEK via events in the Space.  
The Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) [31] 
and Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) [32], which 
includes ecore, were utilized by the SEWL editor. Figure 3 
shows a simplified snippet of the ecore-based metamodel. 
 
Figure 3. Simplified portion of the metamodel used with ecore. 
Transformation Adapters. The Generator and associated 
pluggable transformation adapters (SEWL, UMA, OWL, 
jBPM, Activiti, AristaFlow, YAWL) were realized primarily 
in Scala. Unique IDs were generated for every element 
transformed and its target transformed element. This permits 
a clear mapping association, which is also useful for logging. 
The ontology adapter uses the Jena framework for 
programmatic ontology access [33] to generate the ontology 
instances for phases, activities, roles, artifacts, etc. 
Figure 4 shows an example workflow snippet generated 
for a jBPM Service Task, while Figure 5 shows one for 
Activiti. For details on XML grammar of inputs or outputs, 
refer to the respective WfMS or UMA documentation.

SEWL Editor. The SEWL textual language described in 
[16] supports the modeling of SE workflow concepts that a 
SE process may have. Multi-lingual support for referencing 
the same SE concept instance in various natural languages 
(e.g., German and English) was also implemented 
previously, supporting global software development (GSD) 
processes and their documentation in multiple languages.  
The graphical notation used in the editor is extensible and 
can be adapted or "skinned" with icons to suit the 
preferences of the user, which can minimize notation 
confrontations between different user "tribes", e.g., BPMN 
purists or SPEM purists. In order to get the "best of both 
worlds", the SEWL Editor currently applied a mix of 
graphical notation as follows:  
- 
SPEM icons for all SE concepts (e.g., phase, activity, 
iteration, task, role, artifact),  
- 
BPMN icons for process notation, e.g., events, gateways, 
and connections.  
As an example, an OpenUP Inception phase workflow 
modeled in the SEWL Editor is shown in its graphical 
(Figure 9) and textual (Figure 10) notation. One can see that 
various SE concepts such as roles, phases, artifacts, 
activities, inputs, and outputs can be modeled and sequenced.

V. 
EVALUATION 
The evaluation of the solution method focuses on its 
practicality and viability. Three usage scenarios were 
evaluated, namely: a) the ability to use the method without 
utilizing any UMA model (SEWL only), b) starting with a 
new 
customized 
UMA 
model 
that 
represents 
an 
organization's own tailored SE process, and c) using an 
existing 
publicized 
UMA 
model. 
Furthermore, 
the 
performance of the method realization should be evaluated to 
determine if a model-driven XML-centric approach is 
adequate. 
As to supporting a broad modeling spectrum, the Eclipse 
Process Framework (EPF) was used as a reference for 
modeling Scrum and OpenUP. These models were 
successfully modeled and transformed. Although the entire 
OpenUP process was modeled, only portions of the Inception 
Phase are shown below due to space constraints.  
A. SEWL Non-UMA Process Model Example 
The entire OpenUP process was modeled using the 
SEWL Editor as a starting point as was seen in Figure 9, and 
the generator was executed and jBPM and Activiti outputs 
were generated. Figure 12 was rearranged by hand. A snippet 
of the corresponding generated output is shown in Figure 14 
for Activiti and in Figure 15 for jBPM. Thus processes that 
do not have or wish to use UMA can still utilize the method 
and SEWL for SE workflows. 
B. New UMA Process Model Case Study 
For this case, we started with a new EPF Composer 
project and modeled a portion of the Waterfall model based 
on Royce's original paper [40] as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 15. Example jBPM workflow snippet. 
This demonstrates that an organization's model can be 
used conveyed to UMA, and that as long as phases, 
activities, and/or tasks are modeled, default sequential 
workflows can be automatically generated from this in 
SEWL as shown in Figure 17. Here, the phases are shown as 
a sequential workflow. The Testing Phase is shown as a 
workflow of activities as shown in Figure 18. In Figure 19, 
tasks within the activity related to product assurance 
techniques specified by the Waterfall model are shown. If 
desired, workflows can then modified in the SEWL, e.g., for 
more complex non-sequential workflow models. The SEWL 
workflows were automatically transformed by the Generator 
into corresponding jBPM workflows (shown in Figures 20-
22) and Activiti workflows (shown in Figures 23-25).  
C. Existing UMA Process Model Case Study 
The published UMA process model OpenUP, shown in 
Figure 16, was modified to simulate a customization scenario 
for an organization. Here a "Review Solution" task was 
added to the "Develop Solution Increment" activity.

This was done to demonstrate that an existing 
comprehensive UMA model from the community can be 
customized and default sequential workflows automatically 
generated in SEWL. In Figure 26, the phases are shown as a 
sequential workflow. The Construction Phase was modeled 
as a workflow of activities in Figure 27. In Figure 28, the 
tasks for the activity related to product assurance techniques 
are shown. If necessary, these workflows can then be 
modified in the SEWL graphical editor to suit the needs for 
more 
complex 
non-sequential 
workflow 
models. 
Nevertheless, a starting basis is automatically provided. 
From the SEWL model, we transformed these SEWL 
workflows using the Generator into corresponding jBPM 
(Figures 29-31) and Activiti (Figures 32-34) workflows.

D. Performance 
We evaluated our model-driven solution to determine if it 
exhibits acceptable transformation performance for expected 
usage. 
1) Performance for provided SE Models: For this 
scenario we wanted to determine the performance one can 
expect for model transformation of basic and realistic SE 
process models that conform to the EPF XML Schema.  The 
configuration for these measurements consisted of an Intel 
Core i7-3740QM CPU @2,70GHz, 16 GB RAM, Windows 
7 Ultimate SP1 x64, Java 8, Scala 2.11.5.  
The 
performance 
results 
presented 
in 
Table 
II 
differentiate the two UMA SE processes Waterfall and 
OpenUP, with Waterfall being a new relatively small model 
example, and OpenUP being a comprehensive model 
example. The second major column shows the resulting file 
sizes in bytes, lines, and number of files involved for each 
of the generation steps. The major center column then 
shows 
the 
duration 
in 
milliseconds 
for 
various 
transformations. The EPF input files are the starting point, 
with the generation steps being the EPF to SEWL 
transformation (EPF->SEWL), the SEWL to diagram 
transformation (SEWL->diagram), the SEWL to jBPM 
transformation (SEWL->jBPM), and the SEWL to Activiti 
transformation (SEWL->Activiti). The maximum time 
needed was about 1 second needed to create 83 XMI 
diagram files with over 10,0000 XML lines from the input 
of 995 lines of SEWL XML. This performance seems 
acceptable for such a comprehensive SE model.

2) Plugin Performance: We compared performance of 
the various generator plugins for their different types of 
output to determine if there are significant differences or 
issues with such a plugin concept. For this, a five node 
OpenUP process sequence was provided as the input to the 
SEWL Editor, and the performance of each of the adapters 
in the Generator measured. For each round, a loop of 1000 
generations was averaged. For generating the SEWL 
template, the SEWL diagram files served as input. 
Otherwise the SEWL XML template alone was used as 
input. The configuration for these measurements consisted 
of an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU 2.26 GHz, 3 GB RAM, 
Windows XP Pro SP3, Java JDK 1.6.0-31, Scala 2.9.1, 
Activiti 5.8, jBPM 5.2, Jena 2.6.4, and Eclipse EMT 
(Helios) SR2. The performance results are presented in 
Table III, with the left column indicating the adapter 
measured, the center column the average duration, and the 
right column the size of the inputs and outputs in bytes, 
lines, and files.

Generating a SEWL template from the diagram involves 
the least amount of writing, and is thus fastest. The 
generation of SEWL diagrams in XMI format is more 
verbose in bytes and lines by at least a factor of 2, and its 
duration is correspondingly longer compared to the jBPM or 
Activiti adapters. With regard to the Ontology adapter, two 
files serve as input for generating the OWL ontology; in 
addition to the SEWL template input, the Jena Semantic 
Web framework is used to parse and create internal objects 
from the existing ontology (a comparatively large file with 
its additional 12 related remote namespace schema), then 
the relevant ontology instances are updated based on the 
SEWL file, and finally a complete OWL file that contains 
the modifications is generated. Since much more XML is 
involved in both the input parsing and generation, and the 
use of specialized semantic OWL APIs, here the overall 
performance for generating semantic workflow context 
concepts is noticeable. 
Because the RDF and OWL-DL XML formats are 
standardized, possible optimization strategies include 
partitioning the ontology to only those areas applicable for 
workflow ontology concepts, rather than the total ontology. 
Another possibility is the use of solid state disks on the 
devices involved in the ontology generation, e.g., by placing 
the adapter behind a web service. 
In summary, the performance of the generators appears 
satisfactory for typical SE process transformation.

VI. 
DISCUSSION 
While there is potential for further automation of SE 
processes and automated guidance support, a number of 
practical hindrances remain.  
In the past, since SE process documentation lacked 
contextually adapted and WfMS supported workflows, it has 
often seemed not to be operationally relevant, but rather 
something relatively abstract. It might serve to satisfy the 
appearance of the existence of a disciplined and professional 
method for approaching the software engineering work, with 
no real way to monitor actual usage or compliance with it. 
Thus, for most of the actors involved in using the 
documentation of SE processes, the documented workflows 
appear not to add significant value and most of the work is 
done without referring to the SE process documentation with 
any of its specified abstract workflows. Perhaps the swing in 
prior decades to overly documented und irrelevant SE 
processes caused an understandable and reactionary agile 
movement, as codified in the Agile Manifesto [1], to 
minimize tools and documentation. 
However, if SE process documentation could include 
operationally concrete and WfMS-enactable workflows that 
provide contextually relevant guidance, and these workflows 
involved the actual tools and artifacts used and were tied in 
to the SE process documentation as well, then it would bring 
"life" to the relatively "dead" SE process documentation, 
since contextually adapted workflows would be mostly 
relevant and helpful to the software engineers in their actual 
work context. They would no longer have the hurdle of 
manually finding their current context in the abstract and 
perhaps quite comprehensive SE process documentation, and 
then manually determining the workflow portions they are 
supposed to follow and keep jumping from their work 
context to their process documentation context.  
Activities and processes are an inherent part of SE and 
will continue to be used to accomplish SE work, be they 
explicit and documented or implicit and undocumented. As 
automation and intelligence in SE environments increases, a 
middle-ground may be found between these two extremes, so 
that the benefits that other domains have reaped from WfMS 
support for human-centric and hybrid human and automated 
workflows can be better integrated and leveraged in the SE 
landscape. This will involve documentation and workflow 
modeling, and a model-driven approach can automate many 
of the aspects in order to minimize the effort involved for 
software engineers. 
The SE environment, tooling, and process area has seen 
relatively little standardization for various reasons. Efforts to 
better integrate the heterogeneous SE tooling landscape in a 
vendor-neutral manner, such as the semantic services 
approach of Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration 
(OSLC) project, seem to have fizzled at the moment for all 
practical purposes. As tools continue to change, keeping the 
data models and integrations updated seems to involve 
significant effort without significant incentives. Future 
approaches may move more tooling to the cloud, enabling 
better context-aware SE integration. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This article contributed a practical model-driven 
methodology that supports the usage and transformation of 
software engineering process documentation to workflows 
executable in modern workflow management systems. The 
method can utilize comprehensive SE process documentation 
meta-models and automatically extract incorporated SE 
concepts and workflow models to an intermediate SE 
workflow format such as the Software Engineering 
Workflow Language (SEWL). These workflows can 
optionally be edited in a common SE format that is aware of 
SE process and environment concepts and can then 
transformed into various enactable WfMS formats and 
ontological concepts for context-aware support. 
Automated workflow guidance for SE projects remains a 
challenge, and current SE process meta-models have hitherto 
not integrated support for intricate and enactable workflow 
modeling capabilities. With our practical model-driven 
method we showed that, beginning with only a rudimentary 
process documentation of a set of SE concepts conformant to 
some SE process meta-model such as the UMA, actually 
enactable workflows can be automatically generated for 
various common WfMS. Our method enables the utilization 
of currently available SE process documentation tooling such 
as the EPF Composer, without needing to deal with separate 
manual process modeling techniques for a vendor-specific 
WfMS due to our model-driven adapters. Such generated 
sequential workflows extracted and transformed from some 
SE process documentation can provide a starting point for 
more intricate operational SE workflow modeling in, for 
instance, our SEWL editor, should certain workflows be 
more complex or require branches or loops. These can be 
readily adjusted either with the SEWL graphical editor or 
directly in the SEWL text-based model, and then WfMS-
specific workflows can be automatically generated. 
This solution method provides an easy to use graphical 
modeling capability for executable SE workflows that can 
execute on commonly available WfMS, while retaining SE 
semantic information in a separate OWL file for contextually 
aware PCSEEs. The evaluation results show that such a 
model-based method for transforming SE workflows to 
common WfMS is both feasible and practical.  
Future work includes case studies with industry partners 
in live settings as well as more comprehensive utilization of 
the ontological concepts extractable from such UMA-based 
models with those of CoSEEEK. Also, bidirectional 
workflow transformation support between SEWL and an 
engine-specific workflow format would allow editing in the 
workflow editor of choice. This entails providing reverse 
transformation 
support 
for 
engine-specific 
workflow 
templates, enabling engine-specific usage of features and 
editing capabilities via workflow engine-specific editors. For 
instance, changes made to jBPM and Activiti workflows 
could be automatically reflected in a SEWL template.
