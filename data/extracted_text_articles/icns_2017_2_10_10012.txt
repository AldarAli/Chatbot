Abstract—In this paper we compare the main algorithms used 
for bandwidth allocation in Ethernet Passive Optical Networks 
(EPON): Interleaved Polling with Adaptive Cycle (IPACT), 
Constant Cycle Time (CCT) and Static Bandwidth Allocation 
for High Priority Services (SBAHPS) algorithms. Computer 
simulations are executed to reproduce the behavior of these 
methods using powerful software tools. Some changes in the 
computational procedures have also been implemented. The 
ICCT (Improved CCT) and SBAHPS algorithms showed the 
best results.  
Keywords-EPON; bandwidth allocation;resource efficiency.

INTRODUCTION 
Traffic in telecommunication networks grows 
steadily because of data-intensive applications and services. 
To tackle this fact, EPONs have gained popularity as a 
suitable infrastructure to support such huge traffic in the 
access segment. In EPONs several Optical Network Units 
(ONUs) share a common upstream channel for transmission. 
The bandwidth must be dynamically allocated among 
multiple ONUs to achieve an efficient use of resources.  
Allocation algorithms take into account the instantaneous 
bandwidth demand and 
Quality of Service (QoS) 
requirements. 
Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) is an active 
field of research [1], and many different approaches have 
been proposed [2]-[12]. In this paper, we compare the main 
algorithms for bandwidth allocation for data transmission 
upstream from multiple ONUs to the Optical Line 
Termination (OLT) in EPONs [1], such as: IPACT, CCT 
and SBAHPS. Several indicators on efficiency and fair 
utilization of the EPON upstream bandwidth, while 
supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of 
different 
traffic 
classes, 
are 
calculated. 
Several 
modifications in the computational procedures have also 
been carried out. The software simulation tools have been 
developed using Mathworks Matlab software.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in 
Section 2, we discuss recent literature on DBA for EPONs, 
Section 3 describe the algorithms to be compared, Sections 
4 and 5 contain the results and discussion. We end with 
some conclusions and explain some future works. 
II. 
STATE OF ART 
There are research papers that apply techniques for 
DBA in EPON networks. In [3], the authors examine 
Passive Optical Networks (PON) architectures and DBA 
algorithms. The main branches of their classification for 
DBA methods are: grant sizing, grant scheduling, and 
optical network unit queue scheduling. They examine the 
topics of QoS support, as well as fair bandwidth allocation. 
The results are summarized and explicitly point to posible 
future avenues of research. In [4], an enhanced QoS-based 
dynamic bandwidth allocation (EQDBA) mechanism is 
proposed which incorporates with a prediction-based fair 
excessive bandwidth allocation (PFEBA) scheme to support 
differential traffic class in EPON. The proposed EQDBA 
mechanism divides a frame into two parts; one is the high 
priority traffic, which is always assigned in the fixed 
location of the frame to minimize the delay variation. The 
other kind of traffic, to solve the idle period problem, is 
dynamically adjusted in the transmission order according to 
an unstable degree list. The simulation results show that the 
proposed mechanism outperforms the PFEBA and QDBA 
mechanisms in terms of average end-to-end delay and high 
priority traffic delay to ensure QoS. In [6], the authors 
present a survey of the state of the art DBA algorithms for 
EPONs. They explain the main concepts and issues related 
to DBA in EPON systems.  This paper justifies why IPACT, 
CCT and SBAHPS are the most suitable DBA algorithms. 
In [7], the authors  show  the differences between EPON 
and GPON (such as: bandwidth utilization, delay, and jitter) 
by means of simulations for the two standards.  They take 
into account the evolution of both technologies to their next-
generation counterparts with a bit rate of 10 Gbps and 
analyze the implications for the DBA. The authors propose 
a new GPON DBA method to study the GPON 
performance. It is shown that the length of the polling cycle 
is a key issue for the DBA within the two standards. Minor 
differences regarding DBA for current and next-generation 
PONs were also detected. In [12], the author emulates a 
10Gbps next generation EPON network, which transmits 
voice, video and data packets,  using  the DBA-MAX, 
DBA-LINEAR 
and 
DBA-GATED 
algorithms. 
The 
performance is compared studying the variations of the 
average delay and the throughput with the traffic load. In 
[11], the authors provide a classification and a detailed 
comparison for a large number of DBA algorithms with 
respect to time delay and throughput parameters as 
performance indicators. The study explains that IPACT 
WITH CBR, UDBA, IPACT with two stages and CPBA 
algorithms show good results.

There are also a few studies regarding IPACT and 
its variances. Some of  them  are: 
 
[8], where the authors propose a new DBA algorithm. 
The method provides constant and predictable average 
packet delay and minimizes the delay variation for the 
high and medium priority traffic, keeping the packet 
loss rate under control. 
 
[9], where the authors describe an improved weighted 
interleaved polling with adaptive cycle time (IW-
IPACT) algorithm according to the QoS requirement 
for different kinds of traffic. Strict priority scheduling 
was applied to the expedited forwarding services and, 
the weighted fair queuing scheduling was used for the 
rest of the services. 
 
[10], where the authors present a dynamic bandwidth 
allocation model. They propose a local bandwidth 
allocation algorithm based on a bargain—bargain 
approach. Reordering the delivery date of each packet 
after bargaining it according to its user level, delay and 
size. The model improves the traditional IPACT 
algorithm which establishes the delivery date of each 
packet in the order of polling. The results show that the 
proposed model can effectively minimize the Unused 
Slot Remainder (USR), and improves bandwidth 
allocation efficiency. 
As a novelty, we analyze the CCT algorithm, and 
carry out specific variations in the SBAHPS and IPACT 
methods. We also study among other parameters: the 
average cycle times, the cycle time standard deviation and 
the waste of channel capacity for the high and low priority 
traffics. These experiments (algorithms and parameters) 
have been chosen because IPACT, CCT and SBAHPS 
algorithms are considered as the most efficient methods in 
the scientific bibliography, and because these parameters 
allow  to evaluate precisely the behavior of them. 
III. 
BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION FOR UPSTREAM 
DATA TRANSMISSION 
This section describes the main DBA algorithms  
that have been simulated: IPACT, CCT and SBAHPS 
methods. Simulation results are presented  in Section 4.  
In general, the OLT allocates the size of 
transmission windows for each ONU using the GATE 
message. This allocation is based on the information 
received from ONUs in the REPORT message. 
A. Interleaved Polling with Adaptive Cycle 
The OLT polls the ONUs individually and issues 
grants to them in a round-robin fashion [2]. At the end of a 
transmission window, an ONU reports its queue sizes. The 
OLT employes this data to establish the next granted 
transmission window. The knowledge of the distance 
between OLT and ONUs (d) allows the OLT to schedule 
transmission windows so that packages from different 
ONUs do not overlap in time.  
The OLT controls and allocates a transmission 
window for each ONU at levels below an established 
maximum value (TMax) according to the Service Level 
Agreement (SLA). If the transmission window requested by 
an ONU is lower than TMax, the OLT will allocate this 
value to the ONU. If not, the OLT will allocate TMax as 
transmission window size. 
B. Constant Cycle Time 
This algorithm does not carry out a sequential pool 
of ONUs. The transmissions from each ONUs are 
undertaken in a cyclical manner. Once the transmission in 
the cycle TCyclej is finished, each ONU will have sent a 
REPORT message with the request related to the 
transmission window for the cycle TCyclej+2. This method 
ignores the requested window size from each ONU and 
always grants the estimated TMax in a cycle as window size. 
The main disadvantage of this algorithm is  that the cycle 
time is not used efficiently by those ONU with little 
information to tranmit. 
 
TMaxin cycle j+2 is defined as: 
 
TMaxin cycle j+2 =∑
(ܶܥݕ݈ܿ݁௝௞ − ܶܣݑݐ݋௝௞)௞ୀே
௞ୀଵ
/N       (1) 
 
Where: 
 
TCyclej: Time needed by the ONUs to transmit the 
granted length of data together with their associated 
guard intervals in the cycle j. 
 
TAuto: Time required to detect newly-connected ONUs 
and handle the round-trip delay and MAC address of 
ONUs in the cycle j. 
We suggest raising the efficiency in the use of 
resources employing the ICCT algorithm, which is 
based on the following premises: 
- 
The OLT summarizes the unused transmission 
window time in cycle j (UTij) for all ONUs with   a  
window size lower than TMax, The OLT grants 
this calculated value(tre-assignedj) to those ONUs that 
have requested a  window higher than TMax.(Pj).

∑

೔సభ
௉ೕ
                  (2) 
- 
In the event that all ONUs request a window size 
higher than TMax., the allocations are equitably 
distributed in a manner similar to the CCT 
algorithm. 
C. Static Bandwidth Allocation for High Priority Services 
In relation to the SBAHPS method, based on the 
investigation [5], we suggest prioritizing delay-sensitive 
traffic (IP telephony, video-streaming, etc) by reserving a 
specific time slot. This time slot should be proportional to 
the allocated transmission window for each ONU. This 
procedure works similarly to the IPACT algorithm but 
booking a specific time slot for the high priority traffic in

each ONU. However, this particular slot can be used  
inefficiently by an ONU has not enough traffic to fill it 
completely. 
IV.

The simulation environment should be suitable for 
the most usual applications. Its requirements are:

bits/second) using 1490 nm wavelength for downstream 
and 1310 nm for upstream, with 1550 nm reserved for 
additional services.  This network has a 1:32 split ratio. 
 
ONUs are located at a distance of d km from the OLT. 
 
The network is in a stable condition at the simulation 
time.  


Poisson distribution, which has a mean arrival rate of λi 
packages every second. A package requires a mean 
service timeE(X). ONUi has a traffic load i.

Figure 1 shows that there is not a clear distinction 
between the average cycle times for high and low priority 
traffic when the relation between N and M parameters is 1. 
Figure 2 shows the progressive growth of the cycle time 
standard deviation when the total traffic, Total, increases. 
Figure 3 displays how the cycle time standard deviation 
increases as the number of ONUs raises, this fact is 
particularly relevant for high traffic demands (i.e., in Total = 
95% , (σ൫ܶ௖௜௖௟௢

The results show that IPACT algorithm carries out 
an efficient use of resources; however, is very sensitive to 
fast traffic changes or unstable traffic flows.

In Figure 5, it can be noted that the package

In Figures 7, 8, and 9, it can be noted that the 
algorithm works properly, the high priority traffic is 
adequately prioritized and there is no waste in the allocated 
time. However, the low traffic data stored in the buffer 
increases as the total traffic load raises, although lower in 
magnitude than in the CCT algorithm. Figure 10 shows the 
average cycle time for several values of M and HP = 0.1. It 
should be noted that a decrease in the number of ONUs 
transmitting low priority data traffic implies a considerable 
increase in the average cycle time for this kind of traffic. 
Figure 11 shows that the low traffic stored in the buffer 
increases as the total load traffic grows for all M values. 
Figure 7.  ICCT algorithm: E(TCycleHP), E(TCycleLP) in microseconds as 
a function of Total with HP = 0.1 [1]. 
The results show that ICCT method prioritizes the 
high priority traffic with an  insignificant impact on  the low 
priority traffic delay. However, the  low priority traffic 
stored in the buffer  increases as the total traffic flow grows.

Figure 12 shows that the growth of the average 
cycle time is connected to the increase of the total traffic 
load. In Figures 13 and 14, it can be noted that the high 
priority data traffic stored in the buffer is much higher than 
the low priority traffic. There is not a significant waste of 
reserved capacity. This waste is slightly decreased if the 
total traffic increases.  
The results show that the SBAHPS algorithm gets 
suitable constant cycle times and low priority buffered 
traffic flows. However, it has an inefficient bandwidth usage 
for the high priority traffic.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
We have analyzed the main algorithms utilized for 
the bandwidth allocation in EPON:  IPACT, CCT and 
SBAHPS  methods. Several computer simulations were 
carried out to reproduce the behavior of these algorithms 
and study their characteristics.  
IPACT algorithm could be easily implemented and 
showed a good performance.  However, due to the impact 
on the time-length cycle variations,  caused by requests of 
big transmission windows from any ONU, it was difficult to 
achieve a minimum guarantee quality service when a

specific delay was required (audio streaming, VoIP, video 
conference, etc.). The ICCT algorithm, which we use 
instead of the CCT method to raise the efficiency in the use 
of resources, had an important computational complexity. 
However, its capability to assign unused capacity 
intransmission windows, caused that the resources were 
more efficiently used for the data transmission upstream. 
The SBAHPS algorithm booked a transmission time for the 
high priority traffic, which was proportional to the allocated 
window for the rest of traffic. The control performed with 
the aim of limiting the maximum transmission window in 
each ONU, allowed to guarantee a QoS. Additionally,  its 
configuration could be adapted to work in a similar way to 
IPACT and ICCT algorithms. 
Our future research will build a proof of concept 
based on the simulation, which will test several real 
scenarios.
