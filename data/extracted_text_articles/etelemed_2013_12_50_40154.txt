Abstract—Numerous telecare interventions and technologies 
are used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This 
systematic 
review 
examines 
the 
different 
telecare 
interventions implemented, the technologies used, as well as 
their associated outcomes. Such a synthesis aims at 
optimizing telecare use for diabetic patients and informing 
decision makers on technology selection and the impacts 
that can be expected with telecare use. Following a 
systematic, comprehensive search of databases, 2,139 
qualitative and quantitative studies were initially selected; 
after careful review and screening, 50 studies were coded 
and analyzed. The results of this review will be used by 
healthcare professionals, organizations and patient support 
groups to tailor their policies with regards to the choice, 
planning, diffusion and monitoring of telecare interventions 
and the technologies implemented to care for patients with 
diabetes.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The use of telecare technologies (TT) seems to hold 
promise for chronic care management since it “produces 
accurate and reliable data, empowers patients, influences 
their attitudes and behaviors, and potentially improves 
their medical conditions [1].” However, there is still a 
lack of evidence on its clinical effects, cost effectiveness, 
and impacts on service utilization [1]. The large 
prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the 
patient population and the impetus for quality of care—
including monitoring, self-care and close follow-up—are 
creating a need for the development and use of TT. 
However, given the large variety of TT currently 
available and the diversity of interventions, ranging from 
condition monitoring to instant health diagnoses, it is 
difficult to fully grasp the actual impacts of telecare. 
There have been numerous reports of interventions 
designed to improve the care of patients with diabetes, 
but their effectiveness is unclear. It is now essential to 
assess the overall effectiveness and efficacy of telecare in 
the care of patients with T2DM and to verify whether all 
TT are beneficial. There is also a need to assess the 
impact of telecare on adherence to guidelines, enhanced 
monitoring, fewer treatment errors, and a reduction of 
overall health care system costs for patients with T2DM. 
This paper therefore presents an ongoing mixed 
systematic review of telecare interventions and the 
technologies used in diabetic care. The specific 
objectives of this review are: (1) to provide a typology of 
the different telecare interventions and technologies used 
and (2) to determine the outcomes, both positive and 
negative, of telecare used in the context of T2DM.  
 
II. 
METHODS 
 
A mixed-method systematic review was used to integrate 
results from both qualitative and quantitative studies [2]. 
Through a review of evidence from both qualitative and 
quantitative studies, disparate data were synthesized in 
order to better understand complex phenomena such as 
the adoption of innovations [2-5]. This mixed review 
followed recognized standards for systematic reviews 
[6,7] and is presented according to PRISMA criteria [14]: 
(1) eligibility criteria; (2) information source and search 
strategy; (3) study selection; (4) data collection process 
and synthesis of results; and (5) critical appraisal.  
The studies that met the inclusion criteria were 
evaluation studies using a quantitative, qualitative or 
mixed-method study design. We did not a priori exclude 
specific study designs, but quantitative and/or qualitative 
results had to be available. The review considered all 
types of telecare interventions, including telemonitoring, 
telediagnosis, 
teleconsultation 
and 
all 
types 
of 
technologies, including internet and smart phone use. 
Articles were excluded if they focused solely on 
describing a telecare intervention or a technology.  
The review is based on a systematic, comprehensive 
search of six databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, ISI 
Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus. It considered 
articles in English or French, published or in press 
between January 2000 and March 2011. The literature 
search was performed by a librarian and validated by a 
researcher. The following sets of keywords and terms 
were searched in combination: Telecare Technologies:

Dependent, diabet* or MODY OR NIDDM OR T2DM 
OR IDDM). We hand-searched the reference lists of all 
the selected references. EndNote software was used to 
manage the references and eliminate duplications.  
Studies 
were 
independently 
selected 
by 
two 
researchers. First, references were selected based on title 
and abstract according to the review study’s inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. When there was any doubt, the 
study was provisionally included for consideration on the 
basis of a reading of the full text. The second round of 
selection was based on the full texts of the papers. Any 
disagreement was resolved through consensus. In a few 
cases, disagreements were arbitrated by two other 
researchers; a study was included only when these two 
researchers agreed that the study was eligible. Kappa 
scores were calculated at each stage.  
Data extraction from the selected studies was 
performed independently by two researchers using a 
standardized form that included: nature of the telecare 
intervention, technology characteristics, country, year, 
author, type of study (quantitative, qualitative or mixed), 
study design, type of participants, region (rural/urban), 
and all outcomes. The impacts of telecare on each 
outcome were coded narratively (positive impact, 
negative impact, no impact, not reported). Once again, 
any outstanding disagreement on data extraction was 
resolved through consensus by two other researchers. 
We first conducted a narrative synthesis of the studies 
[8,9] using the validated methodological guide for 
narrative syntheses in order to ensure that the synthesis 
would be transparent and reproducible [8,9]. The 
narrative synthesis was performed by two of the 
researchers and validated by two others. This allowed us, 
first, to develop a typology of telecare by creating 
homogeneous sub-groups of telecare interventions and 
technologies that go beyond their denomination by the 
study’s author, and second, to narratively analyze the 
results for each outcome. We grouped them into several 
categories: health outcomes, other patients’ outcomes, 
quality of care, health service use-cost-productivity and 
satisfaction.  
The methodological quality of the studies was 
assessed independently by two researchers. As the 
methods of the included studies were disparate—
qualitative, quantitative or mixed—, we used all nine of 
the criteria from a quality assessment tool developed for 
systematic reviews of disparate data [10]. Any 
discrepancies were resolved through consensus.  
 
III. 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
 
The primary search yielded 2,133 references. Another 6 
references were found by searching the reference lists of 
the retrieved articles [11]. Applying the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, 1,945 references were excluded on the 
basis of the title and abstract (Kappa: 0.89) and 144 more 
were excluded on the basis of the full text (Kappa: 0.93). 
The final sample consisted of 50 articles. 
 
A. Characteristics of the Selected Studies1  
 
Twenty-five studies were conducted in North America: 
USA (23 studies) and Canada (2). The remaining studies 
were conducted in Asia (15) and Europe (7). In addition, 
three studies were conducted in multiple countries. The 
studies used quantitative designs (41), including 
randomized controlled trials (27), non-randomized 
controlled trials (5), before-after designs (6), time series 
(1); qualitative designs (1), or mixed-method designs (8). 
The studies involved solely patients (35), solely 
healthcare professionals (2) or a combination of patients 
and professionals (13).  
 
B. Typology of telecare interventions and technologies 
 
With regard to the nature of the telecare interventions, 
the synthesis of the literature revealed 23 articles on 
simple telecare interventions. Telemonitoring represented 
the vast majority of this group (17 studies). In addition, 
27 articles referred to complex telecare interventions. 
Complex interventions were mainly a combination of 
telemonitoring 
with 
telediagnosis/consultation 
(10 
studies) or with e-learning (10 studies). 
 
C. Technologies used 
 
With regard to the technology used, half of the studies 
used a single technology (25 studies). The two most used 
TT used on its own were distant direct transmission (9 
studies) and smart phone/personal digital assistant (PDA) 
(7 studies).  The other technologies used in isolation 
were: teleconference, website/internet and pager. The 
other half of the studies were on multiple technologies 
used in combination, mainly a combination of smart 
phone/PDA and web site/internet (11 studies).

Outcomes of telecare 
 
A variety of outcomes were studied (Table 2). We 
grouped them according to five categories: health 
outcomes, other patients’ outcomes, quality of care, 
health service use-cost-productivity and satisfaction 
(clinicians’ and patients’). Generally speaking, telecare 
produces positive results for most of the outcomes.

Critical appraisal 
 
Our critical appraisal reveals that their abstracts, 
introductions and aims were generally well written 
(coded as good or fair in all cases). The research methods 
used were robust most of the time. However, weaknesses 
were observed in the descriptions of the methods, 
particularly in terms of a lack of detailed information on 
the data collected, on the sampling methods used and the 
data analysis. Despite these weaknesses, the critical 
appraisal indicates that the extant research findings and 
results are credible and generalizable; these results 
typically have practical implications. A sensitivity 
analysis [6] was conducted to determine whether the 
decision to include all the studies, independent of their 
overall quality, had any effect on the results of the 
review. Even when we excluded the only article with at 
least one bad quality indicator, the findings of this review 
remain robust.  
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Considering the great variety of telecare interventions 
and technologies and the fact that each outcome is poorly 
understood, this article clarifies the nature of the different 
telecare interventions implemented, the technologies 
used per se, and the associated outcomes. The most 
common telecare interventions are remote monitoring, 
which is sometimes combined with other types of 
interventions such as telediagnosis/consultation or e-
learning. These interventions are enabled by a variety of 
technologies. Half of the interventions reported the use of 
a single technology (mainly direct transmission), while 
the others reported use of a mix of technologies. 
Based on our preliminary results, our systematic 
review reveals that, overall, the use of telecare has 
positive outcomes such as improved health status, 
increased quality of care, decreased health service use or 
cost, increased satisfaction and increased patient 
knowledge. In particular, the use of TT to monitor 
patients with diabetes allows for more flexibility and 
more frequent monitoring. In their 12-month study of 
veterans with diabetes, Chumbler et al [12] found that the 
226

number of admissions and bed days of care decreased by 
half in the group receiving less intensive but daily 
monitoring, whereas it doubled in the more intensive 
monitoring group. They suggest that “less intensive 
assessments have a greater effect on reducing service use 
than less frequent but more intensive evaluations” 
(p.155). From this perspective, our review shows that 
telecare improves chronic disease management for 
patients with diabetes and may play a critical role in 
delivering appropriate individualized and flexible care 
for patients with diabetes. Telecare is thus a promising 
solution in the current search for patient-centered care 
[13]. It has been shown that interventions targeting 
healthcare 
professionals, 
such 
as 
clinical 
and 
organizational interventions that facilitate structured and 
regular reviews of patients, are effective in improving the 
process of care [14]. Also, interventions targeting the 
patients themselves, such as educational and behavioral 
interventions, produce better diabetes self-management 
and patient outcomes [15]. 
On the other hand, our typology highlighted the 
variety of telecare interventions and technologies 
currently used to improve clinical processes and patient 
outcomes. Our results suggest that no given intervention 
or technology is clearly superior. Research results 
indicate that there is no “one size fits all” solution. 
Healthcare clinicians and managers need to carefully 
select the type of TT that will be most appropriate, based 
on the needs of their organizations and clienteles. 
Our results may serve to identify the characteristics 
and impacts of telecare, optimize telecare use, and inform 
decision makers on telecare interventions and technology 
selection and the impacts they can expect from telecare 
use.
