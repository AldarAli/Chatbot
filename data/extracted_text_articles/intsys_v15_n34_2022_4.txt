Abstract—This paper presents extended research and current
status on a practical solution for geoscientiﬁc inventories based
on conceptual contextualisation. The goal of this research is
the creation and further development of a practical Holocene-
prehistoric
inventory
of
worldwide
volcanological
features
groups,
coherently
integrating
multi-disciplinary
conceptual
knowledge.
The
focus
is
a
sustainable
multi-disciplinary
integration of knowledge contexts, especially from prehistory and
archaeology, which further enables coherent multi-disciplinary
conceptual
knowledge
contextualisation
and
georeferenced
symbolic representation. This paper provides the status of
conceptual knowledge facets, implementations and realisations
of the coherent conceptual knowledge and the methodological
component integration. The resulting inventory is illustrated
by resulting excerpts of major volcanological features groups
based on a conceptual knowledge result matrix. Future research
will address the resulting Holocene-prehistoric inventory of
worldwide volcanological feature groups, continuous development
of resources and integration and coherent multi-disciplinary
conceptual knowledge contextualisation with prehistorical and
archaeological knowledge resources for creation of new insight.

I.
INTRODUCTION
This paper is an extended and updated presentation of the
research based on the publication and presentation at the
GEOProcessing 2022 conference in Porto, Portugal [1]. Due
to a number of recent requests for the created inventory,
we take the chance that this extended paper can concentrate
on the practical inventory, showing a wider range of result
groups based on practical conceptual facets used for on-
demand contextualisation and symbolic representation.
The corresponding procedural component framework imple-
mentation and realisation for creation of a multi-disciplinary
coherent conceptual knowledge-based Holocene-prehistoric in-
ventory of volcanological features groups is described in
detail [2] along with the overall frame [3] and importance
of information science methods and structures [4]. Faceting
aspects employing procedural components is provided with an
extended view on implementations [5].
The goal of this research is the creation and further de-
velopment of a practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory of
worldwide volcanological features groups, integrating arbitrary
coherent conceptual knowledge. The target is a sustainable
multi-disciplinary integration of knowledge contexts, espe-
cially from prehistory and archaeology, which further enables
a coherent conceptual knowledge contextualisation and geo-
referenced symbolic representation. The approach conforms
with information science fundaments and universal knowledge,
which enable an integration of the required components from
methodologies to realisations for knowledge representations of
realia and abstract contexts [6], considering that many facets
of knowledge, including prehistory, need to be continuously
acquired and reviewed [7]. Creating contextualisation requires
to coherently integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge and to
enable symbolic representations, e.g., integrating chorological
and chronological contexts. Realisations need to integrate a
wide range of components as required from participating dis-
ciplines, e.g., for dynamical processing, geoprocessing, spatial
contextualisation. Implementation and realisation based on
the methodology of coherent conceptual knowledge contex-
tualisation requires the integration of standardised, modular
components required for task within participating disciplines.
This research employs knowledge resources, data sources,
and Points of Interest (PoI), especially Knowledge Resources
(KR) focussing on volcanological features, prehistory, and
archaeology.
Therefore, two major reference implementations were de-
ployed for implementation, realisation, and continuous further
development: The Conceptual Knowledge Reference Imple-
mentation (CKRI) [8] and the Component Reference Imple-
mentations (CRI) framework [9]. The reference implementa-
tions were created with coherent conceptual knowledge and
sustainable standardised components in mind.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
presents the major reference implementations. Section III
presents the methodological implementation and realisation
with the CKRI references and the respective component in-
tegration for this research. Section IV shows the resulting
inventory, the knowledge integration results, and excerpts of
the created volcanological features groups of the inventory.
Section V provides a compact discussion of the results regard-
ing the coherent conceptual knowledge integration. Section VI
summarises lessons learned, conclusions, and future work.

MAJOR REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS
The coherent knowledge resources and the practical real-
isation are fully based on the main implementations of the
prehistory-protohistory and archaeology Conceptual Knowl-
edge Reference Implementation (CKRI) [8] and the Com-
ponent Reference Implementations (CRI) framework [9].
CKRI provides the knowledge framework, including multi-
disciplinary contexts of natural sciences and humanities [10].
CRI provides the required component groups and components

for the implementation and realisation of all the procedural
modules. The component and workﬂow procedure related
research for this inventory is in focus of multi-disciplinary
research groups and matter to be reported in separate publica-
tions. Many aspects of knowledge [11], including meaning,
can be described using knowledge complements supporting
a modern deﬁnition of knowledge [12] and subsequent com-
ponent instrumentation, e.g., considering factual, conceptual,
procedural, metacognitive, and structural knowledge.
Especially, conceptual knowledge can relate to any of fac-
tual, conceptual, procedural, and structural knowledge. Knowl-
edge complements are a means of understanding and tar-
geting new insight, e.g., enabling advanced contextualisation,
integration, analysis, synthesis, innovation, prospection, and
documentation. Regarding knowledge, it should be taken for
granted, that scientiﬁc members of any disciplines nowerdays
continuously practice and train themselves in development and
practical employment of methods, algorithms, and components
as required by their disciplines and keep track with how
to integrate methods. All the components are in continuous
development by the respective disciplines themselves.
The reference implementations are part of the developments
and provide sustainable, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient fundaments for
solutions targeting the creation of coherent multi-disciplinary
conceptual knowledge contextualisation.
III.
METHODOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND
REALISATION
Implementation and realisation are based on the CKRI
reference implementation [8], and respective contextualisation.
Components outside the core scope of this knowledge fo-
cussed geoscientiﬁc, prehistoric, and archaeological research
are employed and can be extended via the CRI frame reference
implementations [9]. Both provide sustainable fundaments for
highest levels of reproducibility and standardisation.
A. Resulting coherent conceptual knowledge implementation
Universally consistent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowl-
edge is based on the Conceptual Knowledge Reference Im-
plementation (CKRI) [8] and implemented via UDC code
references for demonstration, spanning the main tables [13]
shown in Table I and major discipline knowledge, ‘natural

The ten major CRI component groups were integrated for
the implementation and realisation of the practical Holocene-
prehistoric inventory of volcanological features groups.
In summary, with this short excursus on procedural compo-
nents here, the main component groups are focussing on:
1)
Conceptual knowledge frameworks.
2)
Conceptual knowledge base.
3)
Integration of scientiﬁc reference frameworks.
4)
Formalisation.
5)
Methodologies and workﬂows integration.
6)
Prehistory Knowledge Resources.
7)
Natural Sciences Knowledge Resources.
8)
Inherent representation groups.
9)
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation.
10)
Structures and symbolic representation.
Focus is on the contextualisation and conceptual knowledge
framework, its development, and its ﬂexibility of integration
with advanced components. All component groups are sup-
porting conceptual knowledge and respective faceting.
Relevant pre-existing and ongoing component developments
addressing knowledge with multi-disciplinary KR have been
summarised [15]. Integration of components and procedural
realisations are out of scope here but subject of research
in respective ﬁelds. Procedural realisations will therefore be
published separately.
The exact components for the implementation and reali-
sation of the practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory of vol-
canological features groups are given in the next sections.

The following sections provide illustrative object entity
examples of the new practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory
of volcanological features groups facets as implemented and
realised integrating the aforementioned reference implementa-
tions. Figure V shows an excerpt of respective features groups

Context example references for the Holocene-prehistoric
Inventory of volcanological features groups are Prehistoric
Volcanic Activity (PVA) for all volcanological features groups.
These features groups facets provide a base for the conceptual
knowledge facets. The context examples will be discussed in
more detail the following, presenting the result matrix of facets
and contexts.
A. Resulting coherent conceptual knowledge facets integration
The coherent conceptual knowledge integration enables
facet creation and multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge
integration. This case demonstrates an integration of Holocene-
prehistoric volcanological features, geoscientiﬁc knowledge,
and spatial knowledge. Any further knowledge can be co-
herently integrated, e.g., prehistoric and archaeological knowl-
edge.
Table VI shows an excerpt of the result matrix of Holocene-
prehistoric volcanological features groups and respective
facets, namely conceptual knowledge, chronology, and chorol-
ogy. The result matrix includes conceptual knowledge view
groups [16] based on CKRI references [8], factual knowledge
from the Knowledge Resources objects, and respective country
codes.
Context example references for the features groups facets
show Prehistoric Volcanic Activity (PVA), Historic Volcanic
Activity (HVA), and Continued Volcanic Activity (CVA), e.g.,
latent volcanic activity. PVA are consequence of the Holocene-
prehistoric target for all objects in the resulting volcanological
features groups. Cases for which further facts are holding
true can also allow past-prehistoric contextualisation, e.g., with
HVA and CVA. Multi-disciplinary contextualisation further
depends on the availability of respective factual knowledge,
e.g., via The Prehistory and Archaeology Knowledge Archive
(PAKA) [17]. Any case can be dynamically contextualised with
multi-disciplinary knowledge, especially from prehistory and
archaeology, e.g., referring to prehistoric object properties and
excavation results and targeting new insight from geoscientiﬁc
and multi-disciplinary context integration. The methodology
enables to create methods as displayed in the following sec-
tions, supporting many features required for integration and
analysis, e.g., semi-automated referencing, chorology faceting,
chronology faceting, multi-disciplinary contexts, and creation
of result matrices.
The result matrices and facets reﬂect the key assets with
the CRI framework [9] to realise the inventory and symbolic
representations and to enable a continuous development.
B. Resulting symbolic representation of features groups facets
Figure 1 shows a resulting symbolic representation of a
volcanological features group, strato volcano, as based on the
coherent conceptual knowledge integration. Generated repre-
sentations include integrated CKRI references, projection of
bathymetric and topographic results, and further knowledge
for respective areas. The symbolic representation enables the
signiﬁcation of the different facets. Here distinctly coloured
volcano symbols represent the volcanological features groups
and respective conceptual knowledge facets in the visualisa-
tion of the result matrix objects. Figure 2 shows a resulting
symbolic representation of a volcanological features group,
maars, as based on the coherent conceptual knowledge in-
tegration.
The views of the result matrix further include
the conceptual knowledge features groups facets of shield
volcanoes (Figure 3), explosion craters (Figure 4), volcanic
ﬁelds (Figure 5), subglacial volcanoes (Figure 6), submarine
volcanoes (Figure 7), cones (Figure 8), and complex volcanoes
(Figure 9).
The resulting symbolic representations reﬂect the coherent
conceptual knowledge (CKRI, UDC references) and bathymet-
ric and topographic knowledge (CRI components). Projection

for all representations is Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area. Ellip-
soid is World Geodetic System 84 (WGS-84). The conceptual
knowledge references correspond with the symbolism, e.g.,
automatic assignment of symbols, e.g., volcano symbols or
different colours for different volcanological features groups
and facets.
These features groups integrate bathymetric and topographic
knowledge, for example. Here, available multi-disciplinary
knowledge can be used for contextualisation, e.g., representing
characteristics, physical properties, plate tectonics, soil, and
age. Further features allow analysis of contexts, e.g., prehistor-
ical and archaeological properties, continentality regime, coast
line dependences, and coast distance. The conceptual knowl-
edge view groups of object entities of Holocene-prehistoric
volcanological features groups correspond with the result ma-
trix (Table VI).
Entities of each features group refer to any further available
volcanological knowledge, e.g., factual knowledge. In these
excerpts, the symbolic representations include the calculated
object labels, calculated country codes, distance markers up to
300 km in 50 km steps, and calculated country height range of
bathymetry / topography.
The
generated
symbolic
representations
can
integrate
most recent knowledge (e.g., factual, conceptual, procedural,
metacognitive, structural) contributed by disciplines and can
therefore consider multi-disciplinary results and ﬁndings in
order to create conceptual knowledge references and new
insight.

COMPONENTS INTEGRATED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
AND REALISATION
The following passages give a compact overview of major
component implementations and development integrated with
this research. More detailed, comprehensive discussion and ex-
amples regarding fundaments are available with the references
on methodology, contextualisation, and conceptual knowledge.
The created and further developed reference implementa-
tions of conceptual knowledge frameworks (this research major
references in Tables I and IV) are used with the implementation
and realisation KR [15].
Conceptual knowledge base is The Universal Decimal Clas-
siﬁcation (UDC) [16], a general plan for knowledge classiﬁ-
cation, providing an analytico-synthetic and faceted classiﬁca-
tion, designed for subject description and indexing of content
of information resources irrespective of the carrier, form, for-
mat, and language. UDC-based references for demonstration
are taken from the multi-lingual UDC summary [16] released
by the UDC Consortium, Creative Commons license [18].
Relevant scientiﬁc practices, frameworks, and standards
from disciplines and contexts are integrated with the Knowl-
edge Resources, e.g., here details regarding volcanological

features [19], chronologies, spatial information, and Volcanic
Explosivity Index (VEI) [20].
All integration components, for all disciplines, require an
explicit and continuous formalisation [21] process. The for-
malisation includes computation model support, e.g., paralleli-
sation standards, OpenMP [22], Reg Exp patterns, e.g., Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) [23].
Methodologies for creating and utilising methods include
model processing, remote sensing, spatial mapping, high in-
formation densities, and visualisation. Respective contextual-
isation of (prehistoric) scenarios should each be done under
speciﬁc (prehistoric) conditions, especially supported by state-
of-the-art methods, e.g., spatial operations, triangulation, gra-
dient computation, and projection.
The symbolic representation of the contextualisation can be
done with a wide range of methods, algorithms, and available
components, e.g., via LX Professional Scientiﬁc Content-
Context-Suite (LX PSCC Suite) [24] deploying the Generic
Mapping Tools (GMT) [25] for visualisation.

Several coherent systems of major natural sciences’ context
object groups from KR realisations have been implemented,
especially Knowledge Resources focussing on volcanological
features [20] deployed with in depth contextualisation [19] and
with a wide range [16] of contexts [15] and structures [28].
The contextualisation for the inventory can employ state-of-
the-art results from many disciplines, e.g., context from the
natural sciences resources, integrating their inherent represen-
tation and common utilisation, e.g., points, polygons, lines,
Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Terrain Model (DTM),
and Digital Surface Model (DSM) representations sources,
e.g., from satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), z-
value representations, distance representations, area repre-
sentations, raster, vector, binary, and non-binary data. Em-
ployed resources are High Resolution (HR) (Space) Shuttle
Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) [29] data fusion [30], HR
Digital Chart of the World (DCW) [31], and Global Self-
consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography (GSHHG)
[32]. SRTM was produced under the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Making Earth System Data

SRTM15 Plus [30] is continuously updated and improved [29].
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation of prehistoric targets can
use the overall insight from all disciplines, e.g., parametrising
algorithms and creating palaeolandscapes.
Structure is an organisation of interrelated entities in a mate-
rial or non-material object or system [28]. Structure is essential
in logic as it carries unique information. Structure means
features and facilities. There are merely higher and lower
facility levels of how structures can be addressed, which result
from structure levels. Structure can, for example, be addressed
by logic, names, references, address labels, pointers, fuzzy
methods, phonetic methods. The deployment of long-term
universal structure and data standards is essential. Relevant
examples of sustainable implementations are NetCDF [36]

DISCUSSION
Implementation and realisation provide a coherent concep-
tual contextualisation and a seamlessly coherent conceptual
knowledge integration and faceting with any available knowl-
edge resources.
The methodology and its implemented methods proved
to enable sustainable, advanced contextualisation [37] and
method integration [38], e.g., for prehistorical and classical
archaeology and their multi-disciplinary contexts.
The practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory of volcanolog-
ical features groups shows important characteristics for multi-
disciplinary knowledge space, e.g.:
•
Coherent conceptual knowledge integration.
•
Selection and coherent integration of resources.
•
Flexible criteria for knowledge integration.

(excerpt). Generated results include CKRI references, projection of bathymetric / topographic results, and further knowledge for respective areas.
•
High level of knowledge consistency.
•
High level of reproducibility for workﬂows and results.
•
Automated and semi-automated workﬂow creation.
•
Consequent multi-language support (e.g., UDC).
•
Deployment of structural knowledge.
•
Deployment of available processing and ﬁltering.
•
Spatial integration and processing.
•
Georeferencing, generic components and results.
Characteristics for component space are, e.g.:
•
Dynamical integration of resources and workﬂows.
•
Arbitrary numbers of contextualisation results.
•
Flexible creation of workﬂows and parallelisation.
•
Scalable realisation, e.g., parallelisation models.
Knowledge and its complements are interrelated with pos-
sible structures and the organisation of knowledge, which
contributes to the facilities, which can be parametrised and
deployed, e.g., ﬂexibility of data locality and parallelisation.
The reference implementation supports parallelisation, e.g.,
embarrassingly parallel procedures, e.g., via OpenMP [22] and
job parallel procedures.
The CRI framework components allow efﬁcient paralleli-

sations for any part of workﬂows and resources, e.g., paral-
lel computation, processing, and generation of frames from
satellite data including parallel deployment of Knowledge
Resources for multi-dimensional model creation.
Each set of component integration can range from a few to
millions of entities for each result group and in consequence
millions of symbolic representations for integrated contexts.
In the case of the practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory
of volcanological features groups we create about 500–1000
basic object entity sets per context.
The CKRI and the CRI framework enable ﬂexible, systemat-
ical, and sustainable multi-disciplinary contextualisation from
methodology to realisation, e.g.,
•
semi-automated referencing,
•
chorology views,
•
chronology views,
•
multi-disciplinary contexts,
•
automated symbolic representation, e.g., graphical rep-
resentation and visualisation,
•
sustainable standardised components,
and a myriad of further features.

Together with the corresponding procedural component

employed in a wide range of disciplines and different ongoing
projects in prehistorical and classical archaeology and multi-
disciplinary contextualisation.
VII.
CONCLUSION
Employing the methodology of coherent conceptual knowl-
edge contextualisation for developing a coherent context
integration in prehistory and archaeology proved effective,
efﬁcient, scalable, and sustainable during all long-term devel-
opment and practical use.
The goal of creating a practical Holocene-prehistoric inven-
tory of worldwide volcanological features groups facets based
on the CKRI and CRI framework was successful achieved and
allows further coherent contextualisation with knowledge re-
sources, especially for the integration and contextualisation of
multi-disciplinary research in prehistory, archaeology, natural
sciences, and humanities.
Procedural knowledge and realisation aspects, e.g., com-
ponent framework, data integration from prehistory and ar-

chaeology, satellite data processing, and further parallelisation
development, are addressed by a separate long-term research
work package [5].
The methodology enables the practical contextualisation and
integration of knowledge, supporting systematical and method-
ological backprojections for disciplines employing their meth-
ods in interaction with future multi-dimensional and multi-
disciplinary knowledge models and symbolic representations.
Future work will address the resulting and continuously
further developed Holocene-prehistoric inventory of worldwide
volcanological features, continuous resources development,
coherent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge contextual-
isation, new advanced multi-dimensional context integration
models, and integration with prehistorical and archaeological
knowledge resources, e.g., with the ongoing multi-disciplinary
development of PAKA [17], including further georeferencing
and spatial processing.
