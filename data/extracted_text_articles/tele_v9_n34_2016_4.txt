Abstract--The
rising
complexity
of
product
and
systems
demands
further
attention
to
potential
Risks.
While
researchers explore tools and methods to identify system risk,
its prioritization remains a challenging task in a multi-
stakeholder environment. Hazard is the source of risk and
causes harm. Harm may have different degree of severity. Next
to the degree of severity, frequency of its occurrence is relevant
to risk. These are often hardly quantifiable. While the accurate
quantification remains a challenge, a flexible and pluralistic
approach can bring major risks on the top of list. This paper
offers a methodology for ranking risks in early phases of
design with presence of a high level of uncertainty. It uses a
pluralistic approach for prioritization of hazards. It adapts
probability theory to embed flexibly in communication with
stakeholders
and
process
the
available
information.
A
graphical
tool
facilitates
this
communication
and
probabilistically utilize available information about system
hazards. It suggests the “degree of consensus” as a metric to
rank the identified risks. This metric represents the consent of
stakeholders on the system risks used for system architecture,
design decisions, or alternative evaluations. The paper explains
the mathematical formulation and presents an application
example for this.
Keywords - consensus; risk; severity; occurrence; uncertainty;
prioritization; ranking.
I.
INTRODUCTION
A.
Risk and hazard
Hazards are the risk sources, and their proper recognition
and prioritization leads to a better understanding of risks and
their
management.
The
rising
complexity
and
cross-
disciplinary nature of systems demands further development
for identification of hazards [1, 2]. Hazard is the potential
source of harm [3], and this creates a direct link between
hazard and risk. If a hazard is not identified, risks remain
unattended.
The European norm on risk assessment [4] summaries
the tools and methods applicable to hazard identification in
categories
of
strongly
applicable
and
applicable.
The
strongly applicable methods for risk identifications are
brainstorming, Delphi, Check-lists, Primary hazard analysis,
Hazard and operability studies (HAZOP), Environmental
risk assessment, SWIFT, Scenario analysis (SA), Failure
mode
and
effect
analysis
(FMEA),
Cause-and-effect
analysis, Human reliability analysis (HRA), Reliability
centered
maintenance
(RCM),
Consequence/probability
matrix. The applicable methods for hazard identifications are
Business impact analysis (BIA), Fault tree analysis (FTA),
Event tree analysis (ETA), Cause and consequence analysis
(CCA), Layer protection analysis, Sneak circuit analysis,
Markov analysis, FN curves, Risk indices, cost/benefit
analysis, and Multi-criteria decision analysis.
After recognition of a hazard, severity of its harm and
probability of its occurrence is needed to estimate the risk as
shown in the figure below.
Figure 1. Risk is a function of severity of harm and
probability of occurrence of that harm [4].
Next sections in the paper highlights the importance of
risk and uncertainty recognition in early project phase, the
involvement of stakeholders for elicitation, and the influence
of hazards on system requirements. Thereafter, the paper
discusses an approach for the modelling and communication
for system risks. As hazard is the source of risk, terms
hazards and risks are interchangeably used in the context of
this paper.
B.
Risk and uncertainty
There are always many factors and influences which can
make it uncertain whether the project achieves its objectives.
This uncertainty in early project phases is very high as
discussed in details in [5]. Besides, the complexity of
projects intensifies this uncertainty as shown in Figure 2.
This uncertainty imposes risk on the project, and the
mitigation of this risk is easier in early project phase. Figure
2 shows that the cost of risk mitigation increases as the
project further develops. In order to manage this risk, the
first step is its identification, then analysis, evaluation, and
then taking appropriate measurements.

Figure 2. This figure highlights the presence of uncertainty and risk in the course of a full project life-cycle (adapted from [5]).
In early project phases, proper actions against risk
factors, results in many competitor advantages including but
not limited to the following (see [6]):

higher likelihood for success

encouraging the proactive measurements against
risk factors

higher stakeholder confidence and trust

identification of opportunities and treats

more effective use of resources against risk
factors
To properly identify project risks and progress in the
project, useful information is required. This information
reduces uncertainties, increases utilities, and creates value
for the system. This is because useful information for a
designer leads to better design choices that ultimately
influence the rest of design including concept, details, or
services. This quest, however, may result in information
overwhelming, and a design team may be exposed to a lot of
information that hinders focusing on the key aspects. In
system design with the multi-stakeholder nature of systems,
divergent expectations of stakeholders can prevent a designer
to focus on the key drivers for a system design.
In an interdisciplinary system, there are a lot of mono- or
multi- disciplinary hazards that are hard to quantify or
prioritize. Quantification of hazards in the form of frequency
of occurrence or severity comes after its realization.
Furthermore, this quantification may be subject to change
over time.
Lack of proper hazard identification or prioritization
leads
to
rising
complexity
in
the
risk
analysis
and
management.
Most
of
the
currently
applied
hazard
identification methods result in a hazard pool. In such a
view, a larger system results a larger hazard pool which
makes the prioritization more complex. The next section
discusses this in further details.
C.
System hazards and requirements
A good understanding of hazards and risks helps
developing a proper list of (safety) requirements. The
importance of requirements have been discussed in design
literatures, see e.g. [7]. This study adapts a pluralistic
approach
for
highlighting
system
hazards,
risks
or
requirements.
Literatures have discussed that many engineering design
methods pay attention to system risks when there is already a
concept for the system. Yet proper view of main hazards
helps forming an architecture that fits better to them [8, 9].
Recognition of system hazards is indeed a pluralistic
approach, and the design team/ architecture need to approach
different system stakeholders and explore their concerns
about the system risks and hazards. Stakeholder in this paper
is used as a general term that includes system shareholders,
users, designers, experts and etcetera, and the concern refers
to a stakeholder concern including the specific hazard.
Literatures confirm that an incomplete set of stakeholders
may lead to incomplete results since there are problems

arising from the scope, understanding and validation of
needs, concerns or concern [10, 11] in the course of
communication with stakeholders. Therefore, identification
of stakeholders and elicitation of information are considered
as prerequisites for understanding the system hazards.
Systems often involves a large number of stakeholders [12].
Figure 3 presents the functional diagram for identifying
stakeholders and communicating with them. This results in a
pool of hazards with a lot of information [see [1]]. Ranking
of this information helps the designer to keep her focus on
the key aspects. Recognition of key hazards is likely to be
seen subjectively as different stakeholders tend to focus on
their areas of interest and pay more attention to the hazards
that influence their interest.
This study builds on the previous study [1] on ranking
system hazards and suggests ranking of system risks based
on two measures of severity and occurrence through a
pluralistic approach. It therefore focuses to offer a pluralistic
approach
that
communicates
well
with
stakeholders,
provides freedom for presenting the opinions, and embraces
doubts or uncertainties in their information.
D.
Ranking of system hazards
This study builds on the assumption that key hazards in
design are recognized by the consensus of stakeholders, and
they can be rated systematically through a ranking process.
In general, ranking of parameters (hazards) based on their
importance is well discussed in decision models. The use of
multi criteria decision models typically involves a systematic
ranking process as for instance indicated in [13, 14]. The
influence of the ranking process on final decisions is for
example explained in [15]. A review of subjective ranking
methods shows that different methods cannot guarantee
accurate results. This inconsistency in judgment explains
difficulty of assigning reliable and subjective weights to the
requirements. A systematic approach for ranking is described
in [16] that is a generalization of Saaty’s pairwise structure
[17]. Given the presence of subjectivity in the ranking
process, sensitivity analysis of the design criteria is used to
study the influence of variation and the ranking process on
the decisions made [18]. Furthermore, some approaches e.g.
the task-oriented weighing approach is effectively used. This
approach is meant to limit the subjectivity of criteria
weighting [19]. It suggests an algorithm to rank criteria
objectively while considering the uncertainty in criteria
weight [20]. The approach is based on introducing fuzzy
numbers that imposes specified membership functions,
which has been also used in [21, 22].
The methods used to identify the system hazards are
mentioned earlier in this paper. The outlines of these
methods are available elsewhere in for example [6]. The use
of these methods results in a bank of information called a
“pool of hazards”.
E.
Pool of hazards; severity, occurrence and risk
The so called pool of hazards integrates the identified
hazards that threaten the system. This pool includes all the
system hazards recognized by stakeholders. As the pool can
become of enormous size, a method is required for listing
them based on their priorities. Figure 4 schematically shows
a set of hazards recognized for a system. For ranking the
system hazards, this study uses two metrics of frequency of
occurrence and degree of severity. These metrics are further
described in the next sections.
Figure 3. The process of identification of system stakeholders and system hazards.

Figure 4. A schematic view for the pool of hazards. Every
shape in this pool stands for a hazard.
1)
Severity of harm
Harm is defined as physical injury or damage to persons,
property, and livestock [23].
A Systems Engineer or
designer is advised to define the severity of harm and
communicate it with the stakeholders. For example, IEC
(see [23]) defines three categories for severity of harms.
This reference defines three categories of harm which are
slight, high and serious as explained below.

Slight
harm
which
is
normally reversible or
reparable in short term

High
harm
which
is
normally
reversible
or
reparable in longer term

Serious harm which is normally irreversible and
irreparable or death.
The issue with this approach is that the user has to choose
one single category, and different harms inside one category
do not make differences. To overcome this and provide
freedom to the user, these categories are presented in the
following
table
and
communicated
with
the
system
stakeholders. This enables the stakeholders to freely present
their opinion and include their lack of certainties.
Figure 5. An example table for different categories of harm.
2)
Frequency of occurrence
Likewise, there is a need for a standard table for
communication of the frequency of occurrence for each
hazard. Figure 6 presents an example table for this purpose.
This table is based on the advice of [23] which suggests
considering the occurrence or exposure time as a criterion for
this estimation.

occurrence.
II.
METRICS FOR RISKS AND HAZARDS
In
order
to
facilitate
communication
with
system
stakeholders, it is important to note that system has
stakeholders
who
can
be
individuals,
corporations,
organizations and authorities, with different fields/ levels of
knowledge and experience [5]. They all have their interests
and expectations. Their interest may overlap, interfere or
compete. This paper uses uncertainty to embed flexibility
and allow a human solution in terms of preferred alternatives
[24, 25]. This uncertainty is of human nature described
elsewhere e.g. in [26], and its formulation will be discussed
in further details through next section.

Measure of risk
Risk is a function of severity of harm and frequency of its
occurrence. In a two dimensional space of severity and
occurrence, a larger distance from the origin means a larger
risk. Therefore, the risk measure depends on both severity
and occurrence, and it is obtained by the following formula

Algorithm
This section describes the steps needed for ranking the
risks. A summary of these steps is shown in Figure 7.
1. List m stakeholders and n concerns for system of
interest.
Determine
the
weight
of
stakeholders’
opinions if they are not evenly graded.
2. List the hazards and make tables for their severity using
the numeric or verbal format shown in Figure 5 and
Figure 6.
3. Ask the stakeholders to fill the tables. This step
concludes m series of tables. Use
kis
format to label
the collected information for each table, where k refers
to the kth stakeholders.
4. Calculate the expected value and standard deviation for
each table:
k
s
i and
k
is
 for each
kis .
5. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the
severity of each hazard
s
i and
is
 .
6. Normalize the severity of hazards and calculate the
relative weight factor and its uncertainty.
7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 for the frequency of occurrence
instead of the severity of hazard.
8. Use Equation 13 and estimate the risk.
9. Rank the hazards based on their risk, severity, or
probability of occurrence.
This process uses the collected information and sorts the
system concerns based on the stakeholders’ opinion. The
next section presents an example application for this.
III.
EXAMPLE APPLICATION
To illustrate the application of the proposed method, a
simple example is presented in this section. In the example,
there are four items in the pool of hazards. These hazards
have been schematically shown by geometrical shapes as
shown in Figure 8. This figure presents that two stakeholders
have estimated the severity and frequency of occurrence of
the hazards. Figure 8 (a) and (c) respectively show opinion
of the first stakeholder over the severity and occurrence of
the hazards. Figure 8 (b) and (d) present the opinion of the
second stakeholder. The verbal explanation of the tables is
not included in this example and only the numerical scale is
presented. In this example, the stakeholders are not evenly
graded. The importance of stakeholder 1 and stakeholder 2
are weighted as 0.7 and 0.3, respectively.
IV.
DISCUSSION
Applying the algorithm explained in Section II.B results in
the outcome shown in TABLE 1. The first two columns of
this table shows the hazards information. Columns 3 and 4
present the average of expert opinions over the severity and
occurrence of harms associated to the hazards. Based on the
uncertainty of these estimates, the degree of consensus is
shown in Columns 5 and 6. A higher value in these columns
represents
a
higher
consensus
on
the
stakeholder’s
agreement. Based on these, the risk metric is presented in
the last column representing the stakeholders consensus on
the values of risk. The conclusion may be drown from the
risk values is that the second hazard is less risky than the
others according to the stakeholder’s opinion. As seen in
this table, the hazards can be ranked based on the severity of
harm or its frequency of occurrence. For illustration,
Figure 9 shows the risk area depicted in a two-
dimensional space of severity and occurrence. Such a figure
can
summarize
the
information
collected
from
the
stakeholders and provide further insight about the risk
priorities in early system design.

This example shows how the method is used to
communicate with stakeholders, register their concerns,
integrate the collected data and disclose the most important
aspects. Similar results have been achieved through real-
world case studies to prioritize the stakeholder consensus in
terms of project requirements. See for example [26, 28].

CONCLUSIONS
The paper proposes a graphical tool to communicate with
stakeholders, collect the risk information and combine it in
order to prioritize the system risks. A pluralistic approach is
used to probabilistically measure the severity of harm and
frequency of occurrence. These metrics are used to find the
degree of stakeholders’ consensus over system risks and rank
them. The proposed approach is based on probability theory
and promotes probabilistic thinking. The use of this outcome
for triangulation of risk concerns is the next step for this
research.
