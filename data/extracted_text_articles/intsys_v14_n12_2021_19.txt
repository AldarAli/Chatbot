Abstract—These days, many people use a Social Networking
Service (SNS). Most SNS users are careful in protecting the
privacy of personal information: name, age, gender, address,
telephone number, birthday, etc. However, some SNS users
disclose their personal information that can threaten their privacy
and security even if they use non-real name accounts. In this
study, we investigated tweets disclosing submitters’ personal
proﬁle items which many of us think are not true. We collected
565 tweets where submitters used non-real name accounts and
made promises to disclose their personal proﬁle items, surveyed
the details of their personal proﬁle items disclosed by themselves,
especially their ages, genders, heights, and foot sizes, and analyzed
them statistically by applying the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality
and the Welch’s test. The results of these tests showed that most
of the submitters disclosed their ages, genders, heights, and foot
sizes honestly.

INTRODUCTION
These days, many people use a Social Networking Service
(SNS) to communicate with each other and try to enlarge their
circle of friends. SNS users are generally concerned about
potential privacy risks. To be speciﬁc, they are afraid that
unwanted audiences will obtain information about them or
their families, such as where they live, work, and play. As
a result, SNS users are generally careful in disclosing their
personal information. They disclose their personal information
only when they think the beneﬁts of doing so are greater
than the potential privacy risks. However, some SNS users,
especially young users, disclose personal information on their
proﬁles, for example, real full name, gender, hometown and
full date of birth, which can potentially be used to identify
details of their real life, such as their social security numbers.
In order to discuss this phenomenon, many researchers investi-
gated how much and which type of information is disclosed in
SNSs, especially, on Facebook. Researchers might think that
personal information disclosed on Facebook is reliable, or it is
possible to check whether personal information disclosed on
Facebook is true. This is because
•
Facebook users are required to register and disclose
their real names when they ﬁrst start using Facebook.
•
Facebook users would be criticized by their friends if
they disclose their information dishonestly.
On the other hand, a small number of researchers investigated
how much and which type of information is disclosed by non-
real name account users, such as Twitter users. Researchers

items in her tweets.
might think that personal information disclosed by non-real
name account users is unreliable. This is because
•
nobody criticizes non-real name account users when
they disclose their personal information dishonestly.
•
true personal information can threaten their privacy
and security even if they use non-real name accounts.
As a result, many of us think that it is natural for non-real
name account users not to disclose their personal information
honestly. Figure 1 shows tweets submitted by non-real name
account user, Rina. In these tweets, Rina disclosed her personal
proﬁle items: her age, gender, birthday, zodiac sign, height,
and foot size. Many of us think that these personal proﬁle
items were not true. However, we cannot check whether Rina

Figure 2. A tweet promising to disclose the same number of submitters’

disclosed her personal proﬁle items honestly because it is
difﬁcult to do it. To solve this problem, we collected tweets
where non-real name account users made promises to disclose
their personal proﬁle items, analyzed them statistically, and
showed that it is likely that most of the non-real name
account users, especially young users, disclosed their personal
information honestly [1]. In this paper, we survey and analyze
these tweets by taking into account foot size that has not been
paid attention to before and discuss whether their submitters
disclosed their ages, genders, heights, and foot sizes honestly.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we show how
to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ personal proﬁle items.
In Section IV, we survey the details of submitters’ personal
proﬁle items, analyze them statistically, and show that it is
likely that most of the submitters disclosed their personal
proﬁle items honestly. Finally, in Section V, we present our
conclusions.
II.
RELATED WORK
Personally identiﬁable information is deﬁned as informa-
tion which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as social security number, biometric records,
etc. alone, or when combined with other information that is
linkable to a speciﬁc individual, such as date and place of
birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. [2] [3]. Unsafe disclosure
of personal information on SNSs can lead to several concerns
such as cyberbullies, addiction, risky behavior, and contact
with dangerous communities [4]. Internet users are generally
concerned about unwanted audiences obtaining personal in-
formation. Fox et al. reported that 86% of Internet users are
concerned that unwanted audiences will obtain information
about them or their families [5]. Also, Acquisti and Gross
reported that students expressed high levels of concern for
general privacy issues on Facebook, such as a stranger ﬁnding
out where they live and the location and schedule of their
classes, and a stranger learning their sexual orientation, name
of their current partner, and their political afﬁliations [6]. How-
ever, Internet users, especially young users, tend to disclose
personal information on their proﬁles, for example, real full
name, gender, hometown and full date of birth, which can
potentially be used to identify details of their real life, such as
their social security numbers. As a result, many researchers
discussed the reasons why young users willingly disclose
personal information on their SNS proﬁles. Barnes argues that
Internet users, especially teenagers, are not aware of the nature
of the Internet and SNSs [7]. On the other hand, Hinduja and
Patchin analyzed randomly sampled MySpace proﬁle pages
and reported that the majority of adolescents are responsibly
using the web site [8]. Krasnova et al. reported that SNS
users are primarily motivated to disclose personal information
because SNSs are fun and convenient to develop their social
networks [9]. Van der Heijden also reported that users’ sense
of enjoyment is a strong intention to use information systems
[10]. For example, Liu et al. showed that the sense of enjoy-
ment positively inﬂuences the intention of Chinese university
students to use SNSs [11]. In contrast, Pavlou et al. reported
that users’ perception on privacy risk negatively inﬂuences
their intention to use online services [12]. Viseu et al. reported
that many online users believe the beneﬁts of disclosing
personal information in order to use an Internet site are greater
than the potential privacy risks [13]. Joinson et al. reported that
trust and perceived privacy had a strong effect on individuals’
willingness to disclose personal information to a website [14].
Also, Tufekci found that concern about unwanted audiences
had an impact on whether or not students revealed their real
names and religious afﬁliation on MySpace and Facebook
[15]. The authors also think that most students are seriously
concerned about their privacy and security. However, they often
underestimate the risk of their online messages and submit
them. For example, Watanabe et al. reported that many students
submit tweets concerning school events and these tweets may
give a chance to other people, including unwanted audiences,
to distinguish which schools students go to [16]. Hirai reported
that many users experienced trouble in SNSs because they did
not mind that strangers observed their communication with
their friends [17]. On the other hand, Acquisti and Gross
explain this phenomenon as a disconnection between the users’
desire to protect their privacy and their actual behavior [6].
Dwyer concluded in her research that privacy is often not
expected or undeﬁned in SNSs [18]. Also, Livingstone points
out that teenagers’ concept of privacy does not match the
privacy settings of most SNSs [19]. Hui et al. reported that
online companies can induce users to disclose their personal
information by offering beneﬁts [20].

A COLLECTION OF TWEETS DISCLOSING
SUBMITTERS’ PERSONAL PROFILE ITEMS
It is difﬁcult to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ per-
sonal proﬁle items, such as tweets in Figure 1, directly. To
solve this problem, we focused on tweets where submitters
promised their followers to disclose the same number of their
own personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. Figure 2
shows a tweet submitted by Rina on September 3, 2019. In
this tweet, Rina promised her followers to disclose the same
number of her personal proﬁle items as likes to her tweet.
Actually, Rina submitted 35 replies disclosing her personal
proﬁle items to her tweet shown in Figure 2 from September
3 to 9, 2019. The six tweets shown in Figure 1 were the ﬁrst six

(b) The number of submitters who disclosed that they were women by age.

replies submitted by Rina to her tweets shown in Figure 2. As
of November 20, 2019, we conﬁrmed that 37 likes were given
to her tweet shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, we found many
tweets promising to disclose the same number of their own
personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. As a result, it is
easy to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ personal proﬁle
items when we collect tweets promising to disclose submitters’
personal proﬁle items. The reasons why many Twitter users
submitted tweets promising to disclose submitters’ personal
proﬁle items might be
•
they thought they looked fun,
•
they wanted to draw attention, and
•
they wanted to know how much attention was paid to
their tweets.
In order to collect tweets promising to disclose submitters’
personal proﬁle items, we focused on images attached to these
tweets. This is because many submitters attached the same
image to their tweets and many personal proﬁle items were
listed in the image. As shown in Figure 2, Rina attached an
image to her tweet and showed the list of personal proﬁle items
that she promised her followers to disclose in the image. Many
twitter users attached the same image to their tweets promising
to disclose their personal proﬁle items. As a result, we used
these shared images as key to collect tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items. To be speciﬁc, we
collected these tweets by using Twigaten [21]. Twigaten helps
us to collect tweets to which the same image is attached. By

using Twigaten, we collected 565 Japanese tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items on November 20,
2019. The obtained tweets were submitted from October 3,
2018 to November 20, 2019.
IV.
AN ANALYSIS OF TWEETS DISCLOSING SUBMITTERS’
PERSONAL PROFILE ITEMS
It is difﬁcult to determine whether an individual submitter
disclosed his/her personal proﬁle items honestly. For example,
it is difﬁcult to determine whether Rina, who submitted tweets
in Figure 1 and Figure 2, was a woman. In this study, we
discuss whether submitters disclosed their personal proﬁle
items honestly when they made promises to disclose them. In
order to discuss this problem, we analyze submitters’ genders,
ages, heights, and foot sizes statistically.
A. Submitters’ genders
As mentioned in Section III, we obtained the 565 tweets
promising to disclose user’s personal proﬁle items. We sur-
veyed these 565 tweets and their replies and, according to
submitters’ genders disclosed in the replies, classiﬁed them
into
•
282 tweets (women)
•
156 tweets (men)
•
27 tweets (unclear)
•
100 tweets (no replies)
B. Submitters’ ages
We also surveyed the 565 tweets and their replies and,
according to whether submitters’ ages were disclosed in their
replies clearly, classiﬁed them into
•
276 tweets (clearly)
•
60 tweets (unclearly)
•
229 tweets (no replies)
When submitter’s age was disclosed such as “early 20s”
and “over thirty”, we determined that submitter’s age was
disclosed unclearly. Among the 276 tweets where submitters’
ages were disclosed clearly, we found 102 and 161 tweets
where submitters’ genders were also disclosed clearly, men and
women, respectively. Figure 3 shows the number of submitters,
who disclosed their genders clearly, men and women, by age.
As shown in Figure 3, the most popular age of men and women
were 16 and 15 years old, respectively.
C. Submitters’ heights
We also surveyed the 565 tweets and their replies and,
according to whether submitters’ heights were disclosed in
their replies clearly, classiﬁed them into
•
401 tweets (clearly),
•
8 tweets (unclearly), and
•
156 tweets (no replies).
Among the 401 tweets where submitters’ heights were dis-
closed clearly, we found 131 and 244 tweets where submitters’
genders were disclosed clearly, men and women, respectively.
Figure 4 shows the histogram of heights of submitters who
disclosed their genders, men or women, clearly.
(a) the histogram of submitters’ heights (disclosed genders: men).
(b) the histogram of submitters’ heights (disclosed genders: women).
Figure 4. The histogram of heights of submitters who disclosed their
genders, men or women, clearly. (bin width = 5cm)
It is difﬁcult to determine whether an individual submitter
disclosed his/her personal proﬁle items honestly. In this study,
we statistically examine whether submitters disclosed their
personal proﬁle items honestly when they made promises to
disclose their personal proﬁle items and disclosed them in the
same way as Rina did.
It is well known that our heights follow a normal (Gaus-
sian) distribution [22]. As a result, if most of submitters
disclose their ages, genders, and heights honestly, their heights
would follow a normal distribution. Also, the average of their
heights would be equal to the national average height in Japan.
To solve this problem, in this paper, we conduct the statistical
analysis on
•
37 submitters who disclosed their genders (men), ages
(15-17 years old), and heights clearly, and
•
60 submitters who disclosed their genders (women),
ages (14-16 years old), and heights clearly.

As shown in Figure 3, men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-16
were the most popular segments in the submitters’ ages.
First, we discuss whether submitters’ heights followed a
normal distribution. Figure 5 shows the histograms of their
heights. In order to discuss whether submitters’ heights fol-
lowed a normal distribution, we conducted the Shapiro-Wilk
test of normality. The null hypothesis in this study was that
submitters’ heights followed a normal distribution. Table I
shows the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on
heights. As shown in Table I, the p-value in each case was
greater than 0.05. As a result, the null hypothesis in each case
was not rejected. In other words, submitters’ heights, in each
case of men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-16, followed a
normal distribution.
Next, we discuss whether the average of submitters’ heights
was equal to the national average height in Japan. Table II
shows the average of submitters’ heights. Table III shows
the national average height in Japan [23]. In order to discuss
whether the average of their heights was equal to the national
average height in Japan, we conducted the Welch’s test. The
null hypothesis in this study was that the average of submitters’
heights was equal to the national average height in Japan. Table
IV shows the results of the Welch’s test. As shown in Table
IV, the p-value in each case was greater than 0.05. As a result,
the null hypothesis in each case was not rejected. In other
words, in each case of men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-

16, the average of submitters’ heights was equal to the national
average height in Japan.
The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and the
Welch’s test rarely happened when many submitters disclosed
their ages, genders, and heights dishonestly. As a result, it
is assumed that most of the submitters disclosed their ages,
genders, and heights honestly. Furthermore, age, gender, and
height were important personal information. It is likely that
they disclosed not only their ages, genders, and heights but
also other personal proﬁle items honestly.
D. Submitters’ foot sizes
We also surveyed the 565 tweets and their replies and,
according to whether submitters’ foot sizes were disclosed in
their replies clearly, classiﬁed them into
•
257 tweets (clearly),
•
20 tweets (unclearly), and
•
288 tweets (no replies).
Among the 257 tweets where submitters’ foot sizes were dis-
closed clearly, we found 79 and 159 tweets where submitters’
genders were disclosed clearly, men and women, respectively.
Figure 6 shows the histogram of foot sizes of submitters who
disclosed their genders, men or women, clearly. In this section,
we statistically examine whether submitters disclosed their foot
sizes honestly.
One thing to note is that the term foot size can be
interpreted in two ways: foot length and shoe size. Katase et
al. reported that most Japanese people do not know their own
foot lengths, only know their shoe sizes, because they rarely
have the opportunity to measure their foot lengths [24]. As a
result, when Japanese submitters disclosed their foot sizes in
their tweets, their values are mainly those of their shoe sizes.
However, our shoe sizes are close to our foot lengths, and
our foot lengths are generally considered to follow a normal
distribution, like our heights. As a result, if most of submitters
disclose their ages, genders, and foot sizes honestly, their foot
sizes would follow a normal distribution. Also, the average of
their foot sizes would be equal to the average of foot sizes
surveyed in Japan. To solve this problem, in this paper, we
conduct the statistical analysis on
•
32 submitters who disclosed their genders (men), ages
(15-17 years old), and foot sizes clearly, and
•
57 submitters who disclosed their genders (women),
ages (14-16 years old), and foot sizes clearly.
As shown in Figure 3, men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-16
were the most popular segments in the submitters’ ages.

(b) the histogram of submitters’ foot sizes (disclosed genders: women).
Figure 6. The histogram of foot sizes of submitters who disclosed their
genders, men or women, clearly. (bin width = 1cm)
First, we discuss whether submitters’ foot sizes followed
a normal distribution. Figure 7 shows the histograms of their
foot sizes. In order to discuss whether submitters’ foot sizes
followed a normal distribution, we conducted the Shapiro-Wilk
test of normality. The null hypothesis in this study was that
submitters’ foot sizes followed a normal distribution. Table V
shows the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality on foot
sizes. As shown in Table V, the p-values in the cases of men
aged 15 and women aged 14 were less than 0.05, on the other
hand, those in cases of men aged 16-17 and women aged 15-
16 were greater than 0.05. As a result, the null hypothesis in
four out of the six examined cases was not rejected. In other
words, submitters’ foot sizes followed a normal distribution in
more than half of the examined cases.
Next, we discuss whether the average of submitters’ foot
sizes was equal to the average of foot sizes surveyed in Japan.

Leather and Leather Goods Industries Association (JLIA) in
October 2013 [25]. As mentioned, when Japanese submitters
disclosed their foot sizes in their tweets, their values are mainly
those of their shoe sizes. As a result, we examine whether the
average of submitters’ foot sizes was equal to the average of
shoe sizes in Japan surveyed by JLIA [25]. In order to discuss
whether the average of their foot sizes was equal to the average
of shoe sizes in Japan, we conducted the Welch’s test. The null
hypothesis in this study was that the average of submitters’
foot sizes was equal to the average of shoe sizes in Japan.
Table VIII shows the results of the Welch’s test. As shown in
Table VIII, the p-value in each case was greater than 0.05. As
a result, the null hypothesis in each case was not rejected. In
other words, in each case of men aged 15-17 and women aged
14-16, the average of submitters’ foot sizes was equal to the

The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and the
Welch’s test rarely happened when many submitters disclosed
their ages, genders, and foot sizes dishonestly. As a result, it
is assumed that most of the submitters disclosed their ages,
genders, and foot sizes honestly.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated tweets disclosing submitters’
personal proﬁle items and analyzed submitters’ ages, genders,
heights, and foot sizes statistically. The results of the statistical
analysis showed that it is likely that most of the submitters
disclosed their personal proﬁle items honestly. These personal
proﬁle items can threaten their privacy and security even if
they use non-real name accounts. We are investigating whether
submitters were concerned about their privacy and security
risks caused by submitting tweets disclosing their personal
proﬁle items honestly [26]. Furthermore, we intend to conduct
the same statistical analysis on tweets in languages other than
Japanese.
