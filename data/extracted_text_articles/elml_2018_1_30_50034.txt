Abstract—In online learning, emotional support for the learner
is important for increasing learning effectiveness. Graphical
symbols, such as emoticons, work as emotional expressions in
text-based online interactions. This study focuses on “stickers”,
a new form of graphical expression. Using questionnaires, we
asked participants how frequently they used stickers to express
seven types of emotions. This study examined the effects of
gender and text-messaging dependency on frequency of sticker
use for expressing emotions in text messaging. As a result, the
effects of gender and dependency were confirmed.
Keywords—sticker; emotional expression; gender difference;
text-messaging dependency; text messenger.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In online learning, emotional support for the learner
reduces dropout and is important for increasing learning
effectiveness. Social presence theory frequently refers to
such support as a theoretical framework [1]. This theory was
proposed in early media research and holds that media
offering few non-verbal cues have a low social presence in
comparison
with
face-to-face
communication
[2].
Subsequent online learning research has shown that social
presence can be increased by various means, even in
Computer-Mediated
Communication
(CMC)
[3][4].
Increased social presence is receiving more attention as an
important factor for helping online learning students [5]. In
personal CMC, emoticons and emoji, mutual greetings,
shared empathy, and self-disclosure are important necessary
means of increasing social presence [4]. Emoticons and
emoji
in
particular
are
closely
related
to
emotional
expressions [6]. However, in recent years, a new type of
graphical symbol known as “stickers” (illustrations, often
containing characters or text, sent in lieu of messages on
many messaging platforms) have emerged. These can be
used in text messenger apps while using mobile devices.
Originally, a sticker was an illustration that could be attached
to a text message in LINE from 2011, an instant messenger
application mainly used on smartphones in Japan [7]. By
2013, Facebook messenger was also equipped with similar
features, followed by Facebook timeline in 2014. In 2016,
iMessage for iPhone added sticker functionality.
As many previous studies have pointed out, given the
impact of symbols such as emoticons on text-based CMC
[6], stickers are considered to have potential capabilities [8].
However, few studies have investigated stickers in text
messaging. In this study, we conducted a basic survey on
stickers in text messaging with smartphones.
Specifically, we examined the effects of gender and text-
messaging dependency on sticker use in text messaging.
Many
studies
have
shown
gender
differences
in
socioemotional interactions in online communication [9],
and some studies have found that women use more
emoticons [10]. Therefore, we aimed to clarify gender
differences in sticker use for expressing emotions in text
messaging. Further, studies on text-messaging dependency
have shown that high-dependency users tend to exhibit
excessive use of text messaging to build socioemotional
relationships
[11].
High-dependency
users
who
place
importance on text-based interactions to maintain human
relationships are thought to make greater use of graphical
symbols available for communications. Accordingly, we also
investigated the effects of text-messaging dependency on
sticker use for expressing emotions in text messaging.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we present the method of this study. In Section 3, we
present the results of this study. Finally, we conclude in
Section 4.

METHOD
The survey participants were 300 Japanese students (152
women, 148 men; mean age = 20.12; standard deviation
(SD) = 1.26) at universities in the Tokyo area. They were not
students in an online course. Participation in this survey was
voluntary. Participants were asked to answer a paper-based
questionnaire.
We
asked
participants
to
report
their
frequency of sticker use in text message exchanges to
express each of seven kinds of emotion (joy, surprise,
sadness, anxiety, anger, guilt, and love) using a 6-point
Likert-like scale from 1 (not at all) to 6 (almost every time).
In addition, we asked participants about the frequency of
their daily use of stickers in text-messaging. We measured
messaging dependency using the 15-item short version of the
Text-Message Dependency Scale [11] modified by the
authors. This scale comprises emotional reaction, perception
of excessive use, and relationship maintenance subscales,
each with five questions scored on a 5-point Likert-like scale
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

RESULTS
Participants were grouped according to degree of text-
messaging dependency by calculating each participant’s
score on each subscale. Next, we used IBM SPSS Statistics
24, which is a statistical package for the social sciences, to
perform a two-step cluster analysis using the three subscale
scores as variables to comprehensively reflect their scores in
this classification. This resulted in participants’ division into
two clusters: Cluster 1 (N = 154) contained the high text-
messaging dependency group and Cluster 2 (N = 146) the
low dependency group.
To investigate the influence of gender and degree of text-
messaging dependency on usual frequency of sticker use, we
assigned gender and dependency groups (high and low) as
between-subjects factors and then performed a two-way
analysis of variance. The results of the analysis of variance
were as follows: the main effect of gender, F(1, 295) = 46.92,
p < 0.001; and the main effect of dependency, F(1, 295) =
0.93, ns. There was no significant interaction. This result
indicates that, compared with men, women used more
stickers in text messaging on a daily basis.
Next, to investigate the influence of gender and degree of
text-messaging dependency on frequency of sticker use for
expressing each of seven emotions, we assigned gender and
dependency groups as between-subjects factors, and then
performed a two-way analysis of variance in each emotion.
A significant main effect of gender was seen in the following
five emotions: joy: F(1, 296) = 73.79, p < 0.001; surprise:
F(1, 296) = 6.03, p < 0.05; sadness: F(1, 295) = 40.71, p <
0.001; guilt: F(1, 296) = 22.66, p < 0.001; love: F(1, 295) =
45.72, p < 0.001. A marginally significant main effect of
dependency was seen in the following three emotions: joy:
F(1, 296) = 3.55, p = 0.061; sadness: F(1, 295) = 3.15, p =
0.077; anxiety: F(1, 295) = 3.19, p = 0.075. There was no
significant interaction for all seven emotions. These results
are as follows. Joy and sadness were affected by both gender
and dependency. Surprise, guilt and love were affected only
by gender. Anxiety was affected only by dependency. Anger
was not affected by either gender or dependency. These
results are shown in Figure 1.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This study investigated emotional expression using
stickers as preliminary research into new emotional support
in online learning via smartphones. To date, there have been
almost no reports of research on stickers internationally. Our
findings showed that, compared with men, women used
stickers more frequently on a daily basis, and more
frequently used them to express joy, surprise, sadness, guilt,
and love. These gender differences are consistent with the
results of previous studies on symbols such as emoticons
used in text-based CMC [10]. In addition, our findings
showed that individuals with high dependency use stickers
more frequently than those with low dependency to express
joy, sadness, and anxiety. Within the context of dependency,
the most characteristic result was considered to be expression
of anxiety, where no gender difference was noticed. This
result may be attributable to individuals with high

dependency tending to often feel uneasy about maintaining
human relationships in online communication [11]. There
was no difference between individuals with high dependency
and individuals with low dependency regarding the usual use
of stickers. Stickers are not only used to express emotions –
they can also be used to convey various communicative
intents such as expressing opinions and attitudes [8].
Individuals with low dependency may use stickers more for
purposes other than emotional communication. Verification
of this is work for future research. The findings of this study
and subsequent works will provide valuable information for
mentors who communicate (chat) with learners to increase
social presence and prevent dropouts in online learning.
The primary limitation of this study was that all the
participants were undergraduate students at Japanese
universities. Thus, it is unclear whether the current findings
can be generalized to users of various ages from other
countries and cultural backgrounds. Finally, future work is
needed to examine in detail the role of various graphical
symbols (including stickers) collected in real online learning
environments, to propose ways of increasing learners’ social
presence and fostering their learning activities.
