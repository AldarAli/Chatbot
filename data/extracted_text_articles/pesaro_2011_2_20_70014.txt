Abstract—Autonomous aerospace launchers must carry out 
their missions safely because any accident can lead to 
important or dramatic consequences. It is essential to develop 
robust control solutions that guarantee optimal performances 
even when failures occur during these missions. The main 
objective of this paper is to present the development of a fault-
tolerant control design in the case of an aerospace launcher. 
The method consists of defining and carrying out effective 
procedures for early detection of some critical situations and 
providing an adequate control that maintains the safe 
behaviour of the launcher. The improved control performance 
is obtained by using a sliding mode observer for a robust 
reconstruction of an actuator fault. This reconstruction is used 
then to generate an added signal in the initial control law that 
compensates for the effect of the faults. Simulation results will 
show the efficiency of the proposed method.

 INTRODUCTION  
The conquest of space is a technological battle that began 
decades ago, spurring great interest in researchers. 
Automatic applications in this field play an important role, 
particularly in modeling, control, and diagnosis aspects.   
For the future needs of the CNES (The French Space 
Agency), it is useful to develop appropriate methodologies 
for piloting space vehicle launchers. 
This work is within the framework of the PERSEUS 
Project which is a technology development program, 
undertaken as part of the research and innovation policy of 
the CNES Launcher Directorate [1]. The PERSEUS project 
has three objectives: the search for innovation and the 
development of promising technology applicable to Space 
transport systems; the undertaking of this work by young 
people within a university or association context, in order to 
encourage them to choose a career in space; and finally, the 
development of a set of ground-based and flight 
demonstrators in order to draw up a detailed pre-project file 
of a system for launching nano satellites. 
Recently, some research in the Fault Detection and 
Isolation (FDI) area has led to systems based on the sliding 
mode idea [2], [3].  
Although uncertainties could reduce the effects of faults 
in the control system and may cause false alarms, undetected 
faults could cause catastrophic consequences. In this context, 
Tan and Edwards [4], in 2003, extended their results 
obtained in 2000 [5] to design a sliding mode observer 
(SMO) that minimizes the L2 gain between the uncertainty 
and the fault reconstruction signal to implement a robust 
faults reconstruction system.  
The objective of the tolerant control system is to keep a 
safe behaviour for the system even in the presence of faults. 
Almost all the existing methods in the literature are divided 
into two classes: passive and active [6]. Passive techniques 
deal with an expected set of failures on the actuator and lead 
to a controller design that makes the closed-loop system 
insensitive to certain faults. Theses methods may lead to a 
very complex controller especially when the number of 
possible failures increases. Moreover, when unexpected 
failures occur, the controller is not capable of stabilizing the 
system. Active techniques use an FDI system and a control 
reconfiguration procedure that takes into account the effect 
of the fault. Different approaches, as model matching and 
track trajectory have been developed to improve system 
performances when a fault occurs. 
This work improves the results described in an earlier 
article [7], where only a control scheme was developed on 
the launcher but where faults were not taken into account. 
The tolerant control developed here is based on the active 
technique. The FDI is built on results from [4] and [5] for a 
robust fault reconstruction. Unlike many previous active 
schemes found in the literature, the proposed method can be 
handled directly without completely reconfiguring the 
controller. A robust actuator fault reconstruction technique is 
applied to the process, allowing the compensation of the 
effect of the faults. The synthesis procedure is expressed in 
Linear Matrix Inequality terms.  
Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed 
fault tolerant scheme to detect actuator failures in real time,

identify them accurately with low computational overhead, 
and compensate for those actuator failures to achieve 
stability of the launcher around zero incidence. 
This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces 
the launcher model and its linear state representation. Section 
3 explains the strategy of the detection and control system. 
Section 4 gives the proposed sliding mode observer, and a 
robust reconstruction technique for actuator faults is 
developed in Section 6. Finally, the conclusion is given in 
Section 7.

SPACE LAUNCHER DESCRIPTION 
The launcher is assumed to be a rigid structure. 
Consequently, flexible modes are not considered in the 
launcher modeling but they may be taken into account as 
disturbances added to measures.

launcher system. These forces are as follows:   
 
- The gravity is given by

The aerodynamic force can be decomposed into two 
perpendicular forces:   
- RZ, the lift, is the component perpendicular to the 
trajectory; it is the most important force that carries the 
launcher:

The coefficients A6, K1, a1 and a2 are the system variables 
that make the launcher’s model non stationary and, therefore, 
difficult to control.  Typical curves describing the variation 
of these parameters are shown in Figure 2 [8]. Operating 
points are chosen.

where x(t)

p  is the output vector, 
t,u,y
 
k  includes 
uncertainties or perturbations affecting the system like the 
wind effect and  fa(t)  
q is the actuator faults vector. The 
system matrices A, B and M are defined in the previous 
Section .  F is the repartition matrix of faults. We assume

In order to eliminate the effect of the actuator fault, a new 
control law is added to the nominal one. Therefore, the

The additional control law

SLIDING MODE OBSERVER 
In the following work, a design method for a sliding mode 
observer for uncertain linear systems based methodology 
inspired from the work of Edwards and Spurgeon [10] is 
presented. The problem of a robust reconstruction of 
actuators faults can be implemented as shown on Figure 4.

Edwards, Spurgeon, and Patton [11] have shown that a

- invariant zeros of the system (A, F, C) are stable. 
 
If these conditions are satisfied, then there exists a

In Figure 5, the first two curves show the shape of the 
fault acting on the actuator at t = 7 seconds and its 
reconstruction. 
The 
third 
curve 
shows 
the 
fault 
reconstruction error. It can be seen that the fault fa(t) is 
faithfully   reconstructed.

The fault reconstruction is then used to determine the 
additional term uo(t) in the control law u(t) according to 
equation (18).  
 
Figure 6 shows the evolution of the launcher attitude in 
the normal case (blue curve) and the estimation of its attitude 
obtained by the SMO observer when a fault appears on the 
actuator (green curve). To avoid bending forces that can 
destabilize the launcher, it is important to keep its attitude 
around zero. It is clear that the control law rejects the fault 
effect and stabilizes the launcher attitude.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, an approach for a robust control system 
based on fault estimates obtained by reconstruction 
techniques is proposed for an aerospace launcher system. An 
SMO was used to reconstruct actuator faults. This approach 
is based on the minimization of the effect of uncertainty on 
the faults reconstructed signal by the minimization of 
the H
norm of the transfer matrix between the unknown 
inputs and the estimated actuator faults. A signal, built from 
the fault reconstruction, is then added to the control law and 
permitted the compensation of the fault effect. A numerical 
simulation example was provided to verify and validate the 
developed theoretical results. 
Further work will extend the approach to non linear 
models and will specifically consider the launcher 
parameters’ variations.
