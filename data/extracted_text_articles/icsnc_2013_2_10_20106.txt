Abstract—This paper presents evaluation results of coexistence 
between earth station of the fixed-satellite service and 
terrestrial fixed wireless system in 8 GHz band. The evaluation 
has been made based on a methodology and system 
characteristics assumed for analysis on frequency sharing basis. 
The result could be useful when new frequency allocation to 
the fixed-satellite service is considered in the frequency band to 
which the terrestrial fixed service is already allocated.

 INTRODUCTION  
Fixed-satellite service (FSS) is the official classification 
for communications using geostationary satellites that 
provide broadcast feeds to television stations, radio stations 
and broadcast networks. FSSs also transmit information for 
telephony, telecommunications and data communications [1]. 
In order to deploy a satellite network providing various 
services in a wide area as mentioned above, spectrum and 
orbit resources are essential. Since they are limited natural 
resources [2], it is very important to use them efficiently and 
economically.  
The frequency bands 7.25-7.75 GHz and 7.9-8.4 GHz are 
allocated worldwide to the FSS in the direction of space-to-
Earth and Earth-to-space, respectively. These bands or parts 
of them are also allocated worldwide to other services such 
as the fixed and mobile services, the meteorological-satellite 
service and the Earth exploration-satellite service (space-to-
Earth). These bands have been generally used for military or 
satellite imagery. At World Radiocommunication Conference 
held in 2012 (WRC-12), some countries reported a shortfall 
of spectrum available for their current and future applications 
in these bands. The additional bandwidth requirements for 
data transmission on these next-generation satellites were 
estimated around a maximum of 100 MHz. To meet the 
requiremets, it was decided that WRC-15 should consider 
possible new allocations to the FSS in the frequency bands 
7.15-7.25 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 8.4-8.5 GHz (Earth-to-
space). When considering any additional possible frequency 
allocations to any space services, compatibility studies to 
ensure adequate protection of terrestrial services as in [3]. 
This paper presents the possibility of coexistence between 
earth station of the FSS and terrestrial fixed wireless system 
(FWS) in the band 8.4-8.5 GHz. The evaluation has been 
made based on a methodology and system characteristics 
assumed for analysis on frequency sharing basis as presented 
in Section II. Section III analyzes the coexistence of the FSS 
earth station with the FWS based on the results of 
interference calculation. Finally, we provide our conclusion 
form the study results.

METHODOLOGY AND SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS

Gr (r): Antenna gain of FWS towards FSS earth station 
(dBi);  
 
r : 
  Angle between the main beam of FWS receive 
antenna and interference source (degrees); 
 
Lb ( p%): Path loss level not exceeded for p% time (dB). 
In order to evaluate if the received interference power 
density at the receiver of the FWS from the emission of FSS 
earth station can meet the protection criterion of the FWS, we 
calculated Lb (p %) and got the required protection distance 
between interfering FSS earth station and FWS receiver. The 
required protection distance is determined based on the 
propagation losses indicated in the methodology which is 
given in [4] which is widely used in similar studies as in [5]. 
If FSS in the Earth-to-space direction is to be introduced 
into bands already heavily used, aggregate interference 
impacts on the existing services in the bands should be 
considered as appropriate. I/N values for long-term 
interference of -6 dB or -10 dB, as appropriate, may be 
applicable where the risk of simultaneous interference from 
the stations of the other co-primary allocations is negligible 
and in other cases, a more stringent criterion may be required 
to account for aggregate interference from all interfering co-
primary services [6]. 
It is possible to apportion allowable interference in digital 
FWS to the FS, other services and other emissions 
respectively as 89 %, 10 % and 1 % of the total interference 
allowance [7]. Allowing 20 % degradation due to total 
interference, this means that the allowance for other 
co-primary services is 2 % of the error performance 
objectives. If only FSS is considered in the band, the FSS 
portion would then be 2 % of the error performance objective, 
leading to an allowable I/N of −17 dB. If another or two other 
co-primary service(s) is/are considered as co-primary 
service(s) in the band, the FSS portion would be 1 % or 
0.67 %, leading to an allowable I/N of -20 dB or -21.7 dB. 
B. System Characteristics for Interference Analysis 
Table I presents system characteristics of FSS earth 
station assumed for interference analysis in the study. We 
considered five types of FSS earth station for various 
applications in the FSS.  
We assumed antenna pattern for the FSS earth station as 
in Fig. 2. The earth stations of Type 1 to Type 4 have the 
same antenna pattern except for the maximum gain as given 
by (2) for D/ ≥ 50, where D is antenna diameter and is 
wavelength [8]. The earth station of Type 5 has a different 
pattern from the others, since the antenna pattern of Type 4 
was extended for D/ < 50 as given by (3) [9].

CALCULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF 
COEXISTENCE OF FSS EARTH STATOIN WITH FWS 
We calculated required Lb (p %) to meet the protection 
criteria of FWS taking into account for propagation model 
with flat terrain and time percentage, p of 20 % for long-term 
analysis and finally found the required protection distance 
creating the required Lb (20 %). Fig. 4 shows the calculated 
Lb (20 %) based on the system characteristics provided in the 
previous section. We assumed the average radio-refractive 
index lapse-rate through the lowest of the atmosphere ΔN = 
45 and the sea-level surface refractivity N0 = 310. The 
propagation mechanisms include tropospheric scatter, 
ducting, fade and gaseous absorption over the path between 
the location of emission and reception. 
 
Figure 4.  Calculation results of path loss vs. distance 
In Fig. 4, Case 1, to which Types 1 and 2 of the FSS earth 
station belong, shows slightly low path loss compared to 
Cases 2 and 3 on the distance below 100 km, while Cases 2 
and 3, to which Types 3 and 4 and Type 5 belong, 
respectively, show the same result. It implies that the antenna 
height of FSS earth station would be a dominant factor for 
the path loss. 
Based on the results given in Fig. 4, we could get the 
required distance to meet long-term interference level of 
terrestrial FWS from the emission of FSS earth station. Table 
III presents the calculation results of the required separation 
distance.  
The results of the static analysis shows that FSS earth 
station of all  types can be compatible with FWS if it would 
ensure the required protection distances from 79.8 km to 
261.5 km.   
It should be noted that the calculations were carried out 
for flat terrain not taking into account the actual path profile 
of the interfering signal. Since, in real situation, the 
interference will be additionally decreased due to natural and 
artificial obstacles, the required distance between FSS earth 
station and FWS will be less than the calculated results 
shown in Table III.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper addresses the feasibility of coexistence 
between transmitting FSS earth station and receiving 
terrestrial FWS in 8 GHz band. We calculated required 
separation distance of FSS earth station to meet the long-term 
interference level of FWS from interference path loss, taking 
into 
account 
interference 
methodology 
and 
system 
characteristics presented in the previous section.  
The results show that the required separation varies up to 
a few hundreds kilometers if all types of FSS earth station 
will be deployed. If we apply actual path profile for the 
calculation, the required distance could be reduced due to 
natural and artificial obstacles.  
Based on the results, we can select a certain type of FSS 
earth station for coexistence with terrestrial FWS, when we 
consider new frequency allocation to the FSS.
