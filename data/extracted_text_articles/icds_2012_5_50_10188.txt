Abstract— Even though the wireless coverage inside buildings 
is widely studied, there are many deployments that are not 
optimal. An accurate design, not only allows more radio 
coverage inside the building, but could allow cost savings if we 
are able to reduce the number of access points that are used to 
implement the solution. In this paper, we will show a research 
study about the optimum location of access points inside the 
building of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV) in 
order to provide better wireless Internet access to the students. 
The paper provides a comparative study for different Service 
Set Identifiers (SSIDs) (are currently available at the 
university). We will also compare them analytically. Finally we 
will obtain the mathematical expressions that allow us to model 
their behavior and we will see how the signals propagate 
following a very peculiar pattern.

 INTRODUCTION 
Today, wireless networks are widely used in companies 
and universities as a support to the wired network. These 
allow the user easy access to all services provided by the 
company’s network and usually allow Internet access. 
When attempting to develop indoor wireless networks, 
many problems arise such as losses due to the walls, 
refractions over objects arranged randomly on the site or 
losses due to the use of different types of construction 
materials that cause different types of losses (brick, metal, 
glass, etc.) [1, 2]. 
Moreover to these issues, we should add the fact that the 
building interiors are almost never uniform making it very 
difficult to foresee in advance exactly what is the radio 
coverage of the wireless network [3]. 
It is  necessary to have a correct and optimal design,  in 
order to offer multiple additional services such as indoor 
positioning, object location, object tracking, etc. [4]. 
Moreover wireless coverage systems are being studied in 
other research fields such as Wireless Sensor Networks 
(WSN) [5]. 
In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the wireless 
signals from access points (APs) located in the Centre of 
resources for the research and learning (CRAI) of The 
Polytechnic High School of Gandia, of the Polytechnic 
University of Valencia (UPV). The obtained measurements 
will allow us to know the received signal strength evolution 
in function of the distance to the APs. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
shows some related works about radio coverage. Section 3 
presents the scenario and the tools used to perform our 
measurements. Section 4 shows the result of the 
measurements in coverage maps. Section 5 makes a 
comparative study of the three analyzed signals on each 
floor. The analytical study and the equations which 
expressed this behavior are shown in Section 6. Finally, 
Section 7 shows the conclusion and future works. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
There have been many studies of wireless coverage, both 
empirically [6] and analytically [7]. Concretely, in [7], the 
authors performed an analytical study about the AP location 
and channel assignment. The treatment of these keys 
separately can lead to optimal designs. Authors propose an 
integrated model that addresses both aspects simultaneously 
in order to find a balance to optimize both objectives. 
M. Kamenetskyt et al. [8] examine the methods for 
obtaining a position close to the optimal entry points and 
evaluate their performance in a typical center or campus 
environment. System performance is evaluated by an 
objective function, which aims to maximize the coverage 
area and signal quality. The optimization algorithms used are 
a subjective function on a discrete search space, which 
significantly reduces the complexity inherent to the problem. 
Numerical results show that random search algorithms, can 
lead to good solutions. However, the convergence of 
simulated travel speed depends largely on the development 
of simulation parameters and a good parameters selection.  
Kaemarungsi and Krishnamurthy [4] studied the features 
of the IEEE 802.11-based WLANs and analyze the data in 
order to understand the underlying features of location 
fingerprints. They pointed out that the user’s presence should 
be taken into account when collecting the location fingerprint 
for user related location-based service. 
J. Lloret et al. [10, 11] showed studies about an empirical 
coverage radio model for indoor wireless LAN design. This 
model has been tested on a vast number of buildings of a 
great extension area with over 400 wireless APs in order to 
get the results successfully. The objective of the model is to 
facilitate the design of a wireless local area network WLAN 
using simple calculations, because the use of statistical 
methods takes too much time and it is difficult to implement 
in most situations. The proposed model is based on a 
derivation of the field equation of free propagation, and takes 
into account the structure of the building and its materials. 
Sendra et al. [12] presented a comparison of the IEEE 
802.11a/b/g/n variants in indoor environments in order to 
know which is the best technology. This comparison is made 
in terms of received signal strength indicator (RSSI), 
coverage area and measurements of interferences between 
channels.

SCENARIO DESCRIPTION AND USED TOOLS  
The CRAI was built in 2007. It belongs to the 
Polytechnic high school of Gandia. It has 3 floors, where 
different services for the students are offered. It contains the 
library, some computer labs and open access classrooms. 
Figure 1 shows the location of this space. It is the H building  
Now, we are going to describe the scenario where the 
measurements have taken from the wireless networks and the 
hardware and software used to perform our research. 
A. The building  
The ground floor (see Fig. 2) contains the information 
desk, staff offices, the library and a large study room with a 
consultation area and several classrooms for group study. 
There is a multipurpose room where events and exhibitions 
are sometimes held. 
On the first floor (see Fig. 3) we can find several 
computer labs, classrooms to perform Final Degree Projects, 
group study rooms and individual study rooms. 
The second floor (see Fig. 4) has the magazine and 
journal library, the video library, some computer labs and 
some professor offices. 
B. Description of UPV Wireless Network 
Polytechnic high school of Gandia is a campus of the 
UPV and shares the 4 networks with the main campus: 
EDUROAM, UPVNET2G, UPVNET and UPV-INFO. Each 
one of these allows the university users to access Internet and 
the university resources. 
 
UPVNET: Wireless network with direct connection to 
all the resources of the UPV. It requires a wireless card 
with Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi 
Protected Access II (WPA2). 
 
UPVNET2G: Direct network connection to all resources 
of the UPV and the Internet. It requires a wireless card 
with WPA/WPA2. 
 
EDUROAM: This wireless network is widely deployed 
in universities and research centers in Europe. It 
provides internet access to all of their members. The 
users need the user name and password of their home 
institution. It requires a wireless card with WPA/WPA2. 
EDUROAM only provides Internet access. 
 
UPV-INFO: This wireless network is designed to 
provide information about how the wireless network 
should be configured. It uses private IP addressing and it 
does not allow Internet access. A second connection is 
needed to access Internet and UPV resources. This 
second connection is a Virtual Private Networking 
(VPN). It should only be used by very old computers 
that do not support WPA encryption. 
In this paper, we will analyze three of these networks. 
They are UPVNET, UPVNET2G, EDUROAM. 
C. Used software and hardware 
In order to carry out this work, several measurements 
have been done along the three floors of the CRAI. We have 
used different network devices to perform the measurements: 
 
Linksys WUSB600N [13]: Is a USB wireless device that 
was used to gather the measurements. It is able to 
capture signals from the IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n variants. Its 
power transmission is 16 dBm for all variants and the 
receiver sensitivity is about -91dBm in both internal 
antennas. The transmission power consumption is less 
122

than 480mA and it consumes 300mA in the reception 
mode.  
 
Laptop: It was used to take the coverage measurements. 
It has a dual core processor with 2 GHz per core and 2 
Gbyte of RAM Memory. It has Windows Vista. 
 
Cisco Aironet 1130AG (AIR-AP1131AG-E-K9) [14]: 
This AP is used in all floors of the building. Its data rate 
can reach up to 54 Mbps. It can work at 2.4 GHz or 5 
GHz, with a maximum distance between 100m to 122m 
indoors (as a function of the IEEE 802.11a or IEEE 
802.11g variant). The maximum distance for outdoor 
environments, is between 198 m to 274 m. It can be 
powered by PoE (Power over Ethernet). 
In order to capture the received signal at each point of the 
building, we used the following program: 
 
InSSIDer [15]: Is a free software tool that detects and 
controls the wireless networks and the signal strength in 
a graphical way. This program lists all detected wireless 
networks and provides their details as Service Set 
Identifier (SSID), Media Access Control address (MAC 
address), channel, RSSI, network type, security, speed 
and intensity of the signal and also allows the control of 
the quality of the signal. 
IV. 
COVERAGE RESULTS 
We have measured the walking area, where students and 
university staff can access. Bathrooms, exterior stairways, 
storage, etc are excluded. In order to perform this work, a 
grid of 4 meters x 4 meters has been drawn in each floor. 
This allows us to make measurements of the different 
networks in the same places. The laptop was located at a 
height of 100 cm above the ground. 
A. Ground floor 
This subsection shows the signal coverage measured on 
the ground floor. There are 5 APs that cover the entire plant. 
There are four places with the highest coverage level (the 
values are higher than -50 dBm). We highlight 2 rooms, 
Room A, the multipurpose room, and Room B, the computer 
room (see Figs. 5, 6, and 7). The AP located outside the wall 
of the computer room provides coverage levels below -70 
dBm inside the classroom for all three cases. 
Fig. 5 shows the coverage area and levels of UPVNET 
wireless network at the ground floor. Room A presents 
signal strength of -90 dBm due to the signal attenuation 
generated when crossing several walls.  
Fig. 6 shows the coverage area for the UPVNET2G 
wireless network on the ground floor. Three places with 
higher signal strengths than -50 dBm can be seen. These 
places correspond to the location of APs. The multipurpose 
room has a very low coverage on the left side because the 
signal is greatly attenuated because it crosses several walls. 
Fig. 7 shows the value of signal strength for EDUROAM 
wireless network on the ground floor. Again, there are three 
places with the high signal strength in excess -50 dBm, 
which correspond to the location of APs. In this case, more 
than half of the room B has signal strength levels below -
70dBm. 
B. First floor 
This subsection shows the signal strength measured on 
the first floor. In this case, there are 4 APs that cover the 
entire plant. There are 4 places with the highest signal 
strength (higher than -50dBm). 
Fig. 8 shows the signal strength for UPVNET wireless 
network on the first floor. The rooms at the left side have 
low radio coverage because the AP is not located in the 
correct place. The offices at the right side have also very 
poor signal strength because they are very close to the stairs 
and they suffer signal attenuation rather important.  
Fig. 9 shows the UPVNET2G wireless network signal 
strength on the first floor. We can see that in the classroom 
on the left hand is not well covered because of the AP 
position. It is located on the right hand of the wall. The 
offices from the bottom right also have very poor coverage, 
because they are very close to the stairs, which generate 
significant signal attenuation. 
Fig. 10 shows the EDUROAM signal strength on the 
first floor. In this case, we can see the same effect as in the 
other cases, but, moreover, there are tables in the study area 
(center of the picture), with a low signal strength (lower 
than -90 dBm). 
C. Second floor. 
This subsection shows the signal strength measured on 
the second floor. The floor is covered by 4 APs. They offer a 
good coverage across most of the surface. 
Fig. 11 shows the signal strength for UPVNET wireless 
network on the second floor. In this floor, there is good 
radio coverage across the whole plant. 
Fig. 12 shows the signal strength of UPVNET2G on the 
second floor. This signal is correctly broadcasted through the 
floor and its signal strength levels are sufficient to cover the 
working places.  
Fig. 13 shows the signal strength of EDUROAM 
wireless network on the second floor. The signal on this 
floor is very good. 
After having analyzed the radio coverage images, it is 
easy to see that the behavior of the signal strengths for each 
floor is quite similar, with small variations. The received 
signal strength is very low in bathrooms and toilets. This is 
because the amount of water pipes and copper tubes in the 
walls which produce the signal attenuation. We have also 
found low signal strength levels in the stairwells. The stairs 
usually have metal framework and a foundation which 
prevents the spreading of the signal. 
V. 
COMPARATIVE STUDY 
In this section, we compare the signals of the same plant. 
Fig. 14 shows the three signals from the ground floor. 
UPVNET2G provides better signal strength levels than 
UPVNET and EDUROAM. Signal strengths from the first 
floor are shown in Fig. 15. UPVNET2G is the network that 
presents the highest signal strengths. UPVNET and 
EDUROAM have similar behavior although there are some 
points where EDUROAM signal is better.

Figure 12.  Radio coverage map of the second floor for UPVNET2G 
Fig. 16 shows the behavior of signal strengths of the 
second floor. UPVNET2G and EDUROAM have identical 
behavior from 3 meters to around 10 meters, but from 0 to 3 
meters and 10 meters to 12 meters, EDUROAM signal 
strength is better. The lowest signal strength is presented by 
UPVNET all the time. Keeping in mind all graphs, it is easy 
to conclude that the wireless network that provides the best 
signal strength level is UPVNET2G.  
VI. 
ANALYTICAL STUDY 
After analyzing the above figures, we can estimate the 
behavior of the wireless signals in indoor environments. 
Therefore, this section shows how the signal strength varies 
depending on the distance to the AP.

Figure 15.  Signal strength on the first floor. 
 
Figure 16.  Signal strength on the second floor. 
The analytical study is performed for three networks 
(UPVNET, UPVNET2G and EDUROAM). In order to draw 
each one of these graphs, we have estimated the average 
value of the three signals provided by each wireless network. 
Fig. 17 shows the average value of the signal strength 
depending on the distance to the AP on the ground floor. 
Expression 1 shows the equation for the trend line (black line 
in Fig. 17) of our measurements. As we can see, it is a 
polynomial expression of fifth grade, with a correlation 
coefficient of R2=1. However, we can appreciate a slight 
difference between them in positions close to 3-4 meters, and 
further away than 17 meters of the APs. 
Y=-0.0001x5+0.0066x4-0.1078x3+0.6889x2-2.3012x-54.75

where Y represents the average value of the received signal 
strength in dBm and X is the distance in meters to the AP. 
Fig. 18 shows the average signal strength provided by the 
APs located on the first floor, as a function of the distance to 
the APs. In positions further than 8 meters of the APs, both 
graphs vary very few between them, although the rest of the 
graph is identical. Equation 2 shows the expression for the 
trend line (black line in Fig. 18) of our measurements. The 
behavior of wireless signals based on the distance is 
described by a cubic polynomial with a correlation 
coefficient of R2=1.  
 
Y=-0.0117x3+0.0665x2-3.9909x-46.833

where Y is the signal level in dBm and X is the distance in 
meters to the AP. 
In Fig. 19, provides the behavior of the signal level on 
the second floor. Equation 3 shows the trend line (black line 
in Fig. 19) of our measurements. In this case equation 3 is a 
3rd degree polynomial with a correlation coefficient of R2=1. 
It shows that both graphs have a nearly perfect match, as its 
correlation coefficient shows.

where Y is the average signal value in dBm and X is the 
distance in meters to the AP. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
When the deployment of a wireless network on the inside 
a building is needed to offer complete coverage for all the 
users, we should pay particular attention to the correct 
placement of the AP. We have analyzed the behavior of the 
signal strengths of the APs located in the CRAI. The 
measurements provided have enabled us to represent the 
signal evolution depending on the distance to the AP.

With these measurements of the coverage maps of each 
floor, have been drawn the pictures processed for this 
analysis have allowed us to determine the places where the 
signal is not good (less than -70 dBm), and so relocate APs 
and add more, if it was needed. With all of these, we have 
performed an analytical and comparative study, with the 
three networks. After this study, we can see that, the 
EDUROAM and UPVNET have very similar coverage, 
while UPVNET2G is a little bit better. This phenomenon is a 
strange because the same APs give the coverage for the 3 
wireless networks. Moreover, we have detected that the 
worst designed floor was the ground floor (in terms of APs 
distribution). We propose the relocation of some of the 
existent APs and to add new APs to cover the shadow areas 
where the signal strength is below than levels appropriate for 
Internet access. 
We have characterized mathematically, the behavior of 
the signal strength in each floor. In all cases, the behavior 
can be expressed by a polynomial expression of degree equal 
to or greater than 3, depending on each floor. The APs of the 
CRAI building give acceptable radio coverage levels up to 
16 meters from the AP's position. 
On the other hand, we have estimated the average value 
for all floors, depending on the distance to the APs and we 
see that it could be modeled as a fifth degree polynomial 
with a correlation coefficient of 1. It is shown in equation 4. 
The signal strength Y is given in dBm and X the distance to 
the AP, in meters. 
Y=4·10-5x5-0.0024x4+0.0455x3-0.2065x2-1.966x-50.792
Finally, we have observed a trend in the signal behavior 
where it reduces its strength in a staggered manner (as we 
see clearly in Fig.14 and 17). In all other plants, this behavior 
is less visible. However, due to new tests that we are 
carrying out in other buildings, it seems that this pattern is 
repeated.  
We are now working on the design to place more than 
one AP in the same location in order to provide higher 
bandwidths for the students. Moreover, we are proposing the 
use of APs in standby mode to provide fault tolerance. 
Finally, APs should be updated to IEEE 802.11n standard in 
order to achieve higher speeds and greater distances.
