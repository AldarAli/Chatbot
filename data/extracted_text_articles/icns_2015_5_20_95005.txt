Abstract— This paper proposes a time diversity based iterative 
frequency estimation scheme with low signal to noise ratio 
(SNR) for pulse Doppler radar based on weighted average. The 
conventional estimator can alleviate the effect of a diffused 
Doppler frequency. By applying a weighted average scheme to 
the received signal, the proposed algorithm improves the 
accuracy of the frequency estimation. The proposed estimator 
has better performance than the conventional estimators. Not 
only is the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) derived but also 
the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and 
verified through Monte-Carlo simulations in an additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN). 
Keywords- time diversity; iterative frequency estimation; 
weighted average scheme; pulse Doppler radar. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Doppler frequency estimation (DFE) algorithms are 
related to the estimation of sinusoidal waveforms in various 
applications such as radar and communication. Maximum 
likelihood (ML) based estimation [1], discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT) based algorithms [2][3], adaptive notch 
filters, the different least mean square error technique [4], 
and Kalman filters [5] are just some of the most important 
methods developed for frequency estimations of noisy 
sinusoids. Furthermore, the estimation of the frequency of a 
sinusoid is usually performed using a two-step method 
containing a coarse estimation and a fine search [6][7]. These 
fine search estimations have variances similar to that of the 
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) but nonetheless still show 
frequency-dependent 
performance. 
Iterative 
frequency 
estimation (IFE) [7] which is the state-of-the-art in 
estimation problem allows equal performance to be 
accomplished independent of the true signal frequency and 
the estimation accuracy to be improved.  
In practical applications, for pulse Doppler radar signals 
with low signal to noise ratio (SNR), unavoidably, the 
Doppler frequency is quite diffused and very difficult to 
estimate. In order to solve the Doppler frequency problem 
with low SNR, we propose a weighted average for the 
iterative frequency estimation (WAIFE) which can alleviate 
the drawbacks to a certain extent. 
This paper is organized as follows. The system model of 
the pulse-Doppler radar is presented in Section II. We 
describe the proposed WAIFE algorithm in Section III. To 
validate the proposed algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulations 
are provided in Section IV. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in 
Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
We consider the pulse signals used for pulse-Doppler 
radar [8]. We consider these pulse signals, including the 
Doppler frequency, in order to extract the velocity of an 
object. For convenience of explaining the proposed concept, 
the radar signal is simply assumed to be composed of only N 
pulse repetition intervals (PRIs) during an M update time.  
The radar signal, composed of only N PRI, is simply 
transmitted such that

At this point, the Doppler shift is estimated through an 
iterative method based on the DFE. The received signals rj(t)

Assuming that the received signals are sampled at a rate 
of fs =1/Ts, the received N (TPRI=Ts) samples r(nTs), n=0,…,N-

We also assume that the baseband signal is sampled at the

fdn,j is defined in terms of the Doppler frequency fd,j such that 
fdn,j = fd,j / fs = v/N during the j-th update time, where N 
represents the number of samples. The number v is composed 
of kp,j and δ, which are the integer part and the fractional part 
of the j-th update time, respectively. 
III. 
WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOR AN ITERATIVE FREQUENCY 
ESTIMATION (WAIFE) 
In this section, we depict how the WAIFE is employed for 
the DFE of the received signal with time diversity and how 
the proposed estimator combines the IFE with a weighted-
average scheme by considering the power of the received 
signal. 
A. Iterative Frequency Estimation 
From (3), the IFE is achieved in three steps during the j-
th update time. The integer part kmax,j is initially estimated 
from the index of the periodogram of the received signal; 
then, by conducting the first iterative scheme, the fractional 
part δj,1 is estimated using the values of the periodogram at 
the appropriate frequencies. In the third step, the estimation 
of the fractional part δj,2 is also iteratively achieved from the 
results of the periodogram using the previous integer kmax,j 
and the fractional part δj,1. The frequency corresponding to 
the maximum DFT amplitude coefficient is chosen as a 
frequency approximation of the ML estimate. We define 
DFT such that

B. Weighted-Average Algorithm 
In practical applications with a low SNR, unavoidably, 
the Doppler frequency cannot be obtained accurately because 
it is diffused. To deal with this problem, the WAIFE 
considers the time diversity in the DFE. Through [9], when 
the Doppler frequency is slowly varied, the WAIFE precisely 
estimates the smoothed Doppler frequency. From (10), let ˆ
j
δ  
(j= 0, 1, . . . , M-1) and ˆ jp  denote the fractional part of the 
Doppler frequency and the received power during the j-th 
update time, respectively. Because the received signal with a 
good SNR is weighted, the WAIFE shows better 
performance.  
To estimate a frequency that is contaminated with 
noise, the weighted-average Doppler frequency is 
expressed using

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
In this section, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 
the CRLB for the proposed WAIFE are derived. For an 
arbitrary fdn,j during the j-th update time, the RMSE of the 
iterative algorithm used for DFE was analyzed in earlier 
work [7] when the number of iterations is one in an AWGN 
channel. The RMSE of the proposed WAIFE is derived such 
that

where the received power ˆ j

signal-to-noise ratio. 
According to the CRLB, the DFE is based on the 
frequency estimation for the transformed sinusoid of the 
Doppler frequency. For the Doppler frequency signal of (3) 
in the AWGN channel from earlier research [10], the CRLB 
for the DFE is derived such that

SIMULATION RESULTS 
We present Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the 
Doppler frequency estimation performance of WAIFE. We

with L=1,000. In 
the following simulations, we normally adopt a pulse-
Doppler radar system as the setup with M=5, fs=1, and 
N=1,024, and we assume that there is one moving source. 
Fig. 1 shows the RMSE values of various instances of δ in 
the proposed and in conventional estimators. Here, SNR = 
0dB and N=1024 is used for practical situations of the 
proposed and conventional estimators. Compared to the ML 
estimator and the IFE with q=1, the proposed estimator has 
better RMSE performance than the conventional estimation 
such as [7] by more than about 40 times. Specifically, the 
proposed estimator shows performance similar to that of the 
CRLB at approximately -0.3 < δ < 0.3. 
Fig. 2 presents the performance results for various 
estimators when δ =0.3. We compare our algorithm with the 
IFE and the ML methods. Fig. 2 shows that our algorithm is 
capable of much better Doppler frequency estimation 
performance and that the performance is very close to that of 
the CRLB. The proposed estimator shows that the analyzed 
and the simulated performances are in good agreement from 
approximately SNR=-13dB. Fig. 3 shows the RMSE of 
various estimators according to an increase in the FFT size N. 
When N increases, the RMSEs of the proposed estimator, the 
ML and the IFE is improved. In particular, with the proposed 
estimator, when N changes from 256 to 4,096, the RMSE 
characteristics improve by more than 60 times, with a change 
from 5.4e-5 to 8.6e-7. From Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, the proposed 
estimation improves the estimation performance through the 
strong evaluation compared with the conventional estimation.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed a WAIFE algorithm which 
improved the estimation performance of diffused Doppler 
frequencies 
in 
pulse-Doppler 
radar. 
Compared 
to 
conventional algorithms, our algorithm provided much better 
performance for the DFE and was capable of performance 
very close to that of the CRLB. The proposed algorithm 
worked well with other FFT sizes of N. At -0.3< δ <0.3, the 
proposed estimator showed performance similar to that of 
the CRLB. In the future, the proposed estimator can be 
applied to various surveillance and safety systems based on 
pulse-Doppler radar that require good performance levels.
