Abstract— Final assembly at Krones AG must make the best 
possible use of its production space, and meeting the specified 
customer due dates is critical. Via a self developed simulation 
tool, the present scheduling procedure is compared with the 
one by priority rule shortest slack. As a consequence slack 
should have a higher importance in the planning. 
Keywords- Simulation of scheduling; unused area; tardiness.

 INTRODUCTION 
At Krones AG, the world market leader in the beverage 
industry, orders with very large area requirements have to be 
produced. Despite very high investments in suitable halls, the 
available area is a major bottleneck. This is also the case for 
other companies. 
Despite the use of planners, at least 21% of orders at 
Krones have consistently been late in recent years. Delays 
result in significant penalties and undermine the goal of 
getting every plant up and running on time. For many orders, 
delays were only avoided because process accelerations were 
made in the mostly long production processes through 
measures such as overtime. 
Krones now wanted to know more precisely:  
- How good is the actual quality of planning?  
- How good is planning that (primarily) follows due dates? 
Due to the improvement of planning within the 
production execution, the production result are not 
representative of the planning quality in terms of meeting 
due dates. Therefore, these questions should be answered by 
a simulation study. 
This article is structured as follows. In section 2, the 
previous planning procedure at Krones is explained and 
section 3 contains the relevant literature. In section 4 the self-
developed simulation tool is explained. Section 5 contains an 
analysis of the simulation results. Finally, in section 6, a 
summary is given and planned further work is described. 
II. 
PRODUCTION AND PLANNING AT KRONES AG 
Krones AG, headquartered in Neutraubling, Germany, 
employs around 15,000 people worldwide. It has been 
producing components, lines and systems for beverages and 
liquid food since 1951. It is assigned to the machinery and 
plant engineering sector, and it is a leading manufacturer in 
packaging and filling technology. The company covers every 
step of the production process, from product and container 
manufacturing, through filling and packaging, to material 
flow and container recycling. One of the last steps is the final 
assembly of filling machines in plant hall 5. 
The following description of the assembly serves to 
illustrate the area requirements, which can increase and 
decrease over time. At the same time, it mentions technical 
restrictions due to which processing times are not known in 
advance and are constant. 
Only one machine at a time can enter or leave the plant 
hall through the plant gates. Before starting the final 
assembly of a machine, a final assembly station with 
sufficient area is determined depending on the machine size. 
For example, in Figure 1, three fillers are to be assembled. 
Such a hall allocation is representative for the entire plant. 
All subassembly parts and materials of all machines are 
delivered to the delivery spots (i.e., "delivery spot" in Figure 
1). Materials from different machines and assemblies can be 
mixed here; indicated by "Assembly" in Figure 1. These 
outdoor delivery areas are limited, but can be used by any 
type of machine and material.  
The sub-assemblies and materials are divided into two 
groups of master material types. The first group of 
assemblies, due to design and/or weight, can only be lifted 
into the factory facility with the main crane (in Figure 1, 
materials with solid border lines). Mostly these parts are 
main machine parts. The second group of materials can be 
brought to their target material location by operators (in 
Figure 1 materials with dashed border lines). These are 
assembly parts sorted in trolleys or bins. These parts can be 
lifted by auxiliary cranes to their final place in the machine 
and are assigned to a single machine in the inside material 
place. These indoor material spots are physically fixed 
according to the final assembly station and are individual for 
each machine with materials. 
Final assembly stations are physically fixed and are 
individual for each machine with materials. After completion 
of the final assembly process, the finished machine can only 
be transported out of the hall by the main crane. The main 
crane and the outrigger cranes operate at different levels so 
that blocking is not possible. Support cranes are divided 
between the right and left sides of the plant and cannot pass 
each other on either side.  
Due to this area demand and the large dimensions of the 
assembled machines with diameters from 1.0 m to 7.2 m, 
plant hall 5 has an overall length of 105 m and a width of 30 
m and the area usable for assembly consists of 2208 m².

technology. 
 
In 2020, 145 machines were assembled and a higher 
number is expected in the next few years. The processing 
time of the assembly orders varies between 6 weeks and 19 
weeks with a mean value of 10.24 weeks and a deviation of 
2.5 weeks. At the end of a week, the plants leave the hall.  
Planning is done, as is standard for companies, by 
configuring the SAP system specifically for Krones AG. Its 
main components are listed in Figure 2. Its main service is 
ensuring the availability of materials. As analysed in the 
literature, e.g., [9], this planning provides insufficient results 
when taking into account the limited capacity. Just very 
simple procedures are used; which are listed in Figure 2. As 
discussed in the literature, e.g., [1], [3], [8], [9] and [11], 
scheduling is needed as an additional planning procedure 
between capacity planning and manufacturing execution.  
In principle, scheduling of the assembly orders of the hall 
at Krones is currently carried out by means of the following 
procedure: 
Planning is performed always at the beginning of a week. 
The worklist covers 12 weeks. This worklist is the result of 
the capacity planning by the SAP system, which is executed 
every day. At the beginning of each week, a machine can be 
allocated into the hall, provided that the necessary area is 
available, without having to reposition the machines already 
in the hall. A planner uses a printed layout of the plant hall in 
which the previously scheduled lines are drawn. The plant 
data, such as length, width, (customer) due date, are located 
in Krones' SAP system.  
Due to planning by the SAP system, the worklist is 
already ordered. A planner schedules the machines into the 
hall according to this list, provided availability is assured. 
The SAP system provides an order list (or machine list) for 
each day. The SAP system does not determine a sequence 
between the orders of a single day. A planner orders the 
machines of such a day. For this, she/he prefers larger 
required area or processing time over smaller ones. This 
follows the assumption that smaller machines, in terms of 
space requirements and/or processing times, can be more 
easily planned into a partially occupied hall than larger ones.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
  According to the literature and the 
experience of planner in companies, 
there is a conflict of objectives 
between minimizing the unused 
area, minimizing the number of 
workers, 
and 
minimizing 
the 
tardiness; as seen in the scheduling 
trilemma; see also [8]. 
Figure 3: Trilemma 
In the literature there are numerous works on scheduling as 
in [8] or [11] and on layout planning as in [2] or [4]. In 
combinations of both problems, either scheduling or layout 
planning dominates. An example is project planning for 
ships in [5] and [6] where well-used spatial layout is most 
important. The class of problem considered here consists not 
of projects, but of independent individual assembly orders. 
The proceedings of the annual winter simulation 
conferences contain many articles on simulation that are 
relevant to this work. Particularly relevant for this research 
work were [13] and the description of a process simulation as 
part of modelling in [12]. 
The real application operates in dynamic environments 
where real time events like station failure, tool breakage, 
arrival of new orders with high priority, changes of due dates 
etc., may turn a feasible schedule into an infeasible one; 
examples can be found in [8] and [11]. A feasible schedule 
of jobs is achieved by a priority rule like Earliest Due Date 
(EDD), because a priority rule orders a queue of jobs in front 
of a station quasi immediately; for its description and the one 
of other widely used priority rules see [3]. Thus, priority 
rules are still analysed in many studies on scheduling; one 
example of a recent one is [10] and [1].  
In addition to this facts, priority rules are also a first 
choice in the case of complex scheduling problems; 
especially in industrial practice. Thus, in [14] for a complex 
scheduling problem the performance of priority rules is

analysed. Another example is the application of priority rules 
for the dispatching of AGVs in flexible job shops in [7]. It 
might be that in the near future several such problems will be 
solved by more sophisticated heuristics as genetic algorithms 
for example. 
IV. 
SIMULATION TOOL 
For the simulation study, common commercially 
available simulation tools such as Plant Simulation from 
Siemens were first evaluated against a proprietary 
development. The tools allow extensive visualisations of the 
processes. However, they cannot significantly reduce the 
development effort required to control the scheduling of 
randomly arriving customer orders in the factory hall 
compared to an in-house development.  
A tool is developed to simulate and analyse various 
sequences of assembling filling machines in plant hall 5. It is 
implemented in Excel (in VBA) and one Excel sheet 
represents an allocation of plant hall 5. The hall is 
represented in Excel by a rectangle of cells, where each cell 
represents an area over 1m² in the plant hall. An assignment 
of 0 means an unused area (over 1m²) and a 1 means an 
allocation by a machine; other areas, such as those of 
passageways, office area, etc., are coded in Excel by 80. The 
total area required by a filling machine is then a rectangle of 
1-s in an Excel sheet. A sequence simulation creates such a 
sheet for each week (period) of the simulation horizon. It 
ends if the last machine of a set of orders, called workload, 
which is known at the beginning of the simulation run, has 
been assembled. 
For a sequence of orders elaborated by a planner or by 
the slack rule, the machines (orders) are iteratively assigned 
to plant hall 5 as follows. For an order (i.e., machine), the 
production area is searched from left to right and then from 
top to bottom until a sufficiently large free area is found. 
This area must also be free in the coming periods, as 
scheduling sequences are usually not sorted by release date. 
In the positive case, the allocation takes place, as far left-up 
as possible. In the negative case, this allocation attempt is 
repeated as soon as a machine is assembled and has left the 
hall; this could just happen at the of a week (period). 
After a successful simulation run, for each order its 
tardiness (actual completion date minus due date) and for 
each period the occupied area (or free area) are calculated. 
V. 
RESULTS 
The basis for the simulation experiments is the order data 
in 2020. The direct use of these data resulted in a very high 
standard deviation of mean tardiness and other key figures 
named below and used in the analysis. As a result, it was not 
possible to identify statistically significant results.   
In order to obtain meaningful results, the sequence of 
incoming orders over all weeks was examined more closely. 
It shows that there are periods in which the due dates can 
easily be met because the time available for processing (i.e., 
due date minus release date) is high compared to the net 
processing time.  In contrast, in other periods this ratio 
(quotient) of available time and net processing time is closer 
to one or even less than one (and thus critical); note: in the 
first case this quotient is significantly higher than 1.

On the basis of this analysis, two classes of workloads 
were created. Each consists of a high number of sets of 
orders.  Each of them is planned by a planner and by the 
slack rule. The key figures shown in Table 1 are calculated 
for all sets of orders. Both workloads have the same key 
figures for the due dates. Therefore, higher processing times

As said earlier, a planner prefers larger required area or 
processing time over smaller ones. Meeting due dates is thus 
only implicitly relevant in the best case. A detailed analysis 
of the individual plans shows: Responsible for the 
differences is that a planner prefers area requirements over 
tardiness avoidance. This is more likely to be the case with 
sets of orders causing high time pressure. Conversely, there 
are situations in which the planner achieves better results 
because she/he achieves faster processing of orders through 
better utilisation of plant hall 5. Note: the figures for the 
mean free area are based on makespan. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Scheduling in the literature mainly considers a 
bottleneck, such as the limited capacity of the machines. 
Requirements for the use of limited area for the assembly of 
machines is dealt with in other publications. Responsible for 
this are different approaches to these two problem classes. 
For the final assembly at Krones AG, both planning 
problems have to be considered simultaneously. Two 
experienced planners are used for this purpose. A simulation 
tool was developed to analyse the possibilities for 
improvements. The simulation experiments so far show that 
planners often find a good balance between using the limited 
area and avoiding tardiness. In situations with high time 
pressure, a preference for meeting due dates will already 
provide better results through the slack rule. The two 
planners are therefore encouraged to consider an allocation 
decision through slack. The two planners are therefore 
encouraged to consider an allocation decision through slack. 
The results so far show a significant difference in the use 
of free areas. Therefore, combinations of priority rules to 
meet due dates with rules to avoid unused areas are to be 
designed and simulatively investigated.
