microelectrode model to cell biometry experiments is proposed, 
using the cell-electrode area overlap as main parameter. The 
model can be applied to cell size identification, cell count, and 
their extension to cell growth and dosimetry protocols. 
Experimental results using AA8 cell line are presented, 
obtaining promising results.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Many biological parameters and processes can be sensed 
and monitored using its impedance as marker [1-5], with the 
advantage of being a non-invasive and relatively cheap 
technique. Cell growth and activity, changes in cell 
composition and shape, or in cell location are examples of how  
processes can be detected with microelectrode-cell impedance 
sensors [6-9]. Among Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) techniques, 
Electrical Cell-substrate  Impedance Spectroscopy (ECIS) 
[7,8], based on two-electrode setups, allows the measure of 
cell-culture impedances and the definition of the biological 
nature (material, internal activity, motility and size) of a kind of 
cell and its relationship with the environment [11]. One of the 
drawbacks of ECIS technique is the need of efficient models to 
decode the full system electrical performance composed by the 
electrodes, medium and cells. Several works have been 
developped in this field. In [8], magnitude and phase 
impedance are deduced from electric field equation solution at 
the cell-electrode interface, giving a three parameter based 
model. h, the cell-electrode distance, Rb, cell-to-cell barrier 
resistance and rcell, cell radius. In [9,10], finite element 
simulation (FEM) are executed to solve electrical field 
considering the whole structure. This method gives one 
parameter model (Rgap) to describe the gap or cell-electrode 
region resistance. In both, the model considers cells are in 
confluent phase [7] or a fixed area over the electrode [9]. The 
latest was extended in [10] to several cell sizes, allowing to 
define the cell-electrode covered area as the main model 
parameter. In this work is considered a model extension of Rgap 
based model, to incorporate the variable cell-microelectrode 
area overlap [10]. Impedance sensor sensitivity curves based on 
the cell size and density will be presented and applied to 
measure the growth-tax in cell-cultures and to describe cell 
toxicity experiments. 
In this paper, section II resumes the electrode solution 
model for cell-electrode characterization. The process to extract 
practical models is included at section III, illustrating the 
simulations on a simplified system leading to cell size 
detection. Section IV relies on real time cell culture monitoring 
and its applicarion to dosimetry experiments. Conclusions will 
be highlighted at section V. 
II. ELECTRODE-ELECTROLYTE MODEL 
The impedance of electrodes in ionic liquids has been rather 
extensively investigated. An excellent review can be found at 
[6]. The main componets describing the electrical performance 
of an electrode metal inside a solution are four: the double layer 
capacitance, CI, the current flowing through the electrified 
interface will encounter a resistance Rct caused by the electron 
transfer at the electrode surface and Warburg impedance ZW 
due to limited mass diffusion from the electrode surface to the 
solution. The electron transfer resistance Rct is in series with 
the mass diffusion limited impedance ZW. As the current 
spreads out to the bulk solution, the electrode has a solution 
conductivity determined by series resistance, represented as 
spreading resistance RS in the equivalent circuit. These four 
parameters depends on technology, medium and geometry. 
 
Figure 1.  Equivalent circuit of electrode-solution interface. CI is the 
double layer capacitance. Faradic impedance includes Zw, the Warburg 
impedance and Rct, the charge-transfer resistance. Rs is the spreading 
resistance. 
III. CELL-ELECTRODE MODEL 
The Fig. 2 illustrates a two-electrode impedance sensor 
useful for ECIS technique: e1 is the sensing electrode and e2 the 
reference one. Electrodes can be manufactured in CMOS 
process with metal layers [9] or using post-processing steps 
[13]. The cell location and size on e1 top must be detected. 
The model in Fig. 3 considers the sensing surface of e1 
could be total or partially filled by cells. For the two-electrode 
sensor in Fig. 2, e1 is the sensing area A, Z( ) is the impedance 
by unit area of the empty electrode (without cells on top). 
When e1 is partially covered by cells in a surface Ac, Z( )/(A-
Ac) is the electrode impedance associated to non-covered area 
by cells, and Z( )/Ac the impedance of the covered area. Rgap 
models the current flowing laterally in the electrode-cell 
interface, which depends on the electrode-cell distance at the 
interface (in the range of 15-150nm). Rs is the spreading 
resistance through the conductive solution. For an empty 
electrode, the impedance model Z( ) is represented by the 
circuit in Fig. 1. It has been considered for e2 the model in Fig 
3a, not covered by cells. The e2 electrode is commonly large

and ground connected, being its resistance small enough to be 
rejected. Figure 4 represents the impedance magnitude, Zc, for 
the sensor system in Fig. 2, considering that e1 could be either 
empty, partially or totally covered by cells. The parameter ff, 
called fill factor, can be zero for Ac=0 (e1 electrode empty), and 
1 for Ac=A (e1 electrode full). It is defined Zc (ff=0)=Znc as the 
impedance magnitude of the sensor without cells.

inform more accurate from these variations, being r the change 
of impedance magnitude for the two-electrode with cells (Zc) 
with respect to the system without them (Znc). The graphics of r 
versus frequency is plotted in Fig. 5, for a cell-to-electrode 
coverage ff from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1, using a Rgap=90 k . 
The size of the electrode is 32x32 
m2 [9,10]. It can be 
identified again the frequency range where the sensitivity to 
cells is high at 100kHz, represented by r increments. For a 
given frequency, each normalized impedance value of r can be 
linked with its ff, being possible the cell detection and 
estimation of the covered area Ac. Even more, area covered can 
be intrepreted as consequence than two o more cells, allowing 
cell count for a given cell size. 
From Fig. 5, it can be deduced that models of electrode-cell 
electrical performance can be used to derive the overlapping 
area in cell-electrode systems, useful for biological studies. It 
can be observed how the curve fits well with the frequency 
range, placing the maximum r value around 100 kHz, as 
predicts the FEM simulations [9, 10]. A value of Rgap= 90k  
was selected for this curve, representing a maximum value of 
the r curve with ff=0.69, which represents the ratio (Ac/A), for 
a cell size of 30 m diameter represented at figure obtained 
using FEM simulations [10]. Impedance sensor curves at 
figures 4 and 5 were obtained using SpectreHDL [15] mixed-
mode simulator, with Analog Hardware Description Language 
(AHDL) for circuits in Fig. 3. An advantage of using AHDL 
models is the possibility of including non-linear performance of 
circuit elements, in our case, the frequency squared-root 
function at the Warburg impedance.

IV. CELL CULTURE APPLICATIONS 
A: Electrode Model 
The proposed model based in Fig 3 has three main 
parameters: the electrode area (A), the fill-factor (ff), and the 
resistance of the gap region (Rgap). Technology data were 
included and simulation results obtained to model a 
commercial electrode: 8W10E, from Applied Biophysics [12]. 
It is composed by eight wells; each one contains ten circular 
gold microelectrodes, with 250 m diameter. Ten sensing 
electrodes, in paralell, were used for e1 and only one common 
reference electrode, much larger than sensing ones. Figure 6 
represents the normalized impedance r expected for these 
electrodes, for Rgap=22k , if fill factor changes from electrodes 
without cell on top (ff=0.1) to near those fully covered (ff=0.9). 
Values of Rgap can be used to match the models to observed 
performance. In Fig. 7, Rgap values were changed for ff=0.9, 
observing large r changes. Finally, it was also modifyed the 
electrode area for Rgap=22k  and ff=0.9, showing the results at 
Fig. 8. It can be observed that optimal working frequency is 
near the proposed by the electrode factory (around 4 kHz), and 
that electrode area covered by cells can be approximated by 
using the fill factor parameters. The performance curves 
obtained before can be used to fit experimental results to 
proposed model and find relevant biometric characteristics.

B: Cell growth 
In Fig. 9a it is shown the growth curve obtained by us 
during seven days using 8W10E sensors with a similar setup in 
[8]. AA8 cells for chinese hamster were seeded initially, in an 
approximated number of 5000. The impedance range is around 
1220  (380
1600
. Considering an initial cell number of 
5000 very low, we take the initial impedance as due to no-cell 
impedance value (Znc). At t=6000 min, the medium was 
changed, and the confluent phase was achieved at t = 8500 min 
approximately. The maximum experimental value given from 
eq. (1) is around r = 3.1, as illustrates Fig. 9b. We consider in 
our model that the electrodes are aproximatelly fully covered 
by cells for ff=0.9, the value of Rgap that better fits is 22k . 
System response corresponds to r-values illustrated in Fig. 6. 
From these curves, it can be obtained the fill factor at different 
times. Table I summarized the relative normalized impedance 
values r at several times. Using Fig. 6 for the sensor response, 
fill factor is calculated at every instant. For a well area of 0.8 
cm2, the maximum cell number goes from 0.8x106 to 1.6x106. 
Number of cells, ncell, in Table I, is obtained from 0.8x106 
expected final cell number. A value of Znc=380  for r calculus 
in eq. (1) was considered.

C: Dosimetry 
Experiments to characterize the influence of some drugs in 
cell growth were done. The objective is to proof that proposed 
model allows counting cell number at different dosis. It was 
considered the AA8 cell line and as drug, six different doses of 
MG132 for growth inhibition (from 0.2 M to 50 M). After 72 
hours normal cell growth, the medium was changed and the 
drug added at different doses: 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 50 M for 
wells 3 to 8 respectively. Well 2 is the control. 
Measured impedances for the 8 wells are at Fig. 10, for 
4kHz working frequency. At the end of the experiment can be 
observed that impedance decreases as drug dosis increases. 
Control (W2) is full of cells with the maximum impedance, 
while maximum dosis (W8) has the lowest resistance, at the 
botton. The black line (W1) represents the electrode-solution 
impedance. After the medium change (t=4000min), it is 
observed a decreasing impedance below the initial baseline 
level (400 ) that we cannot explain. Final impedance values at 
8000min, Zc, were considered, at Table II. From Znc and Zc, r 
values are calculated in third colunm. Using curves for r versus 
frequency in Fig. 6, ff estimated values from proposed model 
are obtained. The cell number at the end of the experiment was 
also count and shown at the last column for each well. 
Considering ffmax=0.9 for a measured cell number of 8.06x105, 
the expected values for ff are calculated. 
The same data are summarized at Table III for 2, 4 and 
10kHz frequencies respectively. The better agreement it is 
obtained at 4kHz in fill factor (ff). It is observed that the 
impedance baseline, Znc, for r calculus decreases with 
frequency due probably to electrode impedance dependence.

For medium resistance (W1) and high drug concentrations 
wells (W6-W8), the resistance measured is below to Znc, so eq. 
(1) can no be applied for r calculation.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
This work describes an area dependent model for cell-
electrode systems and its application to measure and identify 
cells during cell culture protocols. A practical circuit for 
electrode-solution-cell simulation was employed, using an 
AHDL description for commercial electrodes, obtaining a good 
matching. Optimal measurement frequency was identified near 
4 kHz. It was proposed the cell growth evolution study based 
on 8W10E electrode models. Curves obtained experimentally, 
allows the real time growth monitoring by fitting the Rgap 
parameter. An estimation of the number of cells was obtained 
by using sensor curves calculated from electrical model 
proposed. Dosimetry experiments reproduce similar conditions 
than cell growth, but in this case, it is added a growth inhibitor 
at different dosis. There is observed a decreasing impedance, 
below the baseline expected (Znc) that we can not explain. 
However, for the control and small drug dosis, impedance 
curves are perfectly aligned. It was fitted a proposed model 
with Rgap=22k  to explain experiemental data. Deviations from 
data are over 10-20% in fill factor, more accurate for 4 kHz. 
The deviations in fill factors measured are not small, being 
required to analize the influence of error sources to increase the 
system performance. First, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) should 
be increased at the setup. Second, proposed model has the 
advantage that need only one parameter (Rgap), versus other 
reported model using three parameters [8]. One parameter 
model makes easy to fit experimental data, but can introduce 
inaccuracy. The possibility to add more parameters to the 
model should be considered in the future.
